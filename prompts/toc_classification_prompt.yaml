  Additional Context:
  - The page content may include section titles, page numbers, or other formatting typically found in a table of contents.
  - The presence of multiple section titles or a structured list of contents is a strong indication of a table of contents page.
  - Pages with regular text, paragraphs, or a few section headings are less likely to be part of the table of contents.
  - Pages primarily containing narrative descriptions, procedural text, or detailed content about specific topics are unlikely to be part of the table of contents.
  - Look for typical table of contents elements such as hierarchical numbering (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.1), dot leaders (......), and alignment of section titles with corresponding page numbers.

  Based on the provided page content and the additional context, does this page appear to be part of the table of contents? Respond with a JSON object.
