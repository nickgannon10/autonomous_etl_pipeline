At the close of business on the record date, 164,717,883 shares of Billtrust common stock\nwere issued and outstanding, approximately 16.1% of which were held by Billtrust\u2019s directors and executive officers.\nWe currently expect that, in addition to the shares to be voted in favor under the voting and support agreements, all\nof Billtrust\u2019s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although no director or executive officer\nis obligated to do so (except for Mr. Lane pursuant to the voting and support agreements).\nThe presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Billtrust\ncommon stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date will constitute\na quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. If you submit a properly\nexecuted proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted for purposes of calculating whether\na quorum is present at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an\nadjournment or postponement and will subject Billtrust to additional expense.\nYou may cast one vote for each share of Billtrust common stock that you own at the close of business on the\nrecord date. Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of Billtrust\ncommon stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date in accordance with Delaware law. The\nproposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Billtrust to\nits named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger requires the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively at the special meeting (provided that a quorum is present). The\nproposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies, requires the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Billtrust common stock present or represented by proxy\nand entitled to vote at the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present).\nAn abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from\nvoting. At the special meeting, abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Because\nunder Delaware law the adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of\nBilltrust common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date, abstentions and a complete failure to\nvote (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of\nshares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a broker, bank or other nominee to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or\nother nominee) will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further solicitation of\nproxies. Because the other proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or\nnegatively at the special meeting, abstentions and a failure to vote (including the failure of a record owner to execute\nand return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a broker, bank or other\nnominee to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of such\nproposal.\nIf no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned\nand not revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted for (i) the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e (ii) the proposal to\napprove, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBilltrust to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger\u037e and (iii) the proposal to\napprove the adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies, if there are not\nsufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement.\nInterests of Billtrust\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 49)",

The ultimate\namount you would receive in an appraisal proceeding may be more than, the\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsame as or less than the amount you would have received under the merger agreement. To exercise your\nappraisal rights, you must comply with the requirements of the DGCL. See \u201cAppraisal Rights of Stockholders\u201d\nbeginning on page 84 of this proxy statement and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute, Section 262 of\nthe DGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to adopt the merger agreement?\nA:\nThe proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of\nBilltrust common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date. In addition, under the merger\nagreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. A failure to vote\nyour shares of Billtrust common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote against\nthe merger proposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be\npaid by Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger?\nA:\nThe named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, approval of which is not required to\ncomplete the merger, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively at the\nspecial meeting (provided a quorum is present or represented by proxy).\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to\nsolicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are not sufficient\nvotes at the time of such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement?\nA:\nThe proposal to adjourn the special meeting, the approval of which is not required to complete the merger,\nrequires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Billtrust common stock present in person\nor represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present).\nNotwithstanding the inclusion or approval or disapproval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting,\nwhether or not a quorum is present at the special meeting, the chairperson of the special meeting may adjourn\nthe special meeting to another place, if applicable, date or time, in accordance with Billtrust\u2019s Amended and\nRestated Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d).\nQ:\nDo any of Billtrust\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to\nmy interests as a stockholder?\nA:\nIn considering the recommendation of the Billtrust board of directors with respect to the merger proposal, you\nshould be aware that our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, the interests of our Billtrust stockholders generally. The Billtrust board of\ndirectors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the\nmerger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that the merger agreement be approved by the\nstockholders of Billtrust. See \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) - Interests of Billtrust\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\nin the Merger\u201d beginning on page 49 and \u201cAdvisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related\nCompensation (Proposal 2)\u201d beginning on page 88.\nQ:\nHow will Mr. Lane and the Bain Capital Venture Entities vote the shares of Billtrust common stock they\nhold?\nA:\nIn connection with the execution of the merger agreement, and as a condition to Parent\u2019s willingness to enter\ninto the merger agreement, Mr. Lane (individually and through certain affiliated trusts) and the Bain Capital\nVenture Entities have each entered into separate voting and support agreements with Parent. The shares\nbeneficially owned by Mr. Lane (individually and through certain affiliated trusts) and the Bain Capital Venture\nEntities represent, in the aggregate, approximately 33.3% of the outstanding shares of Billtrust common stock.\nMr. Lane (individually and through certain affiliated trusts) and the Bain Capital Venture Entities have agreed, on\nthe terms and subject to the conditions set forth in their respective voting and support agreements, to vote their\nshares of Billtrust common stock in favor of, among other things, the merger and the adoption of the merger\nagreement, and against, among other things, any proposal relating to a competing transaction involving\nBilltrust. See \u201cThe Transaction Agreements-Voting and Support Agreements\u201d beginning on page 80.\n \n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nA:\nIn order to complete the merger, Billtrust must obtain the stockholder approval of the proposal to adopt the\nmerger agreement described in this proxy statement and the other closing conditions under the merger\nagreement must be satisfied or waived. The parties to the merger agreement currently expect to complete the\nmerger in the fourth quarter of 2022, although Billtrust cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all.\nBecause the merger is subject to a number of conditions, the exact timing of the merger cannot be determined at\nthis time.\nQ:\nWhat conditions must be satisfied to complete the merger?\nA:\nThere are several conditions which must be satisfied to complete the merger, including, among other things, the\nexpiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, compliance with certain other\nregulatory filings and obtaining certain other regulatory approvals. The obligation of each party to consummate\nthe merger is also conditioned on the other party\u2019s representations and warranties being true and correct\n(subject to certain materiality standards) and the other party having performed in all material respects its\nobligations under the merger agreement (subject to certain qualifications). Consummation of the merger is not\nsubject to any financing condition.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and act upon a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,\ncertain compensation that will or may be paid by Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or\notherwise relates to the merger?\nA:\nSEC rules require Billtrust to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve any agreements or understandings\nand compensation that will or may be paid by Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or\notherwise relates to in connection with the merger. Approval of this proposal by Billtrust\u2019s stockholders is not\nrequired to complete the merger.\nQ:\nDo you expect the merger to be taxable to Billtrust stockholders?\nA:\nThe exchange of Billtrust common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes and may also be taxable under state and local and other non-U.S. tax laws. In general, if you\nare a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement), you will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between (1) the merger consideration you receive and (2) the adjusted tax basis of the shares of\ncommon stock you surrender in the merger. Assuming you are a non-U.S. holder, your exchange of shares of\nBilltrust common stock for the merger consideration generally will not result in U.S. federal income tax unless\nyou have certain connections with the United States. You should read the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement and consult your tax\nadvisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your particular\ncircumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing\njurisdiction.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is November 4, 2022. Only stockholders of record at the close of\nbusiness on that date are entitled to attend and vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement\nthereof. The only class of stock that can be voted at the meeting is Billtrust common stock. Each outstanding\nshare of Billtrust common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the special meeting. At the\nclose of business on the record date, there were 164,717,883 shares of Billtrust common stock issued and\noutstanding, approximately 16.1% of which were held by Billtrust\u2019s directors and executive officers. We currently\nexpect that all of Billtrust\u2019s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although no\ndirector or executive officer is obligated to do so.\nQ:\nWho may attend the special meeting?\nA:\nOnly stockholders as of the close of business on November 4, 2022, or their duly appointed proxies, and invited\nguests of Billtrust may attend the meeting. \u201cStreet name\u201d holders (those whose shares are held through a broker,\nbank or other nominee) who wish to vote at the special meeting must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from\nyour broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.\n \n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWho is soliciting my vote?\nA:\nThe Billtrust board of directors is soliciting your proxy, and Billtrust will bear the cost of soliciting proxies.\nGeorgeson has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Georgeson will be paid a solicitation fee of\napproximately $18,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other\nadvisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of\nproxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians, and other like parties to the\nbeneficial owners of shares of Billtrust common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their\nreasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic\nmail or other electronic medium by Georgeson or, without additional compensation, by certain of Billtrust\u2019s\ndirectors, officers and employees.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nCarefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement, including its annexes. Whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting, please submit a proxy\nto vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the special\nmeeting.\nQ:\nHow do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record, there are four methods by which you may vote at the special meeting:\n\u2022\nInternet:\u2003To vote over the internet, log on to the voting site indicated on your proxy card. If you vote\nover the internet, you do not have to mail in a proxy card.\n\u2022\nTelephone:\u2003To vote by telephone, call the toll-free number indicated on your proxy card.

If you return your signed proxy card to us before the special meeting, we\nwill vote your shares as you direct.\n\u2022\nIn Person:\u2003You may attend the special meeting and cast your vote there.\nWhether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy, whether by internet, by telephone\nor by mail, to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the meeting and vote your shares in person,\neven if you have already voted by proxy. If you later decide to vote at the special meeting, your proxy prior to\nthe special meeting will be revoked\u037e however, attending the special meeting will not revoke your written, internet\nor telephone proxy, as the case may be, unless you specifically request revocation or cast a ballot at the special\nmeeting. Please choose only one method to cast your vote by proxy. We encourage you to vote over the\ninternet, which is a convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternative to returning a proxy card by mail.\nQ:\nHow do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker (street name)?\nA:\nIf your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, often referred to as held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you will\nreceive a form from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares should be\nvoted. You should contact your broker, bank or other nominee with questions about how to provide or revoke\nyour instructions.\nQ:\nCan I change my vote after I submit my proxy?\nA:\nYes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting or any\nadjournment or postponement thereof. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke\nyour proxy in any one of three ways:\n\u2022\nYou may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, whether over the internet, by\ntelephone or by mail\u037e\n\u2022\nYou may send a written notice prior to the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof)\nthat you are revoking your proxy to the Office of the Secretary, BTRS Holdings Inc., 1009 Lenox Drive,\nSuite 101, Lawrenceville, New Jersey 08648\u037e or\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nYou may attend the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) and vote in person.\nIf your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will have to follow the instructions provided\nby your broker, bank or other nominee to change or revoke your proxy.\nIf you have questions about how to vote or change your vote, please contact Georgeson, the firm assisting us\nin the solicitation of proxies, toll-free at 888-666-2594.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Billtrust common stock before the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of the merger. If you own shares of\ncommon stock as of the close of business on the record date but transfer your shares prior to the date of the\nspecial meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but the right to receive the merger\nconsideration will pass to the person who holds your shares immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Billtrust common stock after the special meeting but before the effective\ntime?\nA:\nIf you transfer your shares after the special meeting but before the effective time, you will have transferred the\nright to receive the merger consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares. In order to receive the\nmerger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the merger.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. If the merger is completed, the exchange agent for the merger will send you a letter of transmittal and\ninstructions for exchanging your shares of Billtrust common stock for the merger consideration. PLEASE DO\nNOT SEND ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY OR OTHERWISE SEND THEM TO\nBILLTRUST, PARENT OR THE PROXY SOLICITOR.\nQ:\nHow many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?\nA:\nThe presence at the special meeting, by attendance in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the\nshares of Billtrust common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the\nrecord date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special\nmeeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or\npostponement and will subject Billtrust to additional expense.\nQ:\nWhat if I abstain from voting?\nA:\nIf you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal,\nyour shares will still be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. If you abstain from voting\non the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting or on the proposal to adjourn the special\nmeeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of the merger agreement, it will have\nthe same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d such proposals. If you abstain from voting on the other proposal, it will\nhave no effect on the outcome of such proposal.\nQ:\nWill my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote over the internet, by mail, by\ntelephone or by attendance in person at the special meeting?\nA:\nIf you are a registered stockholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote over the internet, by\ntelephone, by mail or by attendance in person at the special meeting, your shares will not be voted at the special\nmeeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.\nIf your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee,\nyour broker, bank or other nominee may vote your shares at its discretion on routine matters, but may not vote\nyour shares on non-routine matters. Under Nasdaq rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-\nroutine matters. Accordingly, if your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you do not issue instructions to your\nbroker, bank or other nominee, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for\npurposes of determining whether a quorum exists.\n20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf you fail to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card by mail, or vote via the internet, by telephone or by\nattendance in person at the special meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to\nadopt the merger agreement and \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if\nnecessary to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the\nother proposal.\nQ:\nWhat is a broker non-vote?\nA:\nBroker non-votes are shares held by brokers and other record holders that are present or represented by proxy\nat the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker or other record holder is not instructed by the\nbeneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary\nvoting power on such proposal. Because brokers and other record holders do not have discretionary voting\nauthority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of\nshares of Billtrust common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d does not give voting instructions to the broker or other\nholder of record, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the special meeting. As a\nresult, it is expected that there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals\ndescribed in this proxy statement.\nIf you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted and\nthe effect will be the same as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the adoption\nof the merger agreement. However, a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote on the non-\nbinding proposal regarding merger-related compensation for Billtrust\u2019s named executive officers (assuming a\nquorum is present) will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal.\nQ:\nWill my shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes\nwith shares I hold of record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than\nany shares you hold of record, any shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you\nhold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as\ntrustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy\ncard for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation\nor business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement\naccount must be voted under the rules governing the account.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?\nA:\nThis means you own shares of Billtrust common stock that are registered under different names or are in more\nthan one account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a stockholder of record and other shares\nthrough a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive\nmultiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions\nfor any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares\nyou own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by\nmail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.\nQ:\nWho will count the votes?\nA:\nA representative from Georgeson will serve as the inspector of election.\nQ:\nCan I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?\nA:\nIf you are unable to attend the special meeting, you may participate by completing, signing, dating and returning\nyour proxy card or by voting over the internet or by telephone.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nA:\nBilltrust intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Billtrust\nfiles with the SEC are publicly available when filed.\n21\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by Billtrust stockholders or if the merger is not completed\nfor any other reason, Billtrust stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Billtrust common\nstock in connection with the merger. Instead, Billtrust will remain an independent public company and shares of\nBilltrust common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq.\nThe merger agreement provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances,\nBilltrust will be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of $50,245,503.85, or under certain other\ncircumstances, Billtrust may be entitled to receive a reverse termination fee of $100,491,007.71 from Parent. If\nParent commences an action or proceeding that results in a judgment against Billtrust for the payment of the\ntermination fee, Billtrust shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and\nexpenses actually incurred by Parent in connection with such action or proceeding) in an amount not to exceed\n$5,000,000 in the aggregate. If Billtrust commences an action or proceeding that results in a judgment against\nParent for the payment of the reverse termination fee, Parent shall pay to Billtrust its costs and expenses\n(including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses actually incurred by Billtrust in connection with such action\nor proceeding) in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate.\nSee the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Termination Fee Payable by Billtrust and Reverse Termination Fee Payable\nby Parent\u201d beginning on page 1\n1 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which\nsuch a termination fee or a reverse termination fee will be required to be paid.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain additional information about Billtrust?\nA:\nBilltrust will provide copies of this proxy statement and its 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, including its\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, without charge to any stockholder\nwho makes a written request to our Secretary at BTRS Holdings Inc., 1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 101, Lawrenceville,\nNew Jersey 08648.

Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be\nhouseholding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you\nrevoke your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to\nreceive a separate proxy statement and annual report, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a\nbrokerage account or Billtrust if you are a stockholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written request\nto BTRS Holdings Inc., 1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 101, Lawrenceville, New Jersey 08648, Attn: Secretary, or calling\n888-666-2594. Stockholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may\nrequest that in the future they receive a single copy by notifying Billtrust at the telephone and address set forth\nin the prior sentence. In addition, Billtrust will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or\ntelephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a\nsingle copy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.\n22\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhom should I contact if I have any questions?\nA:\nIf you have questions about the merger or the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting or desire\nadditional copies of this proxy statement or additional proxy cards or otherwise need assistance voting, you\nshould contact:\n\u202f\n1290 Avenue of the Americas, 9th Floor\nNew York, NY 10104\n\u2003\nShareholders, Banks and Brokers\nCall Toll Free: \n888-666-2594\n23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",

            "text": "Purpose of the Special Meeting\nAt the special meeting, Billtrust stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following:\n1.\nA proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger\n(Proposal 1)\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement,\u201d beginning on pages 31 and 56, respectively, of this proxy\nstatement\u037e\n2.\nA proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by\nBilltrust to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, discussed under\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)-Interests of Billtrust\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement\u037e and\n3.\nA proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional\nproxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time\nof such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement.\nBilltrust stockholders must adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If Billtrust stockholders fail to\nadopt the merger agreement, the merger will not occur. The vote on executive compensation payable in connection\nwith the merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder\nmay vote to approve the executive compensation payable in connection with the merger and vote not to adopt the\nmerger agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not\nbe binding on either Billtrust or Parent. Accordingly, because Billtrust is contractually obligated to pay the\ncompensation, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the merger\nagreement is approved and adopted and the merger is consummated, and regardless of the outcome of the advisory\nvote.\nBilltrust does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or\npostponement thereof. If any other matters are properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or\npostponement thereof for consideration, however, the holders of the proxies will have discretion to vote on these\nmatters.\nRecommendation of the Billtrust Board of Directors\nAfter careful consideration, the Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused\nthemselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) approved the merger agreement,\nthe merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the\nBilltrust board of directors in reaching its decision to authorize and approve the merger agreement and the merger can\nbe found in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)-Billtrust\u2019s Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 38\nof this proxy statement.\nThe Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the\nrollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) recommends that the Billtrust stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe proposal to adopt the merger agreement, \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,\ncertain compensation that will or may be paid by Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or\notherwise relates to the merger and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to\nsolicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at\nthe time of such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement.\n26TABLE OF CONTENTS\nRecord Date\u037e Stockholders Entitled to Vote",

If that were to\noccur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Billtrust common stock would return to the price at which it trades as\nof the date of this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and\nopportunities on the future value of your shares of Billtrust common stock.

This review includes, among other items, the consideration of potential opportunities for business\ncombinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives with a view towards strengthening Billtrust\u2019s\nbusiness and identifying opportunities to maximize stockholder value. Representatives of private equity firms and\npotential strategic partners have from time to time contacted and/or met with members of Billtrust management to\ndiscuss Billtrust\u2019s business, with a view to exploring whether to pursue a potential transaction with Billtrust.\nOn January 21, 2022, Arvindh Kumar, a representative of EQT Fund Management S.\u00e0.r.l. (\u201cEQT\u201d), reached out to\nClare Hart, a member of the Billtrust board of directors, to request an introduction to Billtrust\u2019s Chief Executive Officer\nfor the purpose of discussing a potential transaction. On February 2, 2022, Ms. Hart introduced Mr. Kumar to Flint A.\nLane, Billtrust\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Billtrust board of directors.\n32TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 1, 2022, a private equity sponsor (\u201cFinancial Sponsor A\u201d) contacted Matthew C. Harris, a member\nof the Billtrust board of directors, to request an introduction to Billtrust\u2019s Chief Executive Officer for the purpose of\ndiscussing a potential transaction. On February 9, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A and Mr. Lane\ndiscussed a potential transaction, and representatives of Financial Sponsor A provided a presentation to Mr. Lane.\nDuring this conversation, representatives of Financial Sponsor A expressed interest in pursuing a transaction with\nBilltrust and explained Financial Sponsor A\u2019s experience with both FinTech companies and take-private transactions.\nThe representatives of Financial Sponsor A offered to submit a proposal in writing with an indicative price range, if\nBilltrust was interested in a potential transaction. Later on February 9, 2022, Mr. Lane communicated the content of\nthe discussion with Financial Sponsor A to, and shared a copy of the presentation provided by Financial Sponsor A\nwith, the Billtrust board of directors, and suggested that the Billtrust board of directors discuss the approach for\nresponding to similar inbound inquiries during the next scheduled meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on\nMarch 24, 2022.\nOn February 15, 2022, Mr. Kumar and Mr. Lane discussed a potential transaction and Mr. Kumar provided a\npresentation to Mr. Lane. During this conversation, Mr. Kumar expressed interest in pursuing a transaction with\nBilltrust, explained EQT\u2019s interest in Billtrust and indicated EQT\u2019s familiarity with Billtrust. Later on February 15, 2022,\nMr. Lane communicated the content of the discussion with EQT to, and shared a copy of the presentation provided\nby Mr. Kumar with, the Billtrust board of directors.\nOn February 23, 2022, EQT submitted a non-binding proposal to Billtrust to acquire Billtrust in an all-cash\ntransaction at $10.00 per share (the \u201cFebruary 23 EQT Proposal\u201d). The closing share price of Billtrust common stock\non February 23, 2022 was $5.61 per share. Later on February 23, 2022, Mr. Lane relayed the February 23 EQT Proposal\nto the Billtrust board of directors, and suggested that the Billtrust board of directors discuss the February 23 EQT\nProposal during the next scheduled meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on March 24, 2022.\nOn March 8, 2022, Financial Sponsor A and Mr. Lane had a conversation in which Financial Sponsor A reiterated\nits interest in a potential transaction with Billtrust and offered to submit a proposal if invited to do so by Billtrust. Mr.\nLane responded that the Billtrust board of directors would consider next steps (if any) with respect to a potential\ntransaction at the next scheduled meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on March 24, 2022, regardless of whether\nFinancial Sponsor A submitted a proposal to acquire Billtrust prior to the meeting. Later on March 8, 2022, Mr. Lane\ncommunicated the content of the discussion with Financial Sponsor A to the Billtrust board of directors.\nOn March 14, 2022, Financial Sponsor A submitted a written non-binding proposal to Billtrust to acquire Billtrust\nin an all-cash transaction at $9.05 per share. Later on March 14, 2022, Mr. Lane communicated the proposal from\nFinancial Sponsor A to the Billtrust board of directors, and suggested that the Billtrust board of directors consider\nsuch proposal at its next scheduled meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on March 24, 2022.\nOn March 24, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members of management\nand representatives of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (\u201cJ.P. Morgan\u201d), longstanding financial advisor to the Billtrust\nboard of directors. During this meeting, the Billtrust board of directors considered the February 23 EQT Proposal and\nthe proposal submitted by Financial Sponsor A and determined that the Billtrust board of directors and Billtrust\nmanagement should continue evaluating the risks and benefits of a potential transaction, but that it was premature\nfor Billtrust to more actively pursue a potential transaction at this time.\nOn March 25, 2022, Mr. Lane informed EQT that the Billtrust board of directors had not yet reached a decision\nregarding whether to move forward with a potential transaction.\nOn April 13, 2022, representatives of an additional private equity sponsor (\u201cFinancial Sponsor B\u201d) and Mr. Lane\nhad a conversation in which representatives of Financial Sponsor B expressed interest in pursuing a transaction with\nBilltrust and outlined the benefits of entering into a transaction with a company owned by Financial Sponsor B\n(\u201cFinancial Sponsor B Portfolio Company\u201d).\nOn April 19, 2022, Mr. Lane met with Mr. Kumar. During this meeting, Mr. Kumar reiterated EQT\u2019s interest in a\npotential transaction with Billtrust.\nOn April 26, 2022, Mr. Lane and a representative of Financial Sponsor A met for dinner and discussed the future\nof business-to-business commerce and possible opportunities related to a potential transaction with Billtrust.\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn April 27, 2022, Mr. Lane and the Chief Executive Officer of Financial Sponsor B Portfolio Company met for\ndinner and discussed possible opportunities related to a potential transaction with Billtrust.\nOn May 3, 2022, Financial Sponsor A submitted to Billtrust a revised non-binding proposal to acquire Billtrust in\nan all-cash transaction at $10.00 per share. Later on May 3, 2022, Mr. Lane communicated the revised proposal from\nFinancial Sponsor A to certain senior members of management of Billtrust, noting that the revised proposal was\nunexpected because previously Financial Sponsor A had indicated to Mr. Lane that it was not interested in a\npotential transaction at the $10.00 per share price level. Also on May 3, 2022, Mr. Lane communicated the revised\nproposal from Financial Sponsor A to the Billtrust board of directors.\nOn May 26, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor B and the Chief Executive Officer of Financial Sponsor B\nPortfolio Company met with Mr. Lane to reiterate its interest in a potential transaction with Billtrust and requested\nthat Financial Sponsor B be included if Billtrust decided to move forward with a sale process.\nOn May 26, 2022, Mr. Lane provided a general update to the Billtrust board of directors regarding recent\nconversations with EQT, Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor B related to a potential transaction.\nOn May 27, 2022, Mr. Kumar and Mr. Lane discussed the February 23 EQT Proposal and whether this proposal\nwas contingent on fluctuations in Billtrust\u2019s stock price. EQT confirmed that material fluctuations in Billtrust\u2019s stock\nprice could lead it to modify the terms of its proposal.\nOn June 8, 2022, Mr. Lane met with a representative of Financial Sponsor A, during which Financial Sponsor A\nreiterated its interest in a potential transaction with Billtrust.\nOn June 16, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met and considered potential strategic transactions involving\nBilltrust. Also in attendance were members of management and representatives of Billtrust\u2019s outside counsel and\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan. At the request of the Billtrust board of directors, representatives of J.P. Morgan\nprovided a market update and discussed the environment for potential strategic transactions involving Billtrust. The\nBilltrust board of directors determined to continue to evaluate the potential for a strategic transaction, to conduct\nfurther diligence and to formally engage J.P. Morgan to assist the Billtrust board of directors in its further\nconsideration of a potential strategic transaction if there was sufficient interest from any of EQT, Financial Sponsor A\nor Financial Sponsor B in connection with pursuing a strategic transaction with Billtrust, in each case at a level of at\nleast $10.00 per share. The Billtrust board of directors also determined to direct members of management to approach\nan additional financial sponsor with whom Billtrust has an ongoing business relationship (\u201cFinancial Sponsor C\u201d) or\na possible strategic party (\u201cStrategic Party A\u201d) in pursuing a strategic transaction with Billtrust, in each case at a\nlevel of at least $10.00 per share. The Billtrust board of directors directed Mr. Lane to conduct further diligence on\neach of such parties to understand each party\u2019s respective level of interest in a potential strategic transaction with\nBilltrust. The Billtrust board of directors authorized Billtrust management to hold management presentations with,\nand provide confidential information regarding Billtrust to, each of the parties (subject to entry into appropriate\nconfidentiality undertakings that included customary standstill commitments, with such restrictions automatically\nfalling away in the event that Billtrust entered into a definitive agreement with any third party with respect to a\nmerger, sale of assets or securities or other business combination (subject to specified thresholds)). The Billtrust\nboard of directors determined that given the level of interest in a potential transaction, the Billtrust board of directors\nwould continue to evaluate whether Billtrust should run a sale process or consider strategic alternatives.\nDuring the two weeks following the June 16, 2022 meeting of the Billtrust board of directors, Mr. Lane relayed to\nFinancial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C that Billtrust was considering running a sale\nprocess. Following an introduction from Mr. Harris, Financial Sponsor C expressed interest in pursuing a transaction\nwith Billtrust. During the same period, Strategic Party A expressed interest in pursuing a strategic transaction with\nBilltrust, but indicated that it was not willing to pay a price per share of $10.00 or greater and declined to join the\npotential sale process. J.P. Morgan communicated the content of the discussion with Strategic Party A to the Billtrust\nboard of directors.\nOn June 27, 2022, at the direction of the Billtrust board of directors, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted\nand provided draft confidentiality agreements to each of EQT, Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and\nFinancial Sponsor C. In early July, Billtrust entered into confidentiality agreements with each of EQT, Financial\nSponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C. All of such confidentiality agreements\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncontained customary standstill provisions, with such restrictions automatically falling away in the event that Billtrust\nentered into a definitive agreement with any third party with respect to a merger, sale of assets or securities or other\nbusiness combination (subject to specified thresholds).\nDuring the period from July 13, 2022 until July 22, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Billtrust conducted\nmanagement presentations with each of EQT, Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C. In\naddition, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Billtrust met for dinner with representatives of each of EQT and Financial\nSponsor A but did not discuss any details of a potential transaction.\nOn July 20, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members of management and\nrepresentatives of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP (\u201cDavis Polk\u201d), Billtrust\u2019s legal counsel. After evaluating J.P. Morgan\nand discussing J.P. Morgan\u2019s qualifications, credentials and independence in connection with serving as Billtrust\u2019s\nfinancial adviser, the Billtrust board of directors approved engagement of J.P. Morgan to serve as Billtrust\u2019s financial\nadvisor to assist in evaluating the merits of a potential strategic transaction, and entry into the proposed engagement\nletter with J.P. Morgan (subject to receipt and review of the relationships disclosure from J.P. Morgan and the Billtrust\nboard of directors\u2019 confirmation that such relationships disclosure did not present any material conflicts in\nconnection with the proposed engagement). On July 21, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided a relationship\ndisclosure letter to the Billtrust board of directors.\nOn July 27, 2022, Reuters published a news article reporting that Billtrust was exploring strategic alternatives. On\nthat date, Billtrust\u2019s common stock closed at $5.68 per share, up approximately 8% from the day prior to such report.\nOn July 28, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Billtrust board of directors, sent a\nprocess letter to EQT, Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C inviting such parties to\nsubmit preliminary, non-binding indications of interest with respect to a potential transaction with Billtrust no later\nthan 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on August 11, 2022.\nDuring the period from late July to early August 2022, Billtrust and/or representatives of J.P. Morgan received\noutreach from 16 additional potential counterparties, including five potential strategic counterparties and 11 financial\nsponsors. Representatives of J.P. Morgan informed the Billtrust board of directors of such outreach. At the direction\nof the Billtrust board of directors, Billtrust and/or representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with each of these parties\ntheir interest in a potential transaction with Billtrust at a price equal to at least $10.00 per share. Based on these\nconversations, Billtrust and/or the Billtrust board of directors determined that each of these parties were not\ninterested in proceeding at the proposed valuation level or did not have the ability to do so expeditiously (other than\nEQT, Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C).\nOn August 11, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan received non-binding indications of interest from EQT,\nFinancial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C. Representatives of J.P. Morgan informed the\nBilltrust board of directors of these non-binding indications of interest. EQT provided a non-binding written\nindication of interest for an all-cash transaction at $9.00-$10.00 per share. Financial Sponsor A provided a non-\nbinding written indication of interest for an all-cash transaction at $8.10-$8.40 per share. Financial Sponsor B\nprovided a non-binding verbal indication of interest for an all-cash transaction at $8.50-$9.00 per share. Financial\nSponsor C provided a non-binding verbal indication of interest for an all-cash transaction at $8.00 per share.\nOn August 12, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met to assess the non-binding indications of interest\nreceived on August 11, 2022. Also in attendance were members of management and representatives of Davis Polk and\nJ.P. Morgan. At the request of the Billtrust board of directors, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an overview of\nBilltrust\u2019s recent performance and reviewed the details of the non-binding indications of interest received from EQT,\nFinancial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C. Following the departure of the representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan, the Billtrust board of directors discussed the other unsolicited indications of interest that had been\nreceived following the Reuters news article of July 27, 2022. The Billtrust board of directors determined that based on\nthe initial indications of interest received, it was in the best interests of Billtrust to inform each such party that their\nproposal was not a basis on which Billtrust would continue to discuss a potential transaction. The Billtrust board of\ndirectors also agreed that if any of the parties were to improve its indication of interest, the board would be willing to\nreconsider its determination as to whether to move forward with the sale process. The Billtrust board of directors\ndirected management to instruct each of the parties that had submitted a proposal that Billtrust would not be moving\nforward with such party in light of the value offered and other aspects of their proposal.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 12, 2022 and August 13, 2022, at the direction of the Billtrust board of directors, members of\nmanagement of Billtrust informed Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C that Billtrust\nwas terminating further discussions regarding a potential transaction based on the proposals received.\nDuring the period from August 12, 2022 until August 14, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed EQT that\nBilltrust was terminating further discussions regarding a potential transaction based on the proposals received and\ndiscussed EQT\u2019s continued interest in a potential transaction with Billtrust. Also during the same period, Mr. Lane\nand representatives of EQT held conversations in which Mr. Lane emphasized that in light of the value offered,\nBilltrust would not be moving forward with a potential transaction, and EQT requested the opportunity to submit a\nrevised proposal.\nFollowing such conversations, on August 15, 2022, EQT submitted to Billtrust and representatives of J.P.\nMorgan a revised, written non-binding indication of interest to acquire Billtrust for a per share price of $10.00 in cash\n(the \u201cAugust 15 EQT Proposal\u201d).\nOn August 15, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members of management\nand representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan. At the request of the Billtrust board of directors, representatives\nof J.P. Morgan provided an update regarding its recent discussions with EQT with respect to the potential sale of\nBilltrust, including the August 15 EQT Proposal. Members of the Billtrust board of directors considered the August\n15 EQT Proposal and discussed whether it was likely that EQT would improve its offer to acquire Billtrust. The\nBilltrust board of directors discussed whether a sale of Billtrust to EQT at the indicative price referenced in the\nAugust 15 EQT Proposal would maximize value for Billtrust\u2019s stockholders as compared to remaining an independent\ncompany. The Billtrust board of directors decided not to make a determination regarding whether to engage further\nwith EQT in order to provide the members of the Billtrust board of directors with additional time to consider the\nAugust 15 EQT Proposal and to see if there were any other near-term developments with respect to the sale process.\nThe Billtrust board of directors decided to reconvene at a later date to further discuss and decide what actions, if any,\nBilltrust should take in response to the August 15 EQT Proposal.\nOn August 21, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members of management\nand representatives of Davis Polk. Mr. Lane provided an update on recent conversations with EQT, and discussed\nthe likelihood that EQT would proceed with a transaction consistent with the terms of the August 15 EQT Proposal.\nThe Billtrust board of directors determined that it was advisable and in the best interests of Billtrust\u2019s stockholders to\nmove forward with due diligence at this juncture and directed management to continue engaging with EQT with\nrespect to due diligence.\nOn August 28, 2022, EQT was granted access to a virtual data room containing certain non-public information\nregarding Billtrust. Following such date, through the execution of the merger agreement, representatives of Billtrust,\nEQT, and their respective advisors held a number of telephonic conferences regarding due diligence matters.\nOn August 31, 2022, Davis Polk provided a draft of the merger agreement to Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP\n(\u201cWeil\u201d), outside counsel to EQT. On September 7, 2022, Weil shared a draft of the voting and support agreements.\nThereafter, during September 2022, Weil and Davis Polk exchanged drafts and negotiated the terms of the merger\nagreement and the ancillary transaction documents (including restrictive covenant agreements and the voting and\nsupport agreements).\nOn September 1, 2022, Mr. Lane and representatives of EQT met for dinner and discussed the proposed\ntransaction.\nOn September 22, 2022, Mr. Lane and representatives of EQT met for dinner, during which EQT reaffirmed its\ncommitment to the proposed transaction.\nOn September 23, 2022, representatives of Billtrust, EQT, Davis Polk and Weil met via video conference to\nnegotiate the outstanding issues in the merger agreement, including, among others, Billtrust\u2019s remedies if EQT were\nto breach its obligations to complete the transaction, the amount of the break-up fee potentially payable by Billtrust if\nthe merger agreement were to be terminated in certain circumstances and the approach for entry into or amendment of\nmaterial contracts by Billtrust between signing and closing and the outside date and issuance of equity prior to\nconsummation of the transaction. On the evening of September 23, 2022, Davis Polk shared a markup of the merger\nagreement with Weil reflecting the outcome of these negotiations.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 23, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan shared an updated relationship disclosure letter with the\nBilltrust board of directors.\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2022, a representative of EQT reported to representatives of J.P. Morgan and,\nsubsequently, to Mr. Lane, the outcome of EQT\u2019s investment committee meeting. Citing challenging market\nconditions and EQT\u2019s current fundraising process, a representative of the EQT deal team indicated that EQT\u2019s\ninvestment committee had instructed EQT to reduce its total fund commitment to a potential transaction with Billtrust\nfrom the then-current level of approximately $1.3 billion to $1 billion or less. In light of this instruction, and reduced\ntotal fund commitment, EQT conveyed verbally a revised nonbinding proposal (the \u201cSeptember 24 EQT Proposal\u201d)\nwith the following key terms: (i) the Bain Capital Venture Entities and an additional stockholder of Billtrust that had\nnot been involved in the sale process (the \u201cAdditional Stockholder\u201d) would receive $8.00 per share in cash, (ii) all\nother stockholders of Billtrust would receive $10.00 per share in cash and (iii) Mr. Lane would agree in conjunction\nwith entry into the merger agreement to \u201croll over\u201d 50% of his pretax proceeds into EQT\u2019s investment vehicle, as a\nresult of which Mr. Lane would continue to have an ownership interest in Billtrust post-closing.\nAlso on September 24, 2022, after Mr. Lane apprised Mr. Harris, a Managing Director of Bain Capital Venture\nInvestors, LLC, of the September 24 EQT Proposal, Mr. Harris indicated to Mr. Lane that the Bain Capital Venture\nEntities were not willing to accept a lower per share price than the rest of Billtrust\u2019s stockholders. In light of Bain\u2019s\nunwillingness to proceed on the basis of the September 24 EQT Proposal, and the fact that the Additional\nStockholder had not been involved in Billtrust\u2019s consideration of a potential transaction, Billtrust did not contact the\nAdditional Stockholder to discuss the September 24 EQT Proposal.\nOn the morning of September 25, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members\nof management and representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan. After receiving an update, the Billtrust board of\ndirectors discussed the September 24 EQT Proposal. The Billtrust board of directors determined that the September\n24 EQT Proposal was not viable in light of Bain Capital Ventures\u2019 rejection of the proposed differential treatment of\nstockholders and directed Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris to provide that feedback to EQT.\nShortly thereafter, on September 25, 2022, Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris provided to EQT the feedback from the\nBilltrust board of directors.\nDuring this conversation, the representatives of EQT told Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris that EQT would be willing to\nproceed on the following basis (the \u201cSeptember 25 EQT Proposal\u201d): (i) all stockholders of Billtrust would receive\n$9.50 per share in cash and (ii) $125,000,000 of equity \u201croll over\u201d into EQT\u2019s investment vehicle, split evenly between\nthe Bain Capital Venture Entities and Mr. Lane. In addition, it is anticipated that Mr. Lane will be appointed to the\nboard of the surviving corporation following the merger, however Mr. Lane will have no contractual right to such\nappointment and will be subject to removal by EQT at any time in its sole discretion.\nLater on September 25, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met again, and also in attendance were members of\nmanagement and representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan. Mr. Lane updated the Billtrust board of directors on\nthe discussions with EQT and relayed the September 25 EQT Proposal. Davis Polk advised the Billtrust board of\ndirectors about the implications of the September 25 EQT Proposal on the roles of Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris in the\nprocess (in light of the \u201croll over\u201d component of the September 25 EQT Proposal), and the Billtrust board of directors\ndiscussed those implications. The Billtrust board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of the\nBilltrust stockholders for Billtrust to continue discussions with EQT regarding a potential transaction on the basis of\nthe September 25 EQT Proposal. Later on September 25, 2022, Weil shared a draft of the rollover and contribution\nagreements.\nOn September 27, 2022, representatives of Billtrust, Davis Polk, EQT and Weil met via video conference to\nresolve the outstanding points in the merger agreement.\nOn the evening of September 27, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members\nof management and representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan. Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris recused themselves.\nCopies of the merger agreement, the other transaction agreements, a financial presentation by J.P. Morgan and a legal\npresentation by Davis Polk had been provided to the Billtrust board of directors in advance of the meeting. A\nrepresentative of Davis Polk reviewed with the Billtrust board of directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law\nand the material terms of the merger agreement and the other transaction agreements. A representative from J.P.\nMorgan presented J.P. Morgan\u2019s financial analysis of the $9.50 per share\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nin cash merger consideration and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated\nSeptember 28, 2022, to the Billtrust board of directors to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and subject\nto the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the $9.50 per share in cash merger consideration was fair, from\na financial point of view, to the holders of the Class 1 common stock in the merger (other than holders of Excluded\nShares, as defined below). All of the directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who had recused themselves in\nlight of the rollover and contribution agreements) approved the merger agreement, the ancillary documents and the\ntransaction.\nLater on the night of September 27, 2022 and into the early morning of September 28, 2022, Davis Polk and Weil\nfinalized the merger agreement and other transaction documents.\nEarly on September 28, 2022, before the opening of trading on the Nasdaq, the merger agreement and other\napplicable transaction documents were executed, and Billtrust and EQT publicly disclosed the proposed transaction.\nBilltrust\u2019s Reasons for the Merger",

            "text": "Billtrust\u2019s Reasons for the Merger\nAt a meeting duly called and held on September 27, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane\nand Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above)\ndetermined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, and in the\nbest interests of, Billtrust and its stockholders and approved, adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement\nand the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Billtrust board of directors\n(other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements\nmentioned above) also resolved that the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of\nBilltrust at a special meeting of stockholders and to recommend that the stockholders of Billtrust vote to adopt the\nmerger agreement. The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in\nlight of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) consulted with Billtrust\u2019s senior management and\noutside legal and financial advisors and considered a number of factors, including the following principal factors (not\nin any relative order of importance) that the Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who\nrecused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) believed to support its\ndecision:\n\u2022\nthe Billtrust board of directors\u2019 (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the\nrollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) belief that the merger was more favorable to\nBilltrust\u2019s stockholders than the alternative of remaining a standalone independent company, which belief\nwas based on and informed by consideration of a number of factors, risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nBilltrust\u2019s business, current and projected financial performance and condition and future prospects in\nrelation to the merger consideration of $9.50 per share,\n\u2022\nthe uncertain returns to Billtrust\u2019s stockholders if Billtrust were to remain independent, taking into\naccount, in particular, management\u2019s financial projections of the future financial performance and\nearnings of Billtrust, including those set forth below under \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)-Projected\nFinancial Information\u201d and the risks involved in achieving those returns,\n\u2022\ngeneral industry, economic and market conditions, both on a historical and on a prospective basis,\nand\n\u2022\ncurrent information regarding (i) Billtrust\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, operations,\ntechnology, products, services, management, competitive position and strategic business goals and\nobjectives, (ii) geopolitical conditions and changing regulatory environment, which could affect\nBilltrust\u2019s business, and (iii) opportunities and competitive factors within Billtrust\u2019s industry,\n\u2022\nthe Billtrust board of directors\u2019 (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the\nrollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) belief that the risks and challenges to Billtrust\u2019s\nbusiness described above, and in Billtrust\u2019s SEC filings, create substantial execution risks relative to the\n$9.50 per share price in the merger,\n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger consideration is all cash, so that the transaction will allow Billtrust\u2019s stockholders\nto realize a fair value, in cash, for their investment and provides such stockholders certainty of value for\ntheir shares,\n38TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe fact that, during the period leading up to the execution of the merger agreement, the Billtrust board of\ndirectors explored and evaluated various potential strategic alternatives, including remaining as a\nstandalone public company, none of which alternatives was deemed more favorable to Billtrust\u2019s\nstockholders than the merger,\n\u2022\nthe fact that Billtrust and its financial advisor were contacted by a number of parties (including following\nthe publication of the Reuters article on July 27, 2022 stating that Billtrust was exploring strategic\nalternatives),\n\u2022\nthe fact that Billtrust\u2019s exploration of potential strategic alternatives involved a third-party solicitation\nprocess involving the group of potentially most interested parties (including actively seeking proposals\nfrom additional parties) that Billtrust and its advisors believed were capable of delivering an executable\nproposal, in addition to Parent, which included both strategic and financial potential acquirors, three of\nwhich, in addition to Parent, entered into confidentiality agreements with Billtrust and received information\nrelated to Billtrust, and that Parent submitted the highest final offer to Billtrust in connection with such\nprocess after active negotiations and multiple rounds of bidding,\n\u2022\nthe fact that Billtrust did not enter into any exclusivity arrangements with Parent and did not negotiate with\nParent on a contractually exclusive basis,\n\u2022\ncurrent and historical market prices of Billtrust common stock, including the market performance of Billtrust\ncommon stock relative to other participants in Billtrust\u2019s industry and general market indices, and the fact\nthat the merger consideration represented an attractive premium of more than 64% to Billtrust\u2019s closing\nstock price on September 27, 2022, the last trading day before the announcement of the merger, and more\nthan a 77% premium above the trailing 90-day volume weighted average stock price for the period ended\nSeptember 23, 2022,\n\u2022\nthe fact that Billtrust\u2019s legal and financial advisors assisted Billtrust throughout the process and\nnegotiations and updated the Billtrust board of directors directly and regularly, which provided the Billtrust\nboard of directors with additional perspectives on the negotiations in addition to those of Billtrust\u2019s\nmanagement,\n\u2022\nthe Billtrust board of directors\u2019 (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the\nrollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) view that the merger agreement was the product of\narm\u2019s-length negotiation and contained customary terms and conditions,\n\u2022\nthe timing of the merger and the risk that if Billtrust did not accept the offer by Parent (as provided for in\nthe merger agreement), it may not have another opportunity to do so or to accept a comparable\nopportunity,\n\u2022\nthe availability of statutory appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the merger for Billtrust\nstockholders who properly exercise their rights under the DGCL,\n\u2022\nthe oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Billtrust board of directors on September 27, 2022, which\nwas confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated September 28, 2022, as to the fairness, from a financial\npoint of view and as of that date, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of Billtrust\u2019s Class 1\ncommon stock (other than the Excluded Shares, as defined under \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)-Opinion of\nBilltrust\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d), which opinion was based on and subject to the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, as more fully described\nunder \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)-Opinion of Billtrust\u2019s Financial Advisor,\u201d\n\u2022\nthe fact that the voting and support agreements entered into by Mr. Lane and the Bain Capital Venture\nEntities (who together beneficially own approximately 33.3% of Billtrust\u2019s outstanding common stock) will\nterminate automatically upon the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement (including if Billtrust\ndecides to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with a third party\nproviding for a superior proposal) or the effective time of the merger, as described in the section entitled\n\u201cVoting and Support Agreements\u201d beginning on page 80 of this proxy statement\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe

would reasonably be expected to lead to superior proposals, the Billtrust board of\ndirectors\u2019 ability to (subject to the terms of the merger agreement) negotiate with another party\nregarding a

circumstances,\n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger agreement is not subject to a financing condition, in particular, that the\nfinancing contemplated by the equity commitment letter and the debt commitment letter, together with\nBilltrust\u2019s cash on hand, were sufficient to fund the aggregate purchase price and the other payments\ncontemplated by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the merger agreement, and that Billtrust\nis a named third party beneficiary of the equity commitment letter,\n\u2022\nthe fact that that certain funds affiliated with Parent provided the termination equity commitment letter\npursuant to which such affiliates commit to provide funds to Parent for the purpose of paying the\nreverse termination fee and certain of Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s other obligations under the merger\nagreement,\n\u2022\nthe fact that Billtrust and Parent agreed to take all actions (subject to certain enumerated exceptions)\nto consummate the merger, including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably possible all\nnecessary filings and obtaining certain specified regulatory approvals in connection with the merger\nor the consummation of the merger, as well as the merger agreement\u2019s significant protection against\nany regulatory impediments that could arise, as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger\u201d below, and\nThe Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the\nrollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) also considered various potentially countervailing factors in\nits deliberations related to the merger, including the following principal factors (not in any relative order of\nimportance):\n\u2022\nthe fact that holders of Billtrust\u2019s Class 1 common stock (other than Mr. Lane and the Bain Capital Venture\nEntities, each of whom will contribute a portion of their shares of Billtrust common stock to Parent in\nexchange for equity interests in Bullseye Holdings) will not have an opportunity to participate in any future\nearnings or growth of the combined company following the merger,\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the merger might not be consummated and the effect the termination of the transaction\n(and the resulting public announcement) may have on the trading price of Billtrust common stock and\nBilltrust\u2019s business, operating results and prospects, which effect is likely to be exacerbated the longer the\ntime period between the signing and any termination of the merger agreement,\n\u2022\nthat Billtrust cannot solicit other acquisition proposals, and must pay Parent a termination fee in the\namount of $50,245,503.85 if the

transactions could deter\nothers from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to Billtrust\u2019s\nstockholders,\n\u2022\nthat the restrictions imposed by the merger agreement on the conduct of Billtrust\u2019s business prior to\ncompletion of the merger, requiring Billtrust to conduct its business only in the ordinary course and\nimposing additional specific restrictions, may delay, limit or prevent Billtrust from undertaking business\nopportunities that may arise during that period,\n\u2022\nthe possible effects of the pendency (or termination) of the merger agreement on Billtrust\u2019s business,\noperating results, prospects, employees, customers and suppliers,\n\u2022\nthe significant costs involved in connection with entering into the merger

that if the merger is not consummated, Billtrust will be required to pay its own expenses associated\nwith the merger,\n\u2022\nthe fact that Billtrust\u2019s directors and officers may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or\nin addition to, those of the other Billtrust stockholders (see below in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c- Interests of Billtrust\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d),\n\u2022\nthe fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Billtrust common stock pursuant to the merger

that the consummation of the merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States and\nCyprus, and\n\u2022\nthat if Parent fails to complete the merger as a result of a breach of the merger agreement, depending upon\nthe reason for not closing, Billtrust\u2019s rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce through\nlitigation, and the success of any such action may be uncertain.\nAfter considering the foregoing potentially negative and potentially positive factors, the Billtrust board of\ndirectors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution\nagreements mentioned above) concluded that the potentially positive factors relating to the merger agreement and\nthe merger substantially outweighed the potentially negative factors.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Billtrust board of directors (other\nthan Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned\nabove) is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the Billtrust board of\ndirectors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution\nagreements mentioned above). The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused\nthemselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) did not undertake to make any\nspecific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support\nits ultimate determination. The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused\nthemselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) based its recommendation on the\ntotality of the information it considered.\nIn considering the recommendation of the Billtrust board of directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the\nmerger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are\ndifferent from, or in addition to, yours. The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who\nrecused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) was aware of and\nconsidered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger,\nand in recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Billtrust.

            "text": "Opinion of Billtrust\u2019s Financial Advisor\nPursuant to an engagement letter, Billtrust retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the\nmerger and to deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the merger.\nAt the meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on September 27, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to\nthe board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion,\nthe merger consideration to be paid to the holders of the Class 1 common stock in the merger (other than the holders\nof the Excluded Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its\nSeptember 27, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Billtrust board of directors, dated September\n28, 2022, that, as of such date, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of the Class 1 common stock (other\nthan the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated September 28, 2022, which sets forth, among other\nthings, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is\nattached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of\nJ.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion.\nThe holders of the Class 1 common stock are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion is\naddressed to the Billtrust board of directors (in its capacity as such), was directed only to the consideration to be\npaid to the holders of Class 1 common stock (other than the holders of Excluded Shares) in the merger and did not\naddress any other aspect of the merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to\nthe holders of any other class of securities, holders of the Excluded Shares, creditors or other constituencies of\nBilltrust or as to the underlying decision by Billtrust to engage in the merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion\nwas approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any\nstockholder of Billtrust as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated September 27, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Billtrust and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain\ntransactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of Billtrust with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of the Class 1 common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of Billtrust relating\nto its business (which analyses and forecasts are summarized under the sections titled \u201cCaution Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)-Projected Financial Information\u201d beginning\non pages 24 and 48, respectively of this proxy statement)\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\n42TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of Billtrust with respect to\ncertain aspects of the merger, the past and current business operations of Billtrust, the financial condition and future\nprospects and operations of Billtrust, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its\ninquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information\nthat was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Billtrust or otherwise reviewed by or\nfor J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and,\npursuant to its engagement letter with Billtrust, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such\nindependent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any\nassets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of Billtrust or Parent under any state or federal laws\nrelating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses provided to it or derived\ntherefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and\nfinancial condition of Billtrust to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such\nanalyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the merger and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be consummated as described in the merger\nagreement, and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof\nfurnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by Billtrust and\nParent in the merger agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to\nits analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to\nBilltrust with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other\nconsents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect\non Billtrust or on the contemplated benefits of the merger.\nThe financial analyses and forecasts furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by Billtrust\u2019s management. Billtrust\ndoes not publicly disclose internal financial analyses and forecasts of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection\nwith J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis of the merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public\ndisclosure. These projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and\nmay be beyond the control of Billtrust\u2019s management, including factors related to general economic and competitive\nconditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in\nsuch projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking statements, please\nrefer to the sections entitled \u201cCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 24 and \u201cThe\nMerger (Proposal 1)-Projected Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of the date of such opinion. Subsequent developments may affect J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s written opinion dated September 28, 2022, and J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise,\nor reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the\nconsideration to be paid to the holders of the Class 1 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares)\nin the merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration of,\nthe holders of any other class of securities, holders of the Excluded Shares, creditors or other constituencies of\nBilltrust or the underlying decision by Billtrust to engage in the merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with\nrespect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the\nmerger, or any class of such persons, any consideration payable in respect to Rollover Shares or any consideration\notherwise payable to any Significant Company Stockholders (as defined in the merger agreement) or any holders of\nClass 2 common stock, $0.0001 par value, of Billtrust, in each case, relative to the merger consideration to be paid to\nthe holders of the Class 1 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the merger or with respect\nto the fairness of any such compensation or consideration.\nThe terms of the merger agreement, including the merger consideration, were determined through arm\u2019s length\nnegotiations between Billtrust and Parent, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat of the Billtrust board of directors. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors\nconsidered by the Billtrust board of directors in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as\ndeterminative of the views of the Billtrust board of directors or Billtrust\u2019s management with respect to the merger or\nthe merger consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the Billtrust board of directors on September 27, 2022 and in the presentation\ndelivered to the Billtrust board of directors on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion and this\nsummary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of\nthe summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended\nto stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be\nread together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full\nnarrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the\nanalyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses. The following is a summary of the\nmaterial financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with providing its opinion.\nPublic Trading Multiples\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of Billtrust with similar data\nfor selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to Billtrust.\nThese companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations\nand businesses that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered sufficiently similar to those of\nBilltrust. However, none of the companies selected is identical to Billtrust, and certain of these companies may have\ncharacteristics that are materially different from those of Billtrust. The analyses necessarily involve complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies\ninvolved and other factors that could affect the selected companies differently than they would affect Billtrust.\nFor each of the following analyses performed by J.P. Morgan, estimated financial data for Billtrust and the\nselected companies were based on information J.P. Morgan obtained from public filings, and publicly available\ninformation obtained from FactSet Research Systems. The multiples for each of the selected companies were based\non such information. Among other calculations, with respect to Billtrust and the selected companies, J.P. Morgan\ncalculated the ratio of each company\u2019s \u201cfirm value\u201d (calculated as equity value, plus or minus, as applicable, net debt\nor net cash) as of September 23, 2022 to the analyst consensus estimates of net revenues for the calendar year 2023\nfor the applicable company (\u201cFV / CY23E Revenue\u201d).\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following tables present the results of this analysis:\nBilltrust\n \nFV / CY23E\nRevenue\nBased on share price as of September 23, 2022\n4.1x\nBased on share price as of July 26, 20221\n3.7x\n \n \nSelected Companies\n \nCore\n \nBill.com Holdings, Inc.\n11.6x\nCoupa Software Incorporated\n6.6x\nAvidXchange Holdings, Inc.\n3.3x\nFinancial software/payments\n \nEngageSmart, Inc.\n8.1x\nFlywire Corporation\n7.1x\nBlackLine, Inc.\n6.5x\nAvalara, Inc.2\n6.1x\nPaymentus Holdings, Inc.\n4.0x\nDocuSign, Inc.\n4.0x\n \n1\nThe last full trading day prior to publication of news reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust.\n2\nBased on share price as of July 6, 2022, the date prior to the publication of the first news article speculating that Avalara, Inc.\nwas considering a sale transaction.\nBased on the results of this analysis and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate in its professional\njudgment and experience, J.P. Morgan selected a trading multiple reference range of 3.3x to 6.6x for Billtrust\u2019s FV /\nCY23E Revenue. After applying such ranges to Billtrust\u2019s forecasted revenue for the calendar year 2023, based on\nBilltrust management\u2019s projections, the analysis resulted in an implied per share equity value range, rounded to the\nnearest $0.25, of approximately $4.75 to $9.00 for the Class 1 common stock. The range of implied per share equity\nvalues for the Class 1 common stock was compared to (i) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.77 on September 23,\n2022, (ii) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.26 on July 26, 2022, the last full trading day prior to publication of\nnews reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust, and (iii) the amount of the merger consideration of $9.50\nper share.\nSelected Transaction Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving businesses which\nJ.P. Morgan judged to be similar to Billtrust\u2019s business (or aspects thereof) based on J.P. Morgan\u2019s experience and\nfamiliarity with the industries in which Billtrust operates. Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the transactions below,\nand calculated the ratio of each target company\u2019s firm value to the target company\u2019s estimated net revenue for the\nnext twelve months following the announcement of the applicable transaction (the \u201cFV / NTM Revenue\u201d), based on\npublicly available information:\nAnnouncement Date\nAcquirer\nTarget\nFV / NTM Revenue\nAugust 8, 2022\nVista Equity Partners\nManagement, LLC\nAvalara, Inc.\n8.8x\nApril 14, 2022\nAccel-KKR Company LLC\nBasware Corporation\n3.9x\nMarch 21, 2022\nThoma Bravo, LLC\nAnaplan, Inc.\n13.9x1 \nDecember 17, 2021\nThoma Bravo, LLC\nBottomline Technologies, Inc.\n5.1x\nJune 11, 2018\nWorkday, Inc.\nAdaptive Insights, Inc.\n10.6x2 \nJanuary 30, 2018\nSAP SE\nCallidus Software Inc.\n8.1x\nJuly 28, 2016\nOracle Corporation\nNetSuite Inc.\n8.6x\nSeptember 18, 2014\nSAP SE\nConcur Technologies, Inc.\n10.2x\n \n1\nBased on revised offer of $63.75 as disclosed in Anaplan, Inc.\u2019s Form 8-K filed on June 6, 2022.\n2\nBased on fiscal year 2017 and 2018 actuals, as well as estimates from JPM Securities and BMO Capital Markets equity research\npublished immediately following the announcement of the transaction.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNone of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the merger. However, the selected transactions were\nchosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered\nsufficiently similar to the merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments\nconcerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that\ncould affect the transaction differently than they would affect the merger.\nBased on the results of this analysis and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected\na transaction multiple reference range for FV / NTM Revenue of 5.1x to 8.8x and applied it to Billtrust\u2019s estimated net\nrevenue for the next twelve months provided by Billtrust\u2019s management to calculate Billtrust\u2019s firm value and imply a\nper share equity value of Billtrust\u2019s common stock. This analysis indicated an implied per share equity value range,\nrounded to the nearest $0.25, of $6.75 to $11.00 for the Class 1 common stock. The range of implied per share equity\nvalues for the Class 1 common stock was compared to (i) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.77 on September 23,\n2022, (ii) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.26 on July 26, 2022, the last full trading day prior to publication of\nnews reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust, and (iii) the amount of the merger consideration of $9.50\nper share.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity\nvalue per share for Billtrust\u2019s common stock.\nThe unlevered free cash flows that Billtrust is expected to generate from June 30, 2022 through December 31,\n2031 were provided to J.P. Morgan in the projections prepared by the management of Billtrust. J.P. Morgan calculated\na range of terminal values of Billtrust by applying perpetual growth rates ranging from 4.0% to 6.0% of the unlevered\nfree cash flow of Billtrust during the terminal year. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values\nwere then discounted to present values as of June 30, 2022 using a range of discount rates from 13.0% to 14.0%,\nwhich was chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon its analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Billtrust.\nIn addition, as directed by management of Billtrust, J.P. Morgan calculated the present value of certain tax\ncredits expected by Billtrust management to be utilized by Billtrust from June 30, 2022 through December 31, 2029,\nwhich were discounted to present values as of June 30, 2022 using the same range of discount rates, 13.0% to 14.0%.\nThe present values were then added together with the present values derived based on the unlevered free cash flows\nand range of terminal values. This was then adjusted for Billtrust\u2019s net debt of ($137,000,000) as of June 30, 2022, and\nthen divided by the number of fully diluted shares of Billtrust\u2019s common stock outstanding at the midpoint, as\nprovided by Billtrust management (based on approximately 164,500,000 shares of common stock outstanding and\nadjusted to reflect the impact of dilutive securities calculated in accordance with the treasury stock method to a total\nfully-diluted share count of approximately 176,300,000 shares), to arrive at a range of implied equity value per share of\nthe Class 1 common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $8.00 to $10.75. The range of implied per share equity\nvalues for the Class 1 common stock was compared to (i) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.77 on September 23,\n2022, (ii) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.26 on July 26, 2022, the last full trading day prior to publication of\nnews reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust, and (iii) the amount of the merger consideration of $9.50\nper share.\nOther Information\nJ.P. Morgan observed certain additional information that was not considered part of J.P. Morgan\u2019s financial\nanalysis with respect to its opinion but was noted for informational purposes, including the following:\n52-Week Historical Trading Range. J.P. Morgan reviewed the 52-week trading range of Billtrust\u2019s end of day\nshare prices for the period ending September 23, 2022, which was $3.95 (an all-time low) to $11.01 (the 52-week high)\nper share of the Class 1 common stock compared to (i) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.77 on September 23,\n2022, (ii) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.26 on July 26, 2022, the last full trading day prior to publication of\nnews reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust, and (iii) the amount of the merger consideration of $9.50\nper share. J.P. Morgan noted that historical trading range analyses were presented merely for reference purposes only\nand were not relied upon for valuation purposes.\nAnalyst Price Targets. J.P. Morgan reviewed the price targets of certain publicly available equity research\nanalyst price targets for the Class 1 common stock available as of September 23, 2022, which provided a reference\nrange of\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n$7.40 to $13.00 per share of the Class 1 common stock and $9.00 per share of Class 1 common stock at the midpoint.\nJ.P. Morgan compared the analyst price targets analysis to (i) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.77 on\nSeptember 23, 2022, (ii) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.26 on July 26, 2022, the last full trading day prior to\npublication of news reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust, and (iii) the amount of the merger\nconsideration of $9.50 per share. J.P. Morgan noted that the analyst price target analyses were presented merely for\nreference purposes only and were not relied upon for valuation purposes.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the\nforegoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing\nsummary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of\nthe processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any\nparticular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of Billtrust.\nThe order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P.\nMorgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors\nconsidered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative),\nconsidered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of the\nfactors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous\nfactors or events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or\nmade by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less\nfavorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be\nappraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the\nselected companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to Billtrust, and none of the selected\ntransactions reviewed was identical to the merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are\npublicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be\nconsidered similar to those of Billtrust. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants,\nsize and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the merger. The analyses\nnecessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational\ncharacteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to Billtrust and\nthe transactions compared to the merger.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the\nvaluation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive\nand control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private\nplacements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise Billtrust with\nrespect to the merger and deliver an opinion to the Billtrust board of directors with respect to the merger on the basis\nof, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its\nfamiliarity with Billtrust and the industries in which it operates.\nFor services rendered in connection with the merger and the delivery of its opinion, Billtrust has agreed to pay\nJ.P. Morgan a fee of approximately $23,100,000, of which $4,000,000 became payable upon the delivery of the opinion\nand the remainder will be payable upon the consummation of the merger. In addition, Billtrust has agreed to reimburse\nJ.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of\ncounsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement. During the\ntwo years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had, and continue to have,\ncommercial, investment banking or similar relationships with Billtrust, EQT AB and certain affiliates of the Parent for\nwhich J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received and will receive customary compensation. Such services during\nsuch period have included acting as dealer for Billtrust in a spot and FX trade that closed in October 2021, as joint\nlead bookrunner on Billtrust\u2019s offering of equity securities that closed in June 2021, as financial and capital markets\nadvisor to Billtrust on a sale transaction that closed in October 2020 and as placement agent to Billtrust on an\noffering of equity securities that closed in October 2020. J.P. Morgan has also acted as joint bookrunner on debt and\nequity securities offerings, provided debt syndication and acted as financial advisor on strategic transactions by\nEQT AB, the Parent and/or certain of their respective\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naffiliates unrelated to the merger. During the two-year period preceding delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees\nrecognized by J.P. Morgan from Billtrust were approximately $14,300,000 and from EQT AB (including through certain\nof its affiliates) were approximately $108,500,000. In addition, J.P. Morgan\u2019s commercial banking affiliate is an agent\nbank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of certain affiliates of EQT AB, for which J.P. Morgan receives\ncustomary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary\nbasis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of Billtrust and EQT AB. In addition, J.P. Morgan\u2019s\ncommercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Billtrust and EQT AB,\nfor which J.P. Morgan receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In the ordinary course of their\nbusinesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments\n(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Billtrust, EQT AB or certain affiliates of the Parent for their\nown accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in\nsuch securities or other financial instruments.",

However, Billtrust is\nincluding in this proxy statement certain financial projections prepared by Billtrust management in 2022, which we\nrefer to as the \u201cManagement Projections,\u201d to reflect Billtrust management\u2019s then-current expectations of Billtrust\u2019s\nfinancial performance for fiscal years 2022 through 2027.\nWe have included a summary of the Management Projections to give stockholders access to certain nonpublic\ninformation prepared by Billtrust management for the Billtrust board of directors in connection with its evaluation of\nthe merger and the merger consideration, which were also provided to J.P. Morgan, who was directed by the Billtrust\nboard of directors to use the Management Projections in their financial analyses with respect to the fairness of the\n$9.50 per share consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger agreement. These Management Projections were also\nmade available to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parent\u2019s request, in connection with their due diligence review of\nBilltrust. The inclusion of the Management Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Billtrust, Parent,\nMerger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives or any other\nrecipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of actual future\nresults.\nThe Management Projections were developed by Billtrust management on a standalone basis without giving\neffect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Furthermore, the Management\nProjections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. The Management\nProjections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Management Projections were based are subjective in\nmany respects. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and reflect numerous estimates\nand assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions,\nchanges to the business, financial condition or results of operations of Billtrust and other matters, including those\ndescribed under \u201cCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d many of which are difficult to predict, subject to\nsignificant economic and competitive uncertainties, are beyond Billtrust\u2019s control and may cause the Management\nProjections or the underlying assumptions not to be realized. Since the Management Projections cover multiple years,\nsuch information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. The Management Projections do\nnot take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared. As a result, there can\nbe no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher\nor lower than projected. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or\ntoward complying with GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines\nestablished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of\nprospective financial information. For example, certain metrics included in the Management Projections are non-\nGAAP measures, and the Management Projections do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP.\nThe prospective financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of,\nBilltrust\u2019s management. Billtrust\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm has not audited, reviewed, examined,\ncompiled, nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information\nand, accordingly, Billtrust\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm does not express an opinion or any other\nform of assurance with respect thereto.\n48TABLE OF CONTENTS\nReaders of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the specific portions of the\nManagement Projections below.

            "text": "Interests of Billtrust\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who\nrecused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) to adopt the merger\nagreement, you should be aware that some of Billtrust\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger\nthat are different from, or in addition to, those of Billtrust\u2019s stockholders generally. The Billtrust board of directors\nwas aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement, in\nreaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and in recommending to our stockholders that the merger\nagreement be approved. These interests are described and quantified below.\nTreatment and Quantification of Equity-Based Awards\nBilltrust\u2019s executive officers currently hold vested and unvested Company Stock Options and/or Company\nRSUs.\nThe merger agreement provides that at or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, the outstanding\nequity awards of Billtrust will be treated as follows:\n\u2022\nCompany Stock Options. As of the record date, there were outstanding Company Stock Options to\npurchase 17,319,238 shares of common stock of Billtrust, of which Company Stock Options to purchase\n9,255,888 shares of common stock of Billtrust were held by Billtrust\u2019s executive officers and non-employee\ndirectors (6,005,888 of which were In-the-Money Options). With respect to each outstanding Company\n \n49TABLE OF CONTENTS\nStock Option, whether vested or unvested, (i) that is an Out-of-the-Money Option, such Company Stock\nOption will terminate and be cancelled immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, without any\nconsideration payable in respect thereof, and will have no further force or effect and (ii) that is an In-the-\nMoney Option, such Company Stock Option will become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the\nextent such Company Stock Option would not otherwise vest) and will terminate and be cancelled\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the merger in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash\ndetermined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the applicable exercise\nprice of such canceled Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Stock\nOption immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.\n\u2022\nCompany RSUs. As of the record date, there were outstanding Company RSUs in respect of 4,658,043\nshares of common stock of Billtrust, of which 1,752,245 Company RSUs were held by Billtrust\u2019s executive\nofficers and non-employee directors. Except as provided below with respect to New RSUs, each Company\nRSU will fully vest and be canceled and converted into the right of the holder to receive an amount in cash\nequal to the product of (i) the merger consideration and (ii) the total number of shares subject to such\nCompany RSU.\n\u2022\nNew RSUs. If closing of the merger does not occur on or before March 31, 2023, Billtrust may grant New\nRSUs to executive officers and non-employee directors in the ordinary course of business (provided that\nany New RSUs awarded to the CEO or any direct report of the CEO or any Executive Vice President or\nSenior Vice President of Billtrust is subject to the consent of Parent, which consent may not be\nunreasonably withheld). Except for grants of New RSUs made to non-employee directors, New RSUs will\nnot accelerate upon closing of the merger and will instead be subject to the RSU Conversion (including,\nwith respect to executive officers, potential payment of any unpaid amount of the as-converted cash award\nupon termination of the executive officer\u2019s employment without cause or for good reason with 24 months\nfollowing the merger).\n\u2022\nESPP. Prior to the effective time of the merger, no new offering period will commence following September\n28, 2022 under the ESPP. Any contributions accumulated under the ESPP pursuant to an offering period in\neffect as of September 28, 2022 will be used to purchase shares on the earlier to the occur of (i) the last day\nof the offering purchase period and (ii) ten calendar days prior to the closing of the transaction. The ESPP\nwill terminate immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.\nAll cash payments in respect of any Billtrust equity award will be paid, without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes, promptly following the effective time of the merger and in no event more than five calendar days\nfollowing the effective time of the merger.\n \n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table provides a summary of the outstanding and unvested In-the-Money Options and Company\nRSUs that were held by Billtrust\u2019s non-employee directors and executive officers as of November 4, 2022. No new\nequity awards were granted to any non-employee director or executive officer in contemplation of the merger. Non-\nemployee directors will continue to receive grants of time-vesting restricted stock units in accordance with the\nBilltrust Director Compensation Policy.

The Employment Agreements provide that each executive officer will be eligible to receive the following\nseverance benefits upon a termination of employment by Billtrust without cause, or a resignation by the executive\nofficer for good reason within twenty-four months following a change in control (the merger will constitute a change\nin control for purposes of the Employment Agreements):\n\u2022\na lump sum payment equal to one times (or two times for Mr. Lane and Ms. Killeen) the sum of the\nexecutive\u2019s then-current annual base salary plus target bonus\u037e\n\u2022\nany earned but unpaid prior year bonus\u037e\n\u2022\na pro-rata portion of his or her then-current target bonus for the year of termination\u037e\n\u2022\nimmediate accelerated vesting of all outstanding equity awards\u037e\n\u2022\na lump sum payment equal to the amount that, on an after-tax basis, equals the total cost of COBRA\ncoverage for the executive for one year minus the premium that the executive would have paid as an active\nemployee over a one-year period (or for Mr. Lane and Ms. Killeen, two times such COBRA payment)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe ability to exercise any outstanding and vested stock options through the 12-month period (or for Mr.\nLane and Ms. Killeen, the 24-month period) following the termination date.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe payments and benefits described above are conditioned upon (i) the executive officer\u2019s execution and\nnonrevocation of a release of claims in favor of Billtrust\u037e and (ii) complying with certain restrictive covenants,\nincluding a noncompetition covenant (for two years post-employment in the case of a termination in connection with\na change in control) and nonsolicitation covenant (for a period of one year post-employment).\nSee \u201cInterests of Billtrust\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d\nbeginning on page 14 of this proxy statement for the estimated amounts that each of Billtrust\u2019s named executive\nofficers would receive under his or her Employment Agreement upon a qualifying termination of employment\nimmediately following the effective time of the merger.\nThe Employment Agreements provide that in the event that any payment or benefit payable to each of the\nexecutive officers in connection with his or her separation with Billtrust would constitute a parachute payment within\nthe meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), then the payments will\nbe reduced to the largest amount which would result in no portion of the payments being subject to the excise tax if\nsuch reduction will provide the executive officer with the best net after-tax result (a \u201cSection 280G cutback\u201d). The\nEmployment Agreements do not provide for a gross-up in the event the executive officer is subject to the \u201cgolden\nparachute\u201d excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, the table below sets forth the\ncompensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger that will or may become payable to each named\nexecutive officer of Billtrust in connection with the merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments\nand benefits described below, see the discussion under the heading \u201cInterests of Billtrust Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger\u201d above, which is incorporated herein to the extent that it applies to the named executive\nofficers.\nFor purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in table below, the following\nassumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe effective time is December 16, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the merger solely for\npurposes of the table below\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe employment of each executive officer of Billtrust will have been terminated by Billtrust without \u201ccause\u201d\nor due to the executive officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined in their\nemployment agreements) immediately following the assumed effective time of December 16, 2022.\nThe amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not\nactually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above or in the footnotes to\nthe table below, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur prior to completion of the merger,\nincluding any equity award grants that may be made after September 28, 2022, such as New RSUs. Some of the\namounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the merger (i.e. without\nregard to whether a termination of employment occurs). In addition, the amounts shown below do not attempt to\nquantify any reduction that may be required as a result of a Section 280G cutback, and therefore, actual payments to\nthe named executive officers may be less than the amounts indicated below.\nBilltrust\u2019s stockholders are being asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that\nwill or may be paid by Billtrust to the named executive officers, as reflected below, that is based on or otherwise\nrelates to the merger (see the section entitled \u201cAdvisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related\nCompensation Arrangements (Proposal 2)\u201d beginning on page 88 of this proxy statement). Because the vote to\napprove such compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Billtrust or Parent. Accordingly, if the\nmerger is approved by Billtrust\u2019s stockholders and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable\nregardless of the outcome of the advisory vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions\napplicable to the vote to approve the merger, which are described in the footnotes to the table and above under the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) - Interests of Billtrust\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 31 of this proxy statement.\n \n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGolden Parachute Compensation Table\n \nCash\n($)(1)\nEquity\n($)(2)\nPerquisites/Benefits\n($)(3)\nTotal\n($)\nFlint Lane, Chief Executive Officer\n1,982,466\n4,032,256\n43,408\n6,058,130\nMark Shifke, Chief Financial Officer\n726,562\n6,855,089\n10,357\n7,592,008\nSteven Pinado, President\n715,137\n3,722,566\n21,711\n4,459,413\nJoseph Eng, Chief Information Officer\n632,986\n5,454,833\n21,726\n6,109,545\nJeanne O\u2019Connor, Chief Talent Officer\n543,973\n2,374,204\n14,743\n2,932,920\n \n(1)\nThis amount represents the \u201cdouble trigger\u201d cash severance payments to which each named executive officer may become\nentitled under his or her employment agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cInterests of\nBilltrust\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Employment Agreements\u201d.

Until so surrendered or\ntransferred, as the case may be, each such certificate or uncertificated share will represent after the effective time of\nthe merger for all purposes only the right to receive such merger consideration. No interest will be paid or will accrue\non the cash payable upon surrender of any such shares.\nIf any portion of the merger consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the\nsurrendered certificate or the transferred uncertificated share is registered, it will be a condition to such payment that\n(i) either such certificate be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such uncertificated share\nbe properly transferred and (ii) the person requesting such payment must pay to the exchange agent any transfer or\nother taxes required as a result of such payment or establish to the satisfaction of the exchange agent and Parent that\nsuch tax has been paid or is not payable.\nAfter the effective time of the merger, there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Billtrust\ncommon stock. If, after the effective time of the merger, certificates representing shares of Billtrust common stock or\nuncertificated shares of Billtrust common stock are presented to the surviving corporation, they will be canceled and\nexchanged for the merger consideration.\nAny portion of the merger consideration made available to the exchange agent for payment to the stockholders\nthat remains unclaimed by the holders of Billtrust common stock that have been converted into the right to receive\nmerger consideration nine months after the effective time of the merger will be returned to Parent, upon demand, and\nany such holder who has not exchanged shares of Billtrust common stock will thereafter look only to Parent for\npayment of the merger consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon and subject to any\nwithholding of taxes required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will not be liable to any holder\nof shares of Billtrust common stock for any amount paid to any governmental authority pursuant to applicable\nabandoned property, escheat or similar applicable law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Billtrust\ncommon stock that have been converted into the right to receive the merger consideration two years after the\neffective time of the merger (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise\nescheat to or become property of any governmental authority) will become, to the extent permitted by applicable law,\nthe property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.\nWithholding",

However that in no event will any of the following be an\nintervening event or be taken into account in determining whether an intervening event has occurred: (1) the receipt,\nexistence or terms of an acquisition proposal\u037e or (2) any change in the trading price or trading volume of the shares or\nBilltrust\u2019s meeting or exceeding any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenues,\nearnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period (provided that any effect underlying such change,\nmeeting or exceedance that is not otherwise excluded by the foregoing clause (2) may be taken into account in\ndetermining whether there has been an intervening event).\nRegulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger\nThe completion of the merger is conditioned on, among other things, certain specified regulatory approvals\nhaving been obtained and remaining in full force and effect (or, in the case of certain specified regulatory approvals\nthat are statutory waiting periods, having expired or been terminated). Under the terms of the merger agreement, each\nof Billtrust and Parent has agreed to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things\nnecessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement as soon as reasonably possible, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any\ngovernment authority or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary filings and other documents and\n(ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations\nrequired to be obtained from any governmental authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or advisable\nto consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In particular, obligations of Parent under the\nmerger agreement include taking, and causing its subsidiaries to take, all actions necessary or appropriate to avoid or\neliminate each and every impediment under any applicable law or otherwise so as to enable the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event prior\nto March 28, 2023), including:\n\u2022\nentering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with or required by any\ngovernmental authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nproposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,\nthe sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, any of its subsidiaries,\nor those of Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries\u037e\n\u2022\nterminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of Parent or its subsidiaries (including\nthose of Billtrust and each of its subsidiaries)\u037e\n\u2022\notherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the closing would limit Parent\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019\n(including Billtrust\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or exercise\nrights of ownership or control with respect to, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of\nParent or its subsidiaries (including Billtrust or any of its Subsidiaries)\u037e\n\u2022\ndefending any action, suit or proceeding (including by appeal if necessary) that challenges any of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement which would otherwise prohibit, materially delay or\nmaterially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nseeking to have lifted, vacated or reversed any stay, injunction, temporary restraining order or other\nrestraint entered by any governmental authority with respect to the merger agreement or the transactions\ncontemplated thereby.\nIf requested by Parent, Billtrust and each of its subsidiaries shall agree to any regulatory concession.

Each of Parent\nand Billtrust will respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from any governmental authority for\nadditional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to use their\nreasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable\nwaiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (I) each of Parent and\nBilltrust may designate any non-public information provided to any governmental entity as restricted to \u201coutside\ncounsel\u201d only and any such information will not be shared with employees, officers, managers or directors or their\nequivalents of the other party without approval of the party providing the non-public information, and (II) materials\nmay be withheld as necessary to address reasonable privilege, sensitive information or confidentiality concerns, or\nredacted to remove references concerning valuation or other competitively sensitive material.\nOn October 13, 2022, both Billtrust and Parent filed a notification of the proposed merger with the FTC and the\nAntitrust Division under the HSR Act.\nOn October 11, 2022, both Billtrust and Parent filed the application of the proposed merger with the Commission\nfor the Protection of Competition in Cyprus and received unconditional clearance on November 8, 2022.\nEach of Parent and Billtrust will (i) promptly notify the other party of any substantive communication to that\nparty from a governmental authority and, subject to applicable law, permit the other party to review and discuss in\nadvance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written\ncommunication to any governmental authority, (ii) promptly furnish the other parties with copies of all\ncorrespondence, filings and written communications between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and such\ngovernmental authority, on the other hand, with respect to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement, (iii) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any\ngovernmental authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning any competition or antitrust\nmatters in connection with the merger agreement or the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such\ngovernmental authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and (iv) furnish the\nother party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the\nsubstance thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any\ngovernmental authority or members or their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to any competition or\nantitrust matters in connection with the merger agreement.\nParent will (i) determine the timing and strategy and be responsible for the content of any substantive oral or\nwritten communications with any applicable governmental authority, and (ii) lead all proceedings and activities, in\neach such case with respect to seeking actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any governmental authority under\nthe HSR Act\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing shall be reasonably designed to obtain all required actions,\nconsents, approvals and waivers of all governmental authorities under the HSR Act at least 10 business days prior to\nthe end date and Parent shall reasonably consult with Billtrust and in good faith consider its views regarding the\nforegoing.\nParent shall cause the sponsors and each of its affiliates to take all actions as are necessary or appropriate to file\nor cause to be filed all documentation, notifications, submissions or filings as described above by the dates or within\nthe periods specified therein.\nLitigation Related to the Merger\nBilltrust is required to promptly advise Parent of any action commenced after the date of the merger agreement\nagainst Billtrust or any of its directors, in their capacity as such, by any stockholder of Billtrust (on their own behalf\nor on behalf of Billtrust) relating to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis regarding any such action.\nBilltrust must (a) give Parent the opportunity to participate, at Parent\u2019s expense and subject to a customary joint\ndefense agreement, in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against Billtrust and/or its officers or\ndirectors, in their capacity as such, relating to the merger or any of the other transactions\n \n69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, (b) provide Parent with the opportunity to consult with Billtrust regarding the\ndefense of any such litigation, which advice Billtrust shall consider in good faith, and (c) not settle any such\nlitigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or\nconditioned).\nEmployee Matters",

corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the\nbusiness of the surviving corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,\ndirectors and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries\nthan the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of the merger agreement.\nPrior to the effective time of the merger, Billtrust will or, if Billtrust is unable to, Parent will cause the surviving\ncorporation as of the effective time of the merger to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable\nextension of the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability coverage of Billtrust\u2019s existing directors\u2019 and

            "text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\nThe following discussion summarizes appraisal rights under the DGCL. The following discussion is not a\ncomplete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262\nof the DGCL, referred to as \u201cSection 262,\u201d which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. The following\nsummary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders\nexercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.\nUnder Section 262, holders of shares of Billtrust common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement and who otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their\nshares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares,\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption and approval at a meeting of\nstockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled\nto appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy\nstatement shall constitute such notice, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.\nANY HOLDER OF BILLTRUST COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, OR\nWHO WISHES TO PRESERVE SUCH HOLDER\u2019S RIGHT TO DO SO, SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE\nFOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANNEX C BECAUSE FAILURE TO TIMELY AND PROPERLY COMPLY WITH\nTHE PROCEDURES SPECIFIED WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF\nTHE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK APPRAISAL OF SHARES OF\nBILLTRUST COMMON STOCK, BILLTRUST BELIEVES THAT, IF A STOCKHOLDER CONSIDERS EXERCISING\nSUCH RIGHTS, SUCH STOCKHOLDER SHOULD SEEK THE ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of Billtrust common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must, before the stockholder vote on\nthe adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting is taken, deliver to Billtrust a written demand for the\nappraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares, and not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A holder of\nBilltrust common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written\ndemand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the merger.\nThe holder must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy that is submitted and does not\ncontain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will\neffectively constitute a waiver of the stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will effectively nullify any previously\ndelivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or\nabstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger\nagreement, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, will in and of\nitself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for\nappraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. The\ndemand must reasonably inform Billtrust of the identity of the holder as well as the intention of the holder to demand\nan appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares held by the holder. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand\nprior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting of stockholders will\nconstitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Billtrust common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares\nregistered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Billtrust common stock should be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the holder of record. The demand should set forth the registered holder\u2019s name as it\nappears on the holder\u2019s stock certificates. A demand for appraisal will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Billtrust of\nthe identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such\nstockholder\u2019s shares. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or\ncustodian, execution of the demand must be made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more\nthan one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy-in-common, the demand must be executed by\n84TABLE OF CONTENTS\nor on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a\ndemand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners\nand expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. If\nthe shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a broker, bank or nominee, the broker, bank or nominee may exercise appraisal\nrights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising the rights with respect to\nthe shares held for other beneficial owners\u037e in such case, however, the written demand should set forth the number of\nshares as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares is expressly mentioned, the demand will be\npresumed to cover all shares of Billtrust common stock held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds\nshares of Billtrust common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities\ndepository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the\ndepository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder. Stockholders who hold their shares\nin brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with\ntheir brokers or other nominees to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by\nsuch a nominee.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be sent or delivered to Billtrust at:\nBTRS Holdings Inc.\n1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 101, \nLawrenceville, New Jersey 08648\nAttention: General Counsel and Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal\nand accept the consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement by delivering to Billtrust, as the surviving\ncorporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand\nmade more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require written approval of Billtrust, as the\nsurviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any\nstockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon\nsuch terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that any stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand\nfor appraisal and accept the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement within 60 days after the\neffective date of the merger. If Billtrust, as the surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a\ndemand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such\nstockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of\nChancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder\nwill be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could\nbe less than, equal to or more than the consideration being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nWithin ten days after the effective date of the merger, Billtrust, as the surviving corporation, must notify each\nholder of Billtrust common stock who has complied with Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption\nof the merger agreement, of the date on which the merger became effective.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger, but not thereafter, Billtrust, as the surviving corporation,\nor any holder of Billtrust common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under\nSection 262, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a\ncopy served upon the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares held by all such holders. Billtrust, as the surviving corporation, is under\nno obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition and holders should not assume that Billtrust as the\nsurviving corporation will file a petition. Accordingly, any holders of Billtrust common stock who desire to have their\nshares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of Billtrust\ncommon stock within the time prescribed in Section 262. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any\nholder of common stock who has complied with the\n85\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrequirements of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from Billtrust as the surviving\ncorporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger\nagreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders\nof such shares. The statement must be mailed within 10 days after a written request therefor has been received by\nBilltrust as the surviving corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for\nappraisal, whichever is later. The foregoing notwithstanding, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of\nBilltrust common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s\nown name, file a petition or request from Billtrust as the surviving corporation the statement described in this\nparagraph. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to appraisal will cease.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of Billtrust common stock and a copy thereof is\nserved upon Billtrust as the surviving corporation, Billtrust as the surviving corporation will then be obligated within\n20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all\nstockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their\nshares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders, the Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a\nhearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become\nentitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded\npayment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon\nof the pendency of the appraisal proceeding\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of\ncommon stock, an appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of\nChancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through this proceeding, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of Billtrust common stock as of the effective time of the\nmerger exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with\ninterest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in\nits discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the\ndate of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date\nof the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will direct the payment of such fair value, with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to the\nstockholders entitled thereto. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation\nmay pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as\nprovided in Section 262 of the DGCL only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and\nthe fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued,\nunless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate\nin the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal\nprior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on\nthe list filed by the surviving corporation pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who has submitted such\nstockholder\u2019s stock certificates to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all\nproceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining\nfair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally\nconsidered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered and that\n\u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware\nSupreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset\nvalue, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained\nas of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the\n86\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmerged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware\nSupreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of\nvalue,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or\nexpectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that \u201celements\nof future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nmerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the\nfairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not\nin any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. No representation is made as to the outcome of the\nappraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. In addition, Delaware courts have decided\nthat the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenter\u2019s exclusive\nremedy. You should be aware that the fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could\nbe greater than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive\nunder the terms of the merger agreement. Billtrust does not anticipate offering greater than the merger\nconsideration to any stockholder who exercises appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of the Billtrust common stock shares is\nless than the merger consideration.\nCosts of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon the surviving corporation and the stockholders\nparticipating in the appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery as the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndeems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may\norder all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,\nincluding reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of\nall shares entitled to appraisal. Any stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will not, after the effective date\nof the merger, be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any other\ndistribution with respect to those shares, other than dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of\nrecord at a date prior to the effective date of the merger\u037e however, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days\nafter the effective date of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers a written withdrawal of his, her or its demand for\nappraisal and an acceptance of the terms of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or\nthereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease and\nthat stockholder will be entitled to receive the merger consideration, without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes, for shares of his, her or its common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.\nIn view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, our stockholders who may wish to dissent from the\nmerger and pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal advisor. To the extent there are any inconsistencies\nbetween the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL shall govern.\n87\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS",

            "text": "ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS\n(PROPOSAL 2)\nAs required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Billtrust is\nrequired to submit a proposal to Billtrust stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the payment by\nBilltrust of certain compensation that will or may be paid by Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on\nor otherwise relates to the merger. This proposal, commonly known as \u201csay-on-golden parachutes,\u201d and which we\nrefer to as the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, gives Billtrust stockholders the\nopportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the named executive officer merger-related compensation.\nThis compensation is summarized in the Golden Parachute Compensation Table under \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)-\nInterests of Billtrust\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d beginning on\npage 52 of this proxy statement, including the footnotes to the table.\nThe Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the\nrollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) encourages you to review carefully the named executive\nofficer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement.\nThe Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the\nrollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) recommends that the stockholders of Billtrust approve the\nfollowing resolution:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the stockholders of Billtrust hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the\nagreements or understandings with and compensation to be paid or become payable by Billtrust to its\nnamed executive officers that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item\n402(t) of Regulation S-K in the Golden Parachute Compensation Table under the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)-Interests of Billtrust\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d, the footnotes to that table and the accompanying narrative\ndisclosure.\u201d\nThe vote on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the named executive officer merger-\nrelated compensation is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.\nAccordingly, you may vote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer\nmerger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-\nrelated compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Billtrust or EQT. Accordingly, if the\nmerger agreement is approved and adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject\nonly to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Billtrust\nstockholders.\nThe above resolution approving the named executive officer merger-related compensation on an advisory basis\nwill require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively at the special meeting.\nThe Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the\nrollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, on a\nnon-binding, advisory basis.\n88TABLE OF CONTENTS\nVOTE ON ADJOURNMENT (PROPOSAL 3)",

            "text": "MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER\nThe following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to \u201cU.S. holders\u201d and \u201cnon-\nU.S. holders\u201d (in each case, as defined below) of Billtrust common stock. This discussion applies only to holders that\nhold their Billtrust common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,\nproperty held for investment). This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to\na holder in light of the holder\u2019s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:\n\u2022\nDealers or brokers in securities or non-U.S. currencies\n\u2022\nTraders subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to Billtrust common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nPersons holding Billtrust common stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion transaction,\nintegrated transaction or constructive sale transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nPersons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\nPartnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes\u037e\n\u2022\nPersons who acquired Billtrust common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise\nas compensation\u037e\n\u2022\nForeign pension funds and their affiliates\u037e\n\u2022\nA \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d, \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d, or corporation that\naccumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax\u037e\n\u2022\nCertain financial institutions (including banks) and insurance companies\u037e\n\u2022\nMutual funds\u037e\n\u2022\nRegulated investment companies\u037e\n\u2022\nReal estate investment trusts\u037e\n\u2022\nCertain former citizens or residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nHolders of Billtrust common stock who exercise dissenters\u2019 rights\u037e\n\u2022\nTax-exempt entities\u037e\n\u2022\nGovernmental agencies or instrumentalities\u037e\n\u2022\nPersons that hold Billtrust common stock through an \u201cindividual retirement account,\u201d \u201cRoth IRA,\u201d or other\ntax-deferred account\u037e\n\u2022\nPersons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being\nrecognized on an applicable financial statement\u037e or\n\u2022\nPersons subject to the United States alternative minimum tax.\nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Billtrust common stock,\nthe U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities\nof the partnership. Partnerships holding Billtrust common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult\ntheir tax advisor as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to them.\nThis discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final and\ntemporary Treasury regulations, all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive\neffect. This discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual\ncircumstances. In addition, tax considerations under state, local and non-U.S. laws are not addressed, nor is potential\napplication of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. Each Billtrust stockholder is strongly urged to\nconsult its tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or other tax\nconsequences to it of the merger.\n92TABLE OF CONTENTS\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Billtrust common stock that\nis:\n\u2022\nA citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nA corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nAn estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\nA trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all the\nsubstantial decisions of which are controlled by one or more U.S. persons or (ii) that has a valid election in\neffect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nThe exchange of Billtrust common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder whose shares of Billtrust common stock are converted into the right to\nreceive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal\nto the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. holder paid\nfor such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Billtrust common stock (i.e.,\nshares of Billtrust common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss generally will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of Billtrust common stock\nexceeds one year at the time of the completion of the merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders\ngenerally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to\nlimitations. Capital gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates also may be subject to a 3.8% federal Medicare\ncontribution tax.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nA \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of Billtrust common stock that is not a U.S. holder or a partnership (or\nan entity treated as a partnership). Payments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Billtrust common\nstock pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nThe gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in\nthe United States (and if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder\u2019s\npermanent establishment or fixed base in the United States)\u037e\n\u2022\nThe non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable\nyear of the exchange of shares of Billtrust common stock for cash pursuant to the merger and certain other\nconditions are met\u037e or\n\u2022\nThe non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than\n5% of the Billtrust common stock at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger, and Billtrust\nis or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or the period that the\nnon-U.S. holder held Billtrust common stock.\nA non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal\nincome tax on any gain realized as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder (unless an applicable income tax treaty\nprovides otherwise). If such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax\nequal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits (or a lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. holder described in\nthe second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on any gain\nrealized, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year, even though\nthe individual is not considered a resident of the United States.If Billtrust is or has been a USRPHC at any time within\nthe shorter of the five-year period preceding the effective time of the merger or a non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period\nwith respect to the applicable shares of Billtrust common stock, the exchange of Billtrust common stock for cash in\nthe merger by such non-U.S. holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S.\nholders, except that the branch profits tax will not apply\u037e provided, that, so long as Billtrust common stock is\nregularly traded on an established securities market for purposes of the USRPHC rules, Billtrust\u2019s treatment as a\nUSRPHC would cause only a\n93\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnon-U.S. holder who holds or held, directly or indirectly under certain ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of\nBilltrust common stock (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or the period that\nthe non-U.S. holder held Billtrust common stock), and is not eligible for a treaty exemption, to be subject to such U.S.\nfederal income tax. Billtrust believes that it is not, and has not been at any time during the five-year period preceding\nthe merger, a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made in exchange for shares of Billtrust common stock generally will be subject to information\nreporting unless the holder is an \u201cexempt recipient\u201d and may also be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24%.\nTo avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and\nreturn Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer\nidentification number provided is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. A non-U.S.\nholder that provides the applicable withholding agent with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or\nW-8ECI, as appropriate, will generally establish an exemption from backup withholding.\nAmounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited\nagainst a holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the relevant information is timely furnished to the Internal\nRevenue Service.\nYou are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your\nparticular circumstances as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or\nunder the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.\n94\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFUTURE BILLTRUST STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS",

This\nprocess, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders\nand cost savings for companies.\nBilltrust and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple\nstockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the\naffected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding\nmaterials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your\nconsent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate\nproxy statement and annual report, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or\nBilltrust if you are a stockholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written request to BTRS Holdings Inc.,\n1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 101, Lawrenceville, New Jersey 08648, Attn: Secretary, or calling 888-666-2594. Stockholders\nwho share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they\nreceive a single copy by notifying Billtrust at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In addition,\nBilltrust will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy\nof the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered\npursuant to a prior request.\n96TABLE OF CONTENTS\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION",

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger,\ndated as of September 28, 2022 (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), among the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary, Bullseye\nMerger Sub, Inc., the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share\nof Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock (i) held in treasury (other than shares of\nCompany Common Stock in an Employee Plan (as defined in the Agreement) of the Company), (ii) owned by the\nAcquiror, Merger Sub and any subsidiary of either the Company or the Acquiror, (iv) held by a holder who has not\nvoted in favor of the Merger (as defined in the Agreement) or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded\nappraisal for such shares in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (v) that are\nRollover Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $9.50 per share of Company\nCommon Stock in cash (the \u201cConsideration\u201d).\nIn connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated September 27, 2022 of the\nAgreement\u037e (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and\nthe industries in which it operates\u037e (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly\navailable financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid\nfor such companies\u037e (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available\ninformation concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market\nprices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e (v) reviewed\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its\nbusiness\u037e and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.\nIn addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial\ncondition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or\nappropriate to our inquiry.\nIn giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that\nwas publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us.\nWe have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our\nengagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent\nverification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor\nhave we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to\nbankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived\ntherefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and\nfinancial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such\nanalyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and that\nthe definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also\nassumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and the\nrelated agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory\nor tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nwith respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents\nand approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the\nCompany or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.\nOur opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information\nmade available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this\nopinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to\nthe fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common\nStock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in\nconnection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of\nthe Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express\nno opinion with respect to the amount or nature of (i) any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of\nany party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons, (ii) any consideration payable in respect to Rollover\nShares (as defined in the Agreement), or (iii) any consideration otherwise payable to any Significant Company\nStockholders (as defined in the Agreement) or any holders of Class 2 common stock, $0.0001 par value, of the\nCompany, in each case, relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the\nTransaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation or consideration.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a\nfee from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed\nTransaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of\nour engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial,\ninvestment banking or similar relationships with the Company, for which we and such affiliates have received\ncustomary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead bookrunner on the\nCompany\u2019s offering of equity securities that closed in June 2021, as financial and capital markets advisor to the\nCompany on a sale transaction that closed in October 2020, as placement agent to the Company on an offering of\nequity securities that closed in October 2020, and as dealer for the Company in a spot and FX trade transaction that\nclosed in October 2021. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have also had\ncommercial, investment banking or similar relationships with certain portfolio companies of the Acquiror, for which\nwe and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included\nproviding debt syndication, equity and debt underwriting and M&A financial advisory services to the Acquiror and\ncertain of its portfolio companies unrelated to the Transaction. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an\nagent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of the Acquiror and certain of its portfolio companies, for\nwhich it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a\nproprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the Company and the Acquiror.

Such statement shall be given to\nthe person within 10 days after such person\u2019s request for such a statement is received by the surviving,\nresulting or converted entity or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for\nappraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.\n(f)\nUpon the filing of any such petition by any person other than the surviving, resulting or converted entity,\nservice of a copy thereof shall be made upon such entity, which shall within 20 days after such service file\nin the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the\nnames and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by such entity. If the petition shall be\nfiled by the surviving, resulting or converted entity, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly\nverified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place\nfixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving, resulting or converted\nentity and to the persons shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. The forms of the notices by\nmail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the\nsurviving, resulting or converted entity.\n(g)\nAt the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the persons who have complied with this section\nand who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the persons who have demanded\nan appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of\nstock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if\nany person fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. If\nimmediately before the merger, consolidation or conversion the shares of the class or series of stock of the\nconstituent or converting corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national\nsecurities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are\notherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1%\nof the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration\nprovided in the merger, consolidation or conversion for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million or\n(3) the merger was approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h)\nAfter the Court determines the persons entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the\nshares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,\nconsolidation or conversion, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the\nfair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the\nCourt in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this\nsubsection, interest from the effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion through the date of\npayment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the\neffective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion and the date of payment of the judgment. At any\ntime before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving, resulting or converted entity may pay\nto each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as\nprovided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair\nvalue of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that\ntime. Upon application by the surviving, resulting or converted entity or by any person entitled to\nparticipate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal\nprior to the final determination of the\nC-4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npersons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving,\nresulting or converted entity pursuant to subsection (f) of this section may participate fully in all\nproceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under this\nsection.\n(i)\nThe Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the\nsurviving, resulting or converted entity to the persons entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each\nsuch person upon such terms and conditions as the Court may order. The Court\u2019s decree may be enforced\nas other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving, resulting or converted\nentity be an entity of this State or of any state.\n(j)\nThe costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court\ndeems equitable in the circumstances.
