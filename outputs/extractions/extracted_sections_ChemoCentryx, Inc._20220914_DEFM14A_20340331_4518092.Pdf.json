If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock on the Merger Proposal will result in a broker non-vote and will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nMerger Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger\nProposal.\n2\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat factors did the Board consider in deciding to enter into the Merger Agreement and recommending the approval of the Merger\nProposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?\nA:\nIn reaching its decision to unanimously approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, and to recommend that our stockholders approve the Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment\nProposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of the proposed\nMerger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, as well as other alternatives. For a more detailed\ndescription of these factors, see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 48 of this\nproxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat is a quorum and how many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?\nA:\nA quorum of stockholders is the presence of stockholders holding the minimum number of shares necessary to transact business at the\nSpecial Meeting. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting,\neither present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present, then under our\namended and restated bylaws, either (i) the holders of voting stock representing a majority of the voting power present at the Special Meeting\nin person or represented by proxy, or (ii) the chairperson of the Special Meeting, may each adjourn the meeting, and the meeting may be held\nas adjourned without further notice other than an announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken of the hour, date and place\nto which the meeting is adjourned and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed\nto be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting.\nIf you submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or submit a ballot in person at the Special\nMeeting (regardless of whether you indicate how you wish to vote), your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock will be counted for purposes\nof determining the presence of a quorum. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee\non how to vote your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock will result in a broker non-vote and such shares will not be counted for purposes\nof determining the presence of a quorum. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will be counted for purposes of\ndetermining the presence of a quorum.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to ChemoCentryx\u2019s\nnamed executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock present in person or by proxy\nat the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Merger Compensation Proposal.\nThe failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote\nin person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet\nname,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares will result in a broker non-vote and will not have\nany effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as if\nyou voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Compensation Proposal.\nBecause the vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either ChemoCentryx or Amgen.\nAccordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the\nconditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders on the Merger\nCompensation Proposal.\n3\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit\nadditional proxies?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock present in person or by proxy\nat the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal.\nThe failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote\nin person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the\nfailure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares will result in a broker non-vote and will not have any effect\non the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as if you voted\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote?\nA:\nThe Board, after considering the various factors described under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 48 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted, and declared\nadvisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) resolved to recommend the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger by ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement be submitted to a vote of ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Compensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the\nAdjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nWe encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, and the documents we\nincorporate by reference and refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you, and then sign, date and\nreturn, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically on the Internet\nor by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the voting\ninstruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Please do not send your stock certificates with your\nproxy card.\nQ:\nHow do I vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with our transfer agent, American\nStock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (referred to as \u201cAST\u201d)), there are four ways to cause your shares to be voted at the Special Meeting:\n\u2022\nby attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot\u037e\n\u2022\nby visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card and granting your proxy\u037e\n\u2022\nby calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card and granting your proxy\u037e or\n\u2022\nby completing, dating, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope.\n4\nTable of Contents\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d each of the Merger\nProposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.\nA control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to grant a proxy to vote your shares of\ncommon stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when granting a proxy electronically over the\nInternet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for granting a proxy to vote your shares, if you grant a proxy\nelectronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as telephone and Internet access charges for which you will be\nresponsible. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to grant a proxy to vote your shares of\ncommon stock.\nIf your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your broker,\nbank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your\nshares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, AST, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the\n\u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf of\nChemoCentryx.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of such shares of ChemoCentryx\ncommon stock and are considered to hold them in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank,\nbroker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have\nthe right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also\ninvited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the\nSpecial Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nQ:\nWill my shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting\npurposes with shares I hold as the stockholder of record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares of ChemoCentryx common stock you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder\nthan any shares of ChemoCentryx common stock you hold as the stockholder of record, any shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held in\n\u201cstreet name\u201d will not be combined for voting purposes with the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock you hold as the stockholder of\nrecord. Similarly, if you own shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of\na trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of ChemoCentryx\ncommon stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held by a corporation or\nbusiness entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held in an individual retirement\naccount must be voted under the rules governing the account.\nQ:\nIf I hold my shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my bank, broker or other nominee vote my shares for me on the\nproposals to be considered at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nNot without your direction. Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock on\nany \u201cnon-routine\u201d proposal if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks,\nbrokers or other nominees have the\n5\nTable of Contents\ndiscretion to vote your shares on routine matters if you fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock with respect to such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers\nand other nominees therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your\nbank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.\nYou should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to instruct them, as applicable, to vote your shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock. Without such instructions, a broker non-vote will result, and your shares will not be voted at the Special\nMeeting. A broker non-vote will have the same effect as if you voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote?\nA:\nThe required vote to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and\noutstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date, not just the shares that are voted at the Special Meeting. If you do not vote in\nperson or by proxy, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or otherwise submitted my vote by proxy?\nA:\nYes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time by:\n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation of your proxy to our Corporate Secretary at ChemoCentryx, Inc., Attention: Corporate\nSecretary, 835 Industrial Road, Suite 600, San Carlos, CA 94070 prior to 11:59 pm Eastern Time on October 17, 2022, the day preceding\nthe Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nsigning a new proxy card with a date later than the date of the previously submitted proxy card relating to the same shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock and returning it to us by mail prior to 11:59 pm Eastern Time on October 17, 2022, the day preceding the\nSpecial Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy by telephone or Internet prior to 11:59 pm Eastern Time on October 17, 2022, the day preceding the Special\nMeeting\u037e or\n\u2022\nattending the Special Meeting and voting in person (simply attending the Special Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked).\nPlease note that if you hold your shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote\nyour shares, the above-described options for revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you should contact your bank,\nbroker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change or revoke your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if\nyou obtain a valid \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person (referred to as a \u201cproxy\u201d) to vote your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock. This\nwritten document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document\nused to designate a proxy to vote your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d The Board has designated each of\nThomas J. Schall, Ph.D. and Susan M. Kanaya, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to grant a proxy to vote your shares, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies,\nwill vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing\n6\nTable of Contents\nthe Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d or to\nabstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented\nby your properly signed proxy will be voted (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Compensation Proposal and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the\nAdjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nMay I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?\nA:\nYes. All stockholders of ChemoCentryx as of the Record Date may attend the Special Meeting and vote in person. Stockholders will need to\npresent proof of ownership of our common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be\nadmitted to the Special Meeting. No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in\nthe Special Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return the\nenclosed proxy or grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or via telephone to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Special\nMeeting. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at\nthe Special Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of ChemoCentryx common stock before consummation of the Merger?\nA:\nIf you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock before consummation of the Merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the\nMerger Consideration in the Merger. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of our common stock through\nconsummation of the Merger.\nThe Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the date the Merger is anticipated to be consummated.\nAccordingly, if you sell or transfer your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless\nspecial arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares\nand each of you notifies ChemoCentryx in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration, if the Merger is consummated, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock, but you\nwill have retained your right to vote these shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of ChemoCentryx\ncommon stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or grant a proxy via the\nInternet or telephone.\nQ:\nHow will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled?\nA:\nIf you hold your shares of common stock in certificated form, you will receive a letter of transmittal shortly after the Merger is consummated\ninstructing you how to surrender your stock certificates, to an exchange agent to be designated by Amgen in order to receive the Merger\nConsideration to which you are entitled. Please do not send in your stock certificates now. If you hold your shares of common stock in book-\nentry form but not through the Depository Trust Company (referred to as \u201cDTC\u201d), you will receive instructions regarding delivery of an\n\u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d with respect to such book-entry shares. If your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your\nbroker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take\nto effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.\n7\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nI do not know where my stock certificate is. How will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares?\nA:\nIf the Merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the consummation of the Merger will include the procedures that\nyou must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your\nstock certificate. You may also be required to post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be consummated?\nA:\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, adoption of the Merger Agreement by the\nholders of a majority of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date,\nthe expiration or termination of the required waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino\nAntitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (referred to as the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), and certain other conditions.\nWe currently anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the fourth quarter of 2022, assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the\nconditions to the Merger. However, it is possible, including as a result of factors outside the control of ChemoCentryx and Amgen, that the\nMerger will be consummated at a later time or not at all.\nQ:\nWhat effects will the Merger have on ChemoCentryx?\nA:\nOur common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act, and is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cCCXI.\u201d As a result of the\nMerger, ChemoCentryx will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. As soon as\nreasonably practicable following the consummation of the Merger, our common stock will cease trading on and be delisted from Nasdaq and\nwill be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and ChemoCentryx will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal?\nA:\nIn accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing you with the opportunity to cast a non-\nbinding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Merger Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Merger Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Merger\nCompensation Proposal is on an advisory basis and will not be binding on ChemoCentryx or Amgen. Further, the underlying compensation\nplans and agreements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.

If the Effective\nTime occurs during the Final Offering Period, (w) the final exercise date under the ESPP will be such date as ChemoCentryx determines in its\nsole discretion (which date must be no later than the date that is five business days prior to the Effective Time), (x) each ESPP participant\u2019s\naccumulated contributions under the ESPP will be used to purchase shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in accordance with the terms of\nthe ESPP as of such final exercise date, (y) the ESPP will terminate effective as of no later than one business day prior to the Closing Date and\n(z) as promptly as practicable following the purchase of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in accordance with the preceding clause (x),\nChemoCentryx will return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such participant\u2019s account after such purchase.

As a holder of ChemoCentryx common stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger if\nyou take certain actions and meet certain conditions. Under the\n10\nTable of Contents\nDGCL, stockholders who do not vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their\nshares of ChemoCentryx common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is consummated, but only if they\ncomply fully with all applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be more than,\nthe same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration. Any stockholder intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other\nthings, submit a written demand for appraisal to ChemoCentryx before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement is taken and must\nnot vote or otherwise submit a proxy to vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Because any proxy that is submitted without an\nindication as to how you wish to vote will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, if you wish to exercise appraisal rights or preserve your right\nto do so, any proxy submitted by you must provide instructions to vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d on the Merger Proposal. Failure to follow\nexactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of the\nDGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your appraisal rights we encourage you to seek the advice of your own\nlegal counsel. See \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 68 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting\ninstruction cards. For example, if your shares of common stock are held in more than one brokerage account or are registered differently, you\nwill receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction card. Please complete, date, sign and return (or grant a proxy to vote via the\nInternet or telephone with respect to) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive to ensure that all of your shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock are voted.\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits us to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary\ninstructions have been received, but only if we provide advance notice and follow certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder\ncontinues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial\nowners of shares of our common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of our common\nstock, you may have already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any\nquestions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement\npromptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple\ncopies.\n1\n1\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWho can help answer my questions?\nA:\nIf you have any more questions concerning the Merger, the Special Meeting or this proxy statement, would like additional copies of this proxy\nstatement or enclosed proxy card, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock,\nplease contact our proxy solicitor or us at the contact information provided below:\n1407 Broadway, 27th Floor\nNew York, New York 10018\nproxy@mackenziepartners.com\nCall Collect: (212) 929-5500\nor\nToll-Free (800) 322-2885\nor\nChemoCentryx, Inc.\n835 Industrial Road, Suite 600\nSan Carlos, CA 94070\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nCall: (650) 210-2900\nIf your broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares, you should also call your broker, bank or other nominee for additional information.\n12\nTable of Contents\nSUMMARY",

Amgen is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human\ntherapeutics.

It was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement. See \u201cThe Companies\u2014Carnation Merger Sub, Inc.\u201d beginning on page 25 of this proxy statement.\nThe Special Meeting (page 26)\nThis proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of proxies to be voted at a Special Meeting of\nChemoCentryx stockholders to be held on October 18, 2022, at the offices of Latham & Watkins LLP, located at 650 Town Center Drive 20th Floor,\nCosta Mesa, CA 92626, at 9:00 a.m., local time.\nAt the Special Meeting, we will ask our stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on (i) the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Merger\nCompensation Proposal and (iii) the Adjournment Proposal.\nThe Merger Proposal (page 104)\nYou will be asked to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides, among other\nthings, that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the\n13Table of Contents\nconditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into ChemoCentryx, with ChemoCentryx surviving the Merger as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Amgen and that, at the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held by ChemoCentryx, Amgen, any subsidiary of ChemoCentryx or of Amgen, or any\nstockholder who has properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive the\nMerger Consideration.\nFollowing the Merger, ChemoCentryx common stock will no longer be publicly listed and traded on Nasdaq, and existing ChemoCentryx\nstockholders will cease to have any ownership interest in ChemoCentryx.\nRecord Date\u037e Shares Entitled to Vote\u037e Quorum (page 26)\nYou are entitled to receive notice and to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as of the close of\nbusiness on the Record Date for the Special Meeting.\nA quorum of stockholders is necessary to transact business at the Special Meeting. The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or by\nproxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, will constitute a\nquorum at the Special Meeting, permitting ChemoCentryx to transact business at the Special Meeting.\nVote Required to Approve the Merger (page 26)\nEach share of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to one vote at\nthe Special Meeting.\nApproval of the Merger Proposal requires the holders of a majority of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and outstanding and\nentitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or an abstention\nfrom voting for the Merger Proposal will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nAs of the Record Date, there were 71,919,705 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.\nRecommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger (page 48)\nThe Board, after considering various factors more fully described under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted, and declared\nadvisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) resolved to recommend the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement and approval of the Merger by ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be\nsubmitted to a vote of ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders. The Board unanimously recommends that ChemoCentryx stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the\nMerger Proposal. In addition, the Board unanimously recommends that ChemoCentryx stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Compensation\nProposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (page 54)\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC (referred to as \u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d) delivered its opinion to the Board that, as of August 3, 2022, and based upon and\nsubject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $52.00 in cash per share of ChemoCentryx common stock to be paid to the holders\n(other than Amgen and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 3, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory\nservices and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs\nopinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other\nmatter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between ChemoCentryx and Goldman Sachs, ChemoCentryx has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a\ntransaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement of ChemoCentryx\u2019s entry into the Merger\nAgreement, to be approximately $40.0 million, payable upon the consummation of the Merger.\nCertain Effects of the Merger on ChemoCentryx (page 35)\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into ChemoCentryx, with\nChemoCentryx surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term \u201csurviving corporation\u201d to\nrefer to ChemoCentryx as the surviving corporation following the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of the capital\nstock of the surviving corporation.\nThe effective time of the Merger (referred to as the \u201cEffective Time\u201d) will occur, if it occurs, upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the\nSecretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later date and time as we and Amgen may agree in writing and specify in such certificate of\nmerger). Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term \u201cClosing Date\u201d to refer to the date on which the closing of the Merger occurs.\nEffect on ChemoCentryx if the Merger is Not Consummated (page 35)\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx common stock\nentitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, ChemoCentryx stockholders will not receive\nany payment for their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, ChemoCentryx will remain a public\ncompany, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file\nperiodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, ChemoCentryx may be required to pay\nAmgen a termination fee, as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee\u037e Certain Expenses\u201d beginning on page 101 of this proxy\nstatement.\nFurthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the Merger not to be\nconsummated, the price of our common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common\nstock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.\nMerger Consideration (page 36)\nIn the Merger, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than Cancelled Shares, Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, each as\ndefined below) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all shares of ChemoCentryx common\nstock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will automatically be cancelled, and will cease to exist, and each holder of a share\nrepresented by a certificate (referred to as \u201cCertificates\u201d) or non-certificated and represented by book-entry (referred to as \u201cBook-Entry Shares\u201d,\nwith those held through the DTC referred to as \u201cDTC Book-Entry Shares\u201d and those not held through DTC are referred to as \u201cNon-DTC Book-Entry\nShares\u201d), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of ChemoCentryx common stock, will cease to have any rights with\nrespect to such shares of ChemoCentryx common stock other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration.\n15\nTable of Contents\nAs described further under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Payment for ChemoCentryx Common Stock\u201d beginning on page 81 of this proxy statement,\non the Closing Date, Amgen will deposit or cause to be deposited cash in an amount necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration with an\nexchange agent designated by Amgen that is reasonably acceptable to ChemoCentryx (referred to as the \u201cexchange agent\u201d) (which amount will not\ninclude any amounts payable to the holders of ChemoCentryx equity awards, which amounts will be paid through the payroll system of Amgen or\nthe surviving corporation). Promptly after consummation of the Merger, holders of Certificates will receive a letter of transmittal instructing them to\nsend their Certificates to the exchange agent in order to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of our common stock represented by such\nCertificates.\nAt the Effective Time, any shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, directly by\nChemoCentryx as treasury stock, directly by Amgen or directly by Merger Sub (referred to as \u201cCancelled Shares\u201d) will automatically be cancelled\nand will cease to exist, and no consideration or payment will be delivered in exchange for such shares. At the Effective Time, any shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock held by any subsidiary of ChemoCentryx or by any subsidiary of Amgen (other than Merger Sub) (referred to as\n\u201cExcluded Shares\u201d) will be converted into such number of shares of the surviving corporation such that each such subsidiary owns the same\npercentage of the outstanding capital stock of the surviving corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned in\nChemoCentryx immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nFurther, any shares of ChemoCentryx common stock owned by stockholders who did not vote in favor of approving the Merger Proposal and\nwho are entitled to demand and have properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with all applicable provisions of\nSection 262 of the DGCL (referred to as \u201cSection 262\u201d) and do not thereafter fail to perfect, withdraw, or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under\nDelaware law (referred to as \u201cDissenting Shares\u201d) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof\nwill be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. See \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 68 of this\nproxy statement.\nAfter the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but\nyou will no longer have any rights as a ChemoCentryx stockholder as a result of the Merger (except that any holder of Dissenting Shares will have\nthose rights granted under Section 262), nor will you be entitled to receive any shares in Amgen or the surviving corporation.\nTreatment of ChemoCentryx Equity Awards (page 79)\nUnder the Merger Agreement, each ChemoCentryx stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time\nwill vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock purchasable upon exercise of such ChemoCentryx stock option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger\nConsideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such ChemoCentryx stock option. Any ChemoCentryx stock options, whether vested or\nunvested, with a per share exercise price equal to or exceeding the Merger Consideration will be cancelled for no consideration as of immediately\nprior to the Effective Time.\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that each RSU that was granted (A) prior to August 3, 2022 or granted after August 3, 2022 and\nspecified in the Disclosure Schedules and/or (B) to a non-employee member of the Board and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective\nTime will vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock subject to such RSU multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration. Each RSU that was granted on or after August 3,\n2022 (other than to a non-employee member of the Board and subject to certain exceptions specified in the Disclosure Schedules) and that is\noutstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into an Amgen Cash Award, representing the right to receive an amount in\ncash equal to the\n16\nTable of Contents\nproduct of (i) the total number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock subject to such RSU multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, which will\nvest and become payable at the same time as such RSU would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms, subject to continued\nemployment.\nThe Merger Agreement further provides that each restricted stock award that was granted prior to August 3, 2022 or to a non-employee\nmember of the Board that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to\nreceive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration.\nAll amounts that become due in respect of outstanding ChemoCentryx equity awards will be less any required withholding taxes and without\ninterest.\nTreatment of the ESPP (page 79)\nThe Merger Agreement provides that ChemoCentryx will take all actions as may be necessary to ensure that, except for the Final Offering\nPeriod, no new offering periods under the ESPP will commence following August 3, 2022, there will be no increase in the amount of payroll\ndeductions or payroll contributions permitted to be made by the participants under the ESPP during the current offering period, except those made in\naccordance with payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of August 3, 2022, and no individuals shall commence participation in the ESPP\nfollowing August 3, 2022. If the Effective Time occurs during the Final Offering Period, (w) the final exercise date under the ESPP will be such date as\nChemoCentryx determines in its sole discretion (which date must be no later than the date that is five business days prior to the Effective Time), (x)\neach ESPP participant\u2019s accumulated contributions under the ESPP will be used to purchase shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in accordance\nwith the terms of the ESPP as of such final exercise date, (y) the ESPP will terminate effective as of no later than one business day prior to the\nClosing Date, and no further rights will be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter, and (z) as promptly as practicable following the purchase\nof shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in accordance with the preceding clause (x), ChemoCentryx will return to each participant the funds, if\nany, that remain in such participant\u2019s account after such purchase. For additional information regarding the ESPP, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014\nTreatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP\u201d beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement.\nInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers of ChemoCentryx in the Merger (page 62)\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, our stockholders should be aware that members of the\nBoard and ChemoCentryx\u2019s executive officers may have various interests in the Merger that may be in addition to, or different from, the interests of\nChemoCentryx stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of these potential interests and considered them at the time they\napproved the Merger Agreement and in making their recommendation that the ChemoCentryx stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These\npotential interests include, but may not be limited to:\n\u2022\neach member of the Board and each of ChemoCentryx\u2019s executive officers holds outstanding ChemoCentryx equity awards. All such\nequity awards outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement will vest at the Effective Time as described under the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP\u201d beginning on page 79\u037e\n\u2022\neach of ChemoCentryx\u2019s executive officers is party to a preexisting employment agreement that provides for severance payments and\nbenefits upon a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control (including the Merger)\u037e\n\u2022\nif an executive officer experiences a qualifying termination prior to payment of fiscal year 2022 bonuses, the executive officer will remain\neligible to receive his or her 2022 bonus (which will be prorated and paid assuming target performance levels if such termination occurs\nprior to December 31, 2022)\u037e and\n17\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\ncontinued indemnification in favor of the current and former directors and officers of ChemoCentryx, as well as certain obligations\nrelated to maintenance of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance.\nFor additional information on the potential interests of members of the Board and ChemoCentryx\u2019s executive officers in the Merger, see \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of ChemoCentryx in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 62.\nFinancing of the Merger (pages 67 and 96)\nThe consummation of the Merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Amgen. However, ChemoCentryx has agreed that it will use\nits reasonable best efforts to provide to Amgen and Merger Sub such cooperation as may be necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably\nrequested by Amgen in connection with Amgen\u2019s arrangement of any third-party debt or equity financing for the purpose of financing the\naggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by the Merger Agreement or otherwise required or undertaken\nin connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions and exceptions set\nforth in the Merger Agreement and as further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Merger \u201d.\nChemoCentryx has also agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices,\ncooperate with Amgen and take all other actions to facilitate the termination at closing of all commitments in respect of ChemoCentryx\u2019s existing\ncredit agreement (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Merger\u201d), the repayment in full on\nthe Closing Date of all obligations in respect of the indebtedness under ChemoCentryx\u2019s existing credit agreement, and the release on the Closing\nDate of any liens securing all such indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith, subject to Amgen providing all funds required to effect all\nsuch repayments (or other arrangements) at the closing.\nAppraisal Rights (page 68)\nIf the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash\nfor the fair value of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of\nthe Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair\nvalue. The \u201cfair value\u201d of your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than,\nor the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as\n\u201cappraisal rights\u201d. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.\nPersons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to\nreceive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of ChemoCentryx\ncommon stock following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should\nrecognize that the fair value of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or\nless than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the\nprocedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the\nwithdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to\nexercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.\n18\nTable of Contents\nA holder of record of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds such shares through the\nEffective Time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii)\nstrictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v)\nin the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the\ndemand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary\nevidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices\ngiven by ChemoCentryx and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal\nRights\u201d), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of ChemoCentryx common stock exclusive of any element of value arising\nfrom the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid\nupon the amount determined to be the fair value.\nA copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal\nrights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who\ndesires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before\nelecting or attempting to exercise such rights. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal\nRights\u201d.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 72)\nThe receipt of cash for shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for such U.S. Holder\u2019s shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in the Merger generally\nwill result in such U.S. Holder\u2019s recognition of gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the cash such U.S. Holder receives\nin the Merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock surrendered in the Merger. A Non-U.S. Holder\ngenerally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-\nU.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States. Stockholders should refer to the discussion under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement and consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state,\nlocal or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or other tax laws.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 75)\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be consummated until the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the\nHSR Act has expired or been terminated. ChemoCentryx and Amgen filed their respective HSR Act notifications on August 17, 2022. We currently\ndo not expect that any other clearance, approval or consent would be required under any other applicable antitrust law in connection with the\nMerger.\nLitigation Related to the Merger (page 76)\nSince the announcement of the entry into the Merger Agreement, a lawsuit entitled Meinking v. ChemoCentryx, Inc., was filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California, with ChemoCentryx and the members of the Board named as defendants.\n19\nTable of Contents\nFor information regarding the pending litigation, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Litigation Related to the Merger\u201d beginning on\npage 76.\nNo Solicitation\u037e Acquisition Proposals (page 89)\nFrom August 3, 2022, until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Effective Time,\nneither ChemoCentryx nor any of its subsidiaries can, and each of them must cause their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly:\n\u2022\nsolicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of, or that would reasonably be expected to result\nin the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined and described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and\nAgreements\u2014No Solicitation\u037e ChemoCentryx Acquisition Proposals\u037e Adverse Recommendation Change\u201d beginning on page 89 of\nthis proxy statement)\u037e\n\u2022\nenter into or participate in any discussions (except solely to notify a person that makes any inquiry or offer with respect to an\nAcquisition Proposal of the existence of the non-solicitation provisions contained in the Merger Agreement) or negotiations with,\nfurnish any information relating to ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books\nor records of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any third party in connection with, or\nfor the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating, an Acquisition Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\neffect an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined and described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and\nAgreements\u2014No Solicitation\u037e ChemoCentryx Acquisition Proposals\u037e Adverse Recommendation Change\u201d beginning on page 89 of\nthis proxy statement)\u037e or\n\u2022\nauthorize or enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option\nagreement or other similar instrument or agreement, whether written or oral, binding or non-binding, relating to an Acquisition Proposal.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if before obtaining the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx\ncommon stock entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date in favor of the Merger Proposal (which is referred to as the \u201cChemoCentryx\nStockholder Approval\u201d), ChemoCentryx receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of ChemoCentryx\u2019s\ncovenants and agreements related to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement and the Board determines in good faith, after\nconsultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a\nSuperior Proposal (as defined and described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014No Solicitation\u037e ChemoCentryx\nAcquisition Proposals\u037e Adverse Recommendation Change\u201d beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement), ChemoCentryx may, subject to certain\nrequirements:\n\u2022\nengage in negotiations or discussions with such third party regarding such Acquisition Proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\nfurnish non-public information to such third party so long as such information was or is concurrently made available to Amgen and\nsuch person enters into a confidentiality agreement with ChemoCentryx on terms specified in the Merger Agreement.

ChemoCentryx\nAcquisition Proposals\u037e Adverse Recommendation Change\u201d beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement.\n20\nTable of Contents\nBefore obtaining the ChemoCentryx Stockholder Approval, the Board, in response to (i) ChemoCentryx\u2019s receipt of a bona fide Acquisition\nProposal that (A) did not result from a breach of ChemoCentryx\u2019s covenants and agreements related to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger\nAgreement and (B) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a\nSuperior Proposal or (ii) an Intervening Event (as defined and described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014No\nSolicitation\u037e ChemoCentryx Acquisition Proposals\u037e Adverse Recommendation Change\u201d beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement), may effect\nan Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of clause (i) above and subject to compliance with certain procedures specified in the Merger\nAgreement, authorize and cause ChemoCentryx to terminate the Merger Agreement and, concurrently with such termination, enter into a\ndefinitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.\nHowever, the Board is not permitted to take the actions described in the paragraph immediately above unless, among other things, (i)

counsel, that, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the applicable Acquisition Proposal\ncontinues to constitute a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or, if applicable, terminate the Merger\nAgreement and enter into a definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal, would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary\nduties of the Board under applicable law (all as described in more detail under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014No\nSolicitation\u037e ChemoCentryx Acquisition

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Board, together with members of senior management of ChemoCentryx, regularly reviews and assesses the performance, future growth\nprospects, business plans and overall strategic direction of ChemoCentryx, and considers a variety of strategic alternatives that may be available to\nChemoCentryx, including continuing to pursue its strategy as a standalone company or pursuing potential strategic or financing transactions with third\nparties, in each case with the goal of maximizing stockholder value.\nOn March 3, 2020, the Board held a regularly-scheduled telephonic meeting at which members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and\nrepresentatives of Latham & Watkins LLP (referred to as \u201cLatham & Watkins\u201d), counsel to ChemoCentryx, were also present. At the meeting, members of\nsenior management of ChemoCentryx provided a business update to the Board, including, among other matters, an update with respect to\nChemoCentryx\u2019s anticipated NDA filing for avacopan for the treatment of ANCA vasculitis and an update with respect to certain of ChemoCentryx\u2019s\ncommercial partnerships and marketing efforts. At an executive session of the meeting, Dr. Thomas Schall, Chief Executive Officer of ChemoCentryx, led a\ndiscussion regarding ChemoCentryx\u2019s achievement of corporate goals during the 2019 year, as well as ChemoCentryx\u2019s pipeline and preparation for\ncommercialization. During such executive session, Dr. Schall and members of the Board also discussed whether ChemoCentryx should consider the\npossibility of a strategic partnership transaction, equity financing or a broader strategic transaction at such time. Following discussion, the Board\ndetermined that members of senior management and the Board should continue to evaluate alternatives that may be available to ChemoCentryx, and that\nit would be appropriate for members of senior management to participate in introductory calls with investment bankers that may assist with\nChemoCentryx\u2019s consideration of a potential strategic transaction.\nOn April 3, 2020, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,\nrepresentatives of Latham & Watkins and, for a portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs. At the meeting, representatives of Goldman\nSachs discussed the biopharmaceutical market generally, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and trends in biopharmaceutical strategic\ntransactions. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reviewed certain preliminary illustrative financial analyses of ChemoCentryx on a standalone basis\nand the assumptions underlying such\n36Table of Contents\npreliminary analyses and noted that the same were illustrative analyses, reflected no risk adjustment and were subject to change. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs then discussed a potential strategic transaction process, including an illustrative timeline for such a process, and certain\nbiopharmaceutical companies that might have interest in considering a potential strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx. The Board then further\ndiscussed, without representatives of Goldman Sachs present, ChemoCentryx\u2019s engagement of Goldman Sachs to serve as ChemoCentryx\u2019s financial\nadvisor with respect to a potential strategic transaction process, and the merits of initiating a strategic transaction process at such time. The Board\u2019s\ndiscussion included weighing the potential benefits of outreach to potential counterparties against the potential risks of such a process, as well as\ndiscussion of the parties identified by Goldman Sachs as parties that may be interested in considering such a strategic transaction involving\nChemoCentryx. Representatives of Latham & Watkins then led a discussion with respect to maintaining confidentiality during a strategic transaction\nprocess and the obligations and best practices in conducting such a process. Following discussion, the Board authorized ChemoCentryx\u2019s engagement\nof Goldman Sachs as ChemoCentryx\u2019s financial advisor and authorized senior management of ChemoCentryx to work with Goldman Sachs to initiate a\nprocess to explore a potential strategic transaction involving ChemoCentryx. The closing price per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock on April 3,\n2020 was $38.96.\nIn accordance with the Board\u2019s direction, during the period between April 3, 2020 and June 1, 2020, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted 13\npotential strategic transaction counterparties, including Amgen, to gauge their interest in a potential strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx.

Dr. Schall did not express his views with respect to a\nvaluation of ChemoCentryx, but noted that ChemoCentryx would evaluate any proposal for an acquisition of ChemoCentryx by Amgen and that, in\naddition to TAVNEOS, ChemoCentryx\u2019s pipeline, including its novel, orally-administered PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559, would need to be\nconsidered. The closing price per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock on February 25, 2022 was $30.63.\nOn February 27, 2022, Mr. Bradway contacted Dr. Schall by telephone and again expressed Amgen\u2019s potential interest in considering an acquisition\nof ChemoCentryx.\nOn March 1, 2022, following ChemoCentryx\u2019s Q4 2021 earnings call, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone conversation.

Mr. Bradway indicated that, following further discussion\nbetween Amgen\u2019s representatives and Amgen\u2019s financial advisor, PJT Partners LP (referred to as \u201cPJT\u201d), Mr. Bradway expected to deliver to Dr. Schall a\npreliminary indication of interest for Amgen\u2019s acquisition of ChemoCentryx and reiterated the common interests and common goals of ChemoCentryx and\nAmgen.\nOn March 3, 2022, Mr. Bradway telephoned Dr. Schall and indicated that Amgen intended to deliver a preliminary indication of interest to acquire\nChemoCentryx at a per share cash purchase price of $42.50. Dr. Schall indicated to Mr. Bradway that he would discuss the proposal with, and could not\ncomment on behalf of, the Board, and that his personal view was that the proposed purchase price would not be sufficient to generate interest from the\nBoard in pursuing a potential transaction.\nLater on March 3, 2022, Ms. Khosla, on behalf of Amgen, delivered to Dr. Schall a written non-binding indication of interest in which Amgen\nproposed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx for a per share cash purchase price of $42.50, subject to, among other things,\ncustomary due diligence and approval by Amgen\u2019s board of directors.

Following a discussion of various alternative responses to the non-binding indication of interest\nreceived from Amgen, the Board determined that the valuation proposed by the non-binding indication of interest undervalued ChemoCentryx and, as\nsuch, that ChemoCentryx should decline Amgen\u2019s offer and should not provide diligence information to, or engage in valuation discussions with, Amgen\nunless Amgen meaningfully increased the value of its proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx.\nLater on March 7, 2022, as directed by the Board, Dr. Schall telephoned Mr. Bradway and declined Amgen\u2019s offer to acquire ChemoCentryx\npursuant to the March 3, 2022 non-binding indication of interest.\nOn March 18, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,\nrepresentatives of Latham & Watkins and, for a portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs.

On the call, the Goldman\nSachs representative, based on discussions with and guidance from ChemoCentryx, conveyed that a proposal by Amgen would likely need to be in the\n$50s (on a price per share basis) in order for the Board to consider engagement in further discussions by ChemoCentryx with Amgen regarding a potential\nbusiness combination.\nOn June 4, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone call on which they discussed the May 20, 2022 phone call between\nrepresentatives of PJT and representatives of Goldman Sachs.

On that call, Mr. Bradway reiterated Amgen\u2019s interest in pursuing an acquisition of\nChemoCentryx and indicated that Amgen would increase its proposed purchase price to $51.00 per share.

The Board also discussed whether any other biopharmaceutical\ncompanies might have interest in a potential strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx, including certain potential counterparties identified by Goldman\nSachs and previously discussed with the Board. The Board\u2019s discussion included weighing the potential benefits of outreach to other potential\ncounterparties against the potential risks, including the risk of leaks inherent in such a process and the potential impact on ChemoCentryx\u2019s business of\nsuch leaks.

On that call, Party E\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer indicated that Party E was interested in exploring a potential business combination with ChemoCentryx and that Party E would be\ndelivering to ChemoCentryx a written indication of interest for the acquisition of ChemoCentryx for a per share cash purchase price equal to $36.00,\nsubject to customary due diligence and approval by Party E\u2019s board of directors. Dr. Schall indicated that he would need to discuss Party E\u2019s proposal\nwith, and could not\n42\nTable of Contents\ncomment on behalf of, the Board, and that his personal view was that the proposed $36.00 per share purchase price would not be sufficient to generate\ninterest from the Board in pursuing a potential transaction. Later in the day on July 13, 2022, representatives of Party E delivered to Dr. Schall a written\nnon-binding indication of interest for Party E\u2019s acquisition of ChemoCentryx for a cash purchase price of $36.00 per share, which non-binding indication\nof interest included a financing commitment letter from Party E\u2019s financial advisor.

Following discussion, the Board determined that, in light of the low valuation ascribed to ChemoCentryx in Party E\u2019s July 13,\n2022 indication of interest, management of ChemoCentryx should decline further discussions with Party E with respect to a potential business\ncombination unless and until Party E significantly increased the purchase price of its proposal.\nOn July 14, 2022, as directed by the Board, Dr. Schall contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Party E and informed him that the Board had\ndetermined that the value ascribed to ChemoCentryx in Party E\u2019s July 13, 2022 indication of interest was not at a price that warranted further discussions\nwith respect to a potential business combination unless and until Party E significantly increased the purchase price of its proposal.\nOn July 19, 2022, representatives of Party E delivered to Dr. Schall a revised non-binding written indication of interest pursuant to which Party E\nproposed an acquisition of ChemoCentryx at a per share price equal to $40.00.

The Board, representatives\nof Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins then discussed certain other biopharmaceutical companies who would be considered most\nlikely to have interest in acquiring ChemoCentryx and who would be the most likely to be capable of completing an acquisition of ChemoCentryx.\nFollowing such discussion, the Board directed representatives of Goldman Sachs to contact four other global biopharmaceutical companies (including\nParty A, Party C, Party D, and one other biopharmaceutical company referred to as \u201cParty F\u201d) with respect to their potential interest in an acquisition of\nChemoCentryx.\nBetween July 21, 2022, and July 26, 2022, as directed by the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of each of Party A,\nParty C, Party D and Party F to inquire as to whether such parties would be interested in a potential sale transaction involving ChemoCentryx. Between\nJuly 21, 2022, and July 28, 2022, representatives of Party C, Party D and Party F indicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs, without providing a\nspecific reason, that each such party was not interested in engaging with ChemoCentryx at such time with respect to a potential sale transaction. Also\nduring the same period, Representatives of Party A indicated that Party A would need to discuss internally to determine Party A\u2019s level of interest and\nwhether Party A would like to proceed with discussions regarding a potential transaction.\nOn July 21, 2022, as directed by the Board, Dr. Schall participated in a telephone call with the Chief Executive Officer of Party E. On that call, Dr.\nSchall informed the Chief Executive Officer of Party E that the Board had determined that the value ascribed to ChemoCentryx in Party E\u2019s July 19, 2022\nindication of interest was inadequate to engage in further discussions.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOn July 22, 2022, representatives of Party E participated in a telephone call with representatives of Goldman Sachs and indicated that Party E felt\nthat an offer of $40.00 per share was substantial and should warrant engagement. Consistent with the Board\u2019s direction, representatives of Goldman\nSachs indicated to the representatives of Party E that ChemoCentryx would consider a potential strategic transaction with Party E, but that the valuation\nascribed to ChemoCentryx in Party E\u2019s July 19, 2022 indication of interest would need to be increased first. Based on direction from the Board,\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs suggested that in order to warrant engagement with ChemoCentryx, a proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx should reflect\na per share purchase price in the $50s. Representatives of Party E suggested that Party E was unlikely to reach a per share purchase price consistent with\nthat guidance and that Party E may need to move in a different direction.\nOn July 26, 2022, the Board held a regularly-scheduled meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Latham & Watkins, members of\nsenior management of ChemoCentryx and, for a portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs. At the meeting, members of senior\nmanagement of ChemoCentryx provided a business update to the Board, including, among other matters, certain personnel changes, a commercial update\nwith respect to, among other matters, the TAVNEOS launch, a clinical development update and a legal update. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then\nprovided an update with respect to its outreach to Party A, Party C, Party D and Party F, the July 22, 2022 discussion between representatives of Goldman\nSachs and representatives of Party E, and the status of discussions with Amgen.\nAlso on July 26, 2022, a Goldman Sachs representative inquired with a representative of Party A as to whether Party A might be interested in\npotentially pursuing a business combination with ChemoCentryx. The Party A representative indicated that Party A would likely be interested.\nAlso on July 26, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone call on which Dr. Schall provided an update with respect to matters\nbeing discussed by representatives of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Amgen and indicated to Mr. Bradway that significant progress had been\nmade with respect to such matters. Mr. Bradway acknowledged the progress made in Amgen\u2019s diligence investigation of ChemoCentryx.\nOn the evening of July 26, 2022, representatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to Amgen (referred to as \u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d), provided\nan initial draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Latham & Watkins. The initial draft of the Merger Agreement, among other things, provided\nfor a one-step merger transaction and a termination fee of 4.0% of the aggregate equity value of the transaction payable in certain circumstances.\nOn July 27, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone call on which Mr. Bradway indicated that, subject to continued progress\nwith respect to Amgen\u2019s diligence investigation of ChemoCentryx, and subject to approval by Amgen\u2019s board of directors, Amgen was prepared to\nincrease its per share offer price for an acquisition of ChemoCentryx to $52.00.\nAlso on July 27, 2022, Dr. Schall and the Chief Executive Officer of Party E participated in a telephonic conversation. The Chief Executive Officer of\nParty E stated that Party E had significant interest in engaging in a potential transaction with ChemoCentryx and felt that its substantial improvement to\nits July 13, 2022 indication of interest should warrant engagement and access to diligence. The Chief Executive Officer of Party E also stated that he\nbelieved certain stockholders of ChemoCentryx would find an offer of $40.00 per share compelling. The Chief Executive Officer of Party E suggested Party\nE\u2019s willingness and preference to engage privately with ChemoCentryx but noted that he was prepared to present Party E\u2019s proposal publicly to\nChemoCentryx stockholders. Consistent with prior direction from the Board, Dr. Schall reiterated the message that the value ascribed to ChemoCentryx in\nParty E\u2019s July 19, 2022 indication of interest was not at a price that warranted further discussions with respect to a potential business combination unless\nand until Party E significantly increased the purchase price of its proposal.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOn July 28, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of\nLatham & Watkins. At the meeting, Dr. Schall provided the Board an update on recent diligence discussions with Amgen and Dr. Schall\u2019s recent\ndiscussion with Party E\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided an update on discussions with Party A\u2019s\nrepresentatives. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided an update on Party C, Party D, and Party F, noting to the Board that each such party\nhad decided not to engage. Following discussion, the Board directed members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Goldman\nSachs to continue engaging with Party E on a limited basis, to convey to representatives of Party E the need for Party E to increase its offer price prior to\nChemoCentryx providing Party E with due diligence information and to convey to representatives of Party E that for a proposal by Party E to acquire\nChemoCentryx to be compelling to the Board such proposal would need to reflect a per share purchase price in the $50s. The Board further directed\nmembers of senior management of ChemoCentryx, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins to continue engaging with\nAmgen and its representatives with respect to negotiation of the draft Merger Agreement, and to engage with Party A in parallel including by providing\nguidance on valuation and timing. The Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins then discussed certain other\nbiopharmaceutical companies who would be considered most likely to have interest in acquiring ChemoCentryx and who would be most likely to be able\nto complete an acquisition of ChemoCentryx. Following such discussion, the Board directed representatives of Goldman Sachs to contact one additional\nbiopharmaceutical company (referred to as \u201cParty G\u201d) to gauge its potential interest in an acquisition of ChemoCentryx. Party G was contacted by\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs in May 2020 as part of ChemoCentryx\u2019s 2020 strategic transaction process, but did not enter into a non-disclosure\nagreement with ChemoCentryx during such time or otherwise indicate interest in a potential acquisition of ChemoCentryx during such process.\nLater on July 28, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided a representative of Party A with guidance that a transaction was likely to happen\nin the near-term, and that it was important for Party A to provide a proposal quickly. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also indicated that, in order to be\ncompetitive, Party A would need to be able to support a proposal in the $50s (on a price per share basis). The Party A representative indicated that Party\nA was prepared to move in line with the timing guidance and could see a path to a proposal price in line with the price guidance provided. Between July\n28, 2022 and July 29, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, representatives of Latham & Watkins, and representatives of counsel for Party A\nnegotiated the terms of a non-disclosure agreement. On July 29, 2022, ChemoCentryx and Party A executed a non-disclosure agreement.\nLater on July 28, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Party G discussed whether Party G would be interested in a\npotential transaction involving ChemoCentryx. The representatives of Party G indicated that they would need to discuss internally and would revert.\nParty G never followed up with representatives of Goldman Sachs.\nAlso on July 28, 2022, representatives of Party E contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs and indicated that Party E remained interested in a\npotential strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx. Consistent with the Board\u2019s direction, representatives of Goldman Sachs reiterated their previous\nguidance that a compelling proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx would reflect a per share purchase price in the $50s. Representatives of Party E indicated\nthat Party E was prepared to submit a revised indication of interest, but that Party E was unlikely to reach a per share purchase price level consistent with\nthat guidance. Representatives of Party E also suggested that, while Party E would like to pursue a potential transaction privately, Party E would be\nwilling to explore other paths, including potentially reaching out to ChemoCentryx stockholders directly.\nOn July 29, 2022, ChemoCentryx granted representatives of Party A access to an electronic data room containing due diligence information\nregarding ChemoCentryx.\nAlso on July 29, 2022, representatives of Party E delivered to Dr. Schall a further revised non-binding written indication of interest pursuant to\nwhich Party E proposed an acquisition of ChemoCentryx at a per share price equal to $44.00. The closing price per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common\nstock on July 29, 2022 was $23.62.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOn July 30, 2022, representatives of Latham & Watkins sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton.\nThereafter, during the period from July 30, 2022 through the early afternoon of August 3, 2022, representatives of ChemoCentryx and Amgen and their\nrespective legal advisors negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement. Key terms of the Merger Agreement negotiated between the parties included: (1)\nthe terms of the \u201cno-shop\u201d restrictions and the circumstances in which the Board could change its recommendation to ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders or in\nwhich ChemoCentryx could negotiate or accept an alternative acquisition transaction, including the circumstances in which the Merger Agreement could\nbe terminated by ChemoCentryx\u037e (2) the amount of the termination fee and the circumstances in which it would be payable by ChemoCentryx\u037e (3) the\ndefinition of \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect\u201d with respect to ChemoCentryx\u037e (4) the conditions to each party\u2019s obligation to complete the Merger\u037e (5) the\nparties\u2019 commitments in connection with obtaining required regulatory approvals and the extent to which the parties would be obligated to agree to\nremedies in connection with obtaining such regulatory approvals\u037e (6) the interim operating covenants applicable to ChemoCentryx prior to the closing of\nthe Merger and related exceptions\u037e and (7) ChemoCentryx\u2019s other representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement. The Board was\nkept apprised of these discussions.\nOn July 31, 2022, representatives of Latham & Watkins delivered an initial draft merger agreement to representatives of counsel for Party A. On the\nsame date, members of senior management of ChemoCentryx, together with representatives of Goldman Sachs, delivered a management presentation to\nrepresentatives of Party A via videoconference.\nOn August 1, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, Dr. Schall provided the Board an update on his recent\ndiscussions with Mr. Bradway, including his July 27, 2022 phone call on which Mr. Bradway indicated that Amgen would be prepared to increase its per\nshare proposal from $51.00 to $52.00. Dr. Schall also provided the Board an update with respect to Party E, including a summary of the further revised\nnon-binding indication of interest received from Party E on July 29, 2022. Members of senior management of ChemoCentryx, together with representatives\nof Latham & Watkins, then provided the Board with an update on the negotiation of the Merger Agreement and recent discussions held between\nrepresentatives of ChemoCentryx and Amgen and their respective legal advisors with respect to certain material terms of the Merger Agreement.\nRepresentatives of Latham & Watkins then reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties in the context of a sale of ChemoCentryx for\ncash consideration. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then updated the Board on its outreach to Party A, Party C, Party D, Party F and Party G,\nincluding that a non-disclosure agreement had been executed by ChemoCentryx and Party A and a draft merger agreement had been provided to Party A,\nand that each other potential acquirer contacted had either expressly indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a transaction at this time or, in the\ncase of Party G, had not followed up with Goldman Sachs following Goldman Sachs\u2019s initial outreach. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided an\nupdate on their discussions with representatives of Party E and with respect to the revised non-binding indication of interest received from Party E on\nJuly 29, 2022. Following discussion, the Board instructed senior management of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Latham & Watkins to continue\nnegotiation of the Merger Agreement with representatives of Amgen and Wachtell Lipton, and to continue engagement with Party A and Party E. The\nBoard also directed senior management of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Goldman Sachs to continue seeking a definitive proposal on valuation\nfrom Party A and to continue expressing to representatives of Amgen the Board\u2019s expectation that Amgen would continue to evaluate the valuation of\nChemoCentryx during the course of its diligence investigation and negotiation of the Merger Agreement.\nLater on August 1, 2022, representatives of Party E participated in a telephone call with representatives of Goldman Sachs. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs stated they were prepared to share a non-disclosure agreement with Party E and willing to share diligence information regarding\nChemoCentryx if Party E believed that it could likely put forth a proposal in line with the previous guidance in the $50s (on a price per share basis).\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed that timing was of the essence and encouraged Party E to move quickly and execute the non-\ndisclosure agreement in order to receive diligence information.\n46\nTable of Contents\nSubsequently, on August 1, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided representatives of Party E with a non-disclosure agreement. During\nthe period of August 2, 2022 to August 3, 2022, representatives of Latham & Watkins negotiated the terms of such non-disclosure agreement with\nrepresentatives of Party E and its legal counsel. As of the evening on August 3, 2022, the final terms of the non-disclosure agreement for Party E were not\nfinalized. The non-disclosure agreement was never executed by Party E.\nAlso on August 1, 2022, senior management of ChemoCentryx and Party A, together with representatives of Latham & Watkins and counsel for\nParty A, participated in videoconferences to discuss intellectual property and tax due diligence matters.\nOn the morning of August 2, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone call. On that call, Dr. Schall emphasized the significant\nprogress that had been made with respect to ChemoCentryx\u2019s responses to Amgen\u2019s diligence inquiries and negotiation of the Merger Agreement. Dr.\nSchall also noted that the Board had authorized management\u2019s engagement with Amgen and access to diligence materials on the basis that Amgen would\nuse the same to improve upon its valuation proposal. Dr. Schall noted that, based on discussions with the Board, a per share purchase price of $54.50\nwould generate interest from the Board in approving a potential transaction. Mr. Bradway indicated that he did not think there would be any additional\nroom above the $52.00 per share proposal previously communicated, but that he would consider the matter further and revert.\nAlso on the morning on August 2, 2022, representatives of Party A communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that, after internal review,\nParty A would not be interested in consummating a transaction at the valuation being considered by ChemoCentryx.\nIn the early afternoon on August 2, 2022, Mr. Bradway telephoned Dr. Schall and indicated that Amgen would not raise its per share purchase price\nabove $52.00 per share.\nLater in the afternoon on August 2, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management\nof ChemoCentryx, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, Dr. Schall updated the Board with respect\nto his conversation with Mr. Bradway and Amgen\u2019s unwillingness to increase its offer price above the $52.00 per share proposal previously\ncommunicated. Dr. Schall also updated the Board with respect to Party A\u2019s inability to consummate a transaction at the valuation being contemplated, as\nwell as Party E\u2019s request for diligence information. Dr. Schall and representatives of Goldman Sachs noted that Party E\u2019s request for diligence information\ndid not include a revised valuation proposal from Party E, and the Board discussed Party E\u2019s previous per share proposal of $44.00 per share and Party\nE\u2019s ability to finance a transaction at a higher valuation based on publicly available information. Members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,\ntogether with representatives of Latham & Watkins, provided an update on the transaction process and an update regarding the negotiation of the\nMerger Agreement, including a summary of the terms of the draft Merger Agreement that had been negotiated with representatives of Amgen and\nWachtell Lipton and material open items as of the time of the meeting. Representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed with the members of the Board\ntheir fiduciary duties in the context of a sale of ChemoCentryx for cash consideration. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed Goldman Sachs\u2019s\npreliminary financial analyses with respect to the Merger. The Board also reviewed with members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs the results of ChemoCentryx\u2019s outreach process to solicit interest from alternative potential acquirors\u037e it was the\nconsensus of the Board that re-engagement with the other potential acquirors contacted during the process or outreach to additional potential acquirors\nwas not likely to lead to an acquisition proposal superior to the Merger, could jeopardize the successful entry into an acquisition transaction with Amgen\nat the per share price of $52.00 and could cause significant disruption and risk to ChemoCentryx. The Board noted the relationship disclosures provided\nby Goldman Sachs regarding its relationship with Amgen\u037e the Board did not identify any concerns with these disclosures. The Board then directed senior\nmanagement of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Latham & Watkins to continue the negotiation of the Merger Agreement.\n47\nTable of Contents\nDuring the evening of August 2, 2022 and continuing through the early afternoon of August 3, 2022, members of senior management of\nChemoCentryx and representatives of Latham & Watkins and Wachtell Lipton finalized the negotiation of all of the open issues in the Merger Agreement.\nAs part of this resolution, and among other matters, the parties agreed that the termination fee would be equal to approximately $119.3 million.\nOn August 3, 2022, after market close, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management of\nChemoCentryx, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins. Members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and\nrepresentatives of Latham & Watkins updated the Board on the negotiation of the Merger Agreement and disclosure schedules. Representatives of\nLatham & Watkins reviewed modifications to the terms of the Merger Agreement since the meeting of the Board held the prior day. Representatives of\nLatham & Watkins reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties in the context of a sale of ChemoCentryx for cash consideration, as they\nhad previously done. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed Goldman Sachs\u2019s financial analyses with respect to the Merger and rendered its oral\nopinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 3, 2022, to the Board that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon\nand subject to the assumptions, qualifications and other matters and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of\nshares of ChemoCentryx common stock (other than as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such holders. Upon consideration of the factors more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nRecommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\u201d, the Board (1) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and its stockholders, (2) approved, adopted and declared advisable\nthe Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (3) directed the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted\nto a vote at a meeting of ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders and (4) resolved to recommend that ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders vote to approve the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger. The foregoing approval of the Board was subsequently ratified by unanimous written consent of the\nBoard dated August 3, 2022.\nLater on the night of August 3, 2022, following the meeting of the Board, ChemoCentryx, Amgen and Merger Sub executed the Merger Agreement.\nBefore market open on the morning of August 4, 2022, ChemoCentryx and Amgen publicly announced the execution of the Merger Agreement.",

            "text": "Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Board\nThe Board has unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to,\nand in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and its stockholders\u037e (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger\u037e (iii) resolved to recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger\nby ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders\u037e and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that ChemoCentryx stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Compensation\nProposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Board consulted with members of ChemoCentryx\u2019s senior\nmanagement, representatives of ChemoCentryx\u2019s legal advisor, Latham & Watkins, and representatives of ChemoCentryx\u2019s financial advisor, Goldman\nSachs. In the course of reaching its\n48Table of Contents\ndetermination and recommendation, the Board reviewed, evaluated and considered a significant amount of information and numerous factors and\nbenefits, including those listed below (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which it viewed as supporting its (i) determination\nthat the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of ChemoCentryx and its\nstockholders\u037e (ii) approval and adoption of, and declaration that it is advisable for ChemoCentryx to enter into, the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) resolution to\nrecommend that ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders vote to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger on the terms and subject\nto the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e and (iv) direction that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of\nChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders at the Special Meeting:\n\u2022\nPremium to Market Price. The Board considered the relationship of the Merger Consideration to the price of our common stock immediately\nprior to the execution of the Merger Agreement and the recent historical market price and volatility of our common stock, including the fact\nthat the Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 123% to the $23.27 closing price per share of our common stock on\nNasdaq on August 2, 2022, the last trading day prior to the date on which the Merger Agreement was executed, a premium of approximately\n118% to the trailing volume-weighted average price per share of $23.84 for the thirty (30) calendar day period ended August 2, 2022, and a\npremium of approximately 138% to the trailing volume-weighted average price per share of $21.81 for the ninety (90) calendar day period\nended August 2, 2022. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration represents the highest value reasonably available for the shares\nof our common stock for the foreseeable future, taking into account the Board\u2019s familiarity with the business strategy, assets and prospects\nof ChemoCentryx and the recent historical market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nCertainty of Value. The Board considered the all-cash nature of the Merger Consideration to be received by ChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders\nin the Merger, which would provide liquidity and certainty of value to our stockholders while avoiding exposure to ChemoCentryx\u2019s clinical,\nregulatory, commercialization and other business risks. Taking into account the business, operations, prospects, strategic and short and\nlong term operating plans, assets, liabilities and financial condition of ChemoCentryx, the Board weighed the certainty of realizing\ncompelling value for shares of our common stock by virtue of the Merger against the uncertain prospect that the trading value of shares of\nour common stock would approach the Merger Consideration in the foreseeable future and the risks and uncertainties associated with our\nbusiness generally, including those described below and those discussed in ChemoCentryx\u2019s public filings with the SEC. See \u201cWhere You\nCan Find More Information\u201d beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement.\n\u2022\nPossible Strategic Alternatives. The Board considered the process conducted by ChemoCentryx, with the assistance of representatives of\nGoldman Sachs, to identify whether other potential parties might be interested in pursuing an acquisition of ChemoCentryx, taking into\naccount the expected interest of such parties generally, their financial capability to consummate a transaction of this size, and their ability to\nmove expeditiously and efficiently to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an acquisition of ChemoCentryx and consummate\nsuch transaction. In particular, the Board considered the recent outreach by representatives of Goldman Sachs and members of\nChemoCentryx\u2019s senior management with respect to such parties believed to be most likely to have interest in pursuing such an acquisition\nof ChemoCentryx, and considered the responses received from such contacted parties, including the fact that only Party E (in addition to\nAmgen) submitted a proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx (which the Board did not consider compelling relative to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement and the Merger Consideration), that Party A had ultimately declined to submit a proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx, and that\nparties that were considered reasonably likely to have potential interest in acquiring ChemoCentryx had either declined to engage with\nChemoCentryx regarding a potential sale transaction or had not responded to representatives of Goldman Sachs following their initial\noutreach.\n\u2022\nFull and Fair Value. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration of $52.00 per share of our common stock represents full and fair\nvalue for our shares of common stock, taking into account the\n49\nTable of Contents\nBoard\u2019s familiarity with the business strategy, assets and prospects of ChemoCentryx on a standalone basis and the relative certainty of the\ncash consideration payable in the Merger as compared to the risks and uncertainties of continuing on a standalone basis as an independent\npublic company.\n\u2022\nHighest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration of $52.00 per share of our common stock\nrepresents the highest value reasonably obtainable for our shares of common stock for the foreseeable future, taking into account the\nbusiness, operations, prospects, business strategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of ChemoCentryx. The Board also\nconsidered the progress and the outcome of ChemoCentryx\u2019s negotiations with Amgen, including the increase in the consideration offered\nby Amgen from the time of its initial expression of interest to the end of the negotiations, a number of changes in the terms and conditions\nof the Merger Agreement from the version initially proposed by Amgen that were favorable to ChemoCentryx, and the fact that a number of\nother strategic parties that had been contacted with respect to a potential acquisition of ChemoCentryx had either determined not to engage\nwith ChemoCentryx, had determined that it would not be capable of entering into a strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx at such time, or\nhad otherwise failed to submit a proposal that the Board considered compelling relative to the terms of the Merger and the Merger\nConsideration of $52.00 per share of our common stock. Further, the Board believed, based on these negotiations, that the Merger\nConsideration was the highest price per share that Amgen was willing to pay and that the Merger Agreement contained the most favorable\nterms to ChemoCentryx to which Amgen was willing to agree.\n\u2022\nLikelihood of Consummation. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, including the likelihood of consummation, based upon the scope of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger,\nthe relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, the remedies available to ChemoCentryx under the Merger Agreement in\nthe event of various breaches by Amgen, including specific performance, and Amgen\u2019s reputation in the biopharmaceutical industry and its\nfinancial capacity to complete an acquisition of this size, which the Board believed supported the conclusion that a transaction with Amgen\ncould be completed relatively expeditiously and in an orderly manner.\n\u2022\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 Opinion and Related Analyses. The Board considered the opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board on August 3,\n2022, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated such date, that, as of such date and based upon and subject\nto the assumptions, qualifications and other matters and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of\nshares of ChemoCentryx common stock (other than those specified in such opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders, as well as its related analyses, as more fully described under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Goldman\nSachs & Co. LLC\u201d beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement.\n\u2022\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which was the product of arms\u2019-\nlength negotiations with the assistance of ChemoCentryx\u2019s advisors, including the structure of the transaction, the all-cash form of the\nMerger Consideration, the limited scope of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, and the customary nature of the\nrepresentations, warranties, and the covenants and agreements of the parties. For the reasons noted below, the Board believed that the\nprovisions of the Merger Agreement were advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and our stockholders. In\nparticular:\n\u2022\nNo Financing Condition. The Board considered the representation of Amgen that Amgen would have sufficient cash or other liquid\nfinancial resources or undrawn financial commitments to consummate the Merger, and that the consummation of the Merger is not\nsubject to a financing condition.\n\u2022\nNo Solicitation Covenants and Fiduciary Outs. The Board considered the non-solicitation covenants and \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provisions\nof the Merger Agreement, which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof and limitations set forth therein, permit ChemoCentryx to\nfurnish information to, and to engage in discussions or negotiations with, third parties that make unsolicited Acquisition Proposals\n50\nTable of Contents\nmeeting certain criteria, permit the Board to change its recommendation to stockholders regarding the Merger Agreement under\ncertain circumstances and permit ChemoCentryx to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement\nrelating to a Superior Proposal, subject to, among other things, payment of a termination fee to Amgen. The Board further considered\nits ability to change its recommendation to stockholders regarding the Merger Agreement in response to an Intervening Event if the\nfailure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board under applicable law. The\nBoard further considered the fact that the approximately $119.3 million termination fee payable by ChemoCentryx in the event the\nMerger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, in the opinion of the Board, (i) is reasonable in light of the overall terms\nof the Merger Agreement and the benefits of the Merger, (ii) is consistent with the amount of such fees payable in comparable\ntransactions on a relative basis and (iii) would not be a substantial impediment or preclude another party from making a competing\nproposal to acquire ChemoCentryx.\n\u2022\nEnd Date. The Board considered the fact that the End Date under the Merger Agreement, on which either party, subject to certain\nexceptions, can terminate the Merger Agreement, allows for sufficient time to consummate the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, but also prevents the Merger Agreement from being extended for an unreasonable amount of time.\n\u2022\nEnforcement. The Board considered ChemoCentryx\u2019s ability to obtain specific enforcement of the obligations of Amgen and Merger\nSub under the Merger Agreement, thereby ensuring that ChemoCentryx has an appropriate remedy in the event Amgen and Merger\nSub were to decline to comply with their obligations under the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nStockholder Approval\u037e Appraisal Rights. The Board considered that the adoption of the Merger Agreement would be subject to the\napproval of our stockholders, that stockholders would be free to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and that\nstockholders who do not vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law\nwill be entitled to such appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.\n\u2022\nConditions to Closing\u037e Interim Operations. The Board considered the fact that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement\nminimize, to the extent reasonably practical, the risk that a condition to consummation of the Merger would not be satisfied and also\nprovide reasonable flexibility to operate ChemoCentryx\u2019s business during the pendency of the Merger, including with respect to\nactions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Board, in consultation with members of ChemoCentryx\u2019s senior management, also assessed ChemoCentryx\u2019s prospects for substantially\nincreasing stockholder value as a standalone company in excess of the Merger Consideration given the risks and uncertainties in ChemoCentryx\u2019s\nbusiness, including, but not limited to, the following (which are not listed in any relative order of importance) and those discussed in ChemoCentryx\u2019s\npublic filings with the SEC (see \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement):\n\u2022\nthe fact that ChemoCentryx has received orphan drug designation and orphan drug exclusivity for TAVNEOS in the United States, Japan\nand the European Union in the disease for which it is approved, but may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation or orphan drug\nexclusivity in other jurisdictions or for other indications of TAVNEOS for which ChemoCentryx pursues development or for any drug\nproduct candidates, and ChemoCentryx may not be able to maintain orphan drug exclusivity for TAVNEOS, or maintain orphan drug\nexclusivity for any drug product candidate for which ChemoCentryx may obtain orphan drug exclusivity\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possible failure or delays of current or future preclinical studies or clinical trials\u037e\n\u2022\nChemoCentryx\u2019s reliance on third parties to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials and the risks and costs of engaging additional\npartners or hiring additional personnel as ChemoCentryx\u2019s preclinical, clinical and commercial activities increase\u037e\n51\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nChemoCentryx\u2019s reliance on third party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply TAVNEOS and our drug product\ncandidates\u037e\n\u2022\nChemoCentryx\u2019s reliance on third party partners and sublicensees for the marketing, commercialization and sale of TAVNEOS in certain\nterritories\u037e\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of the outcomes of ongoing and planned clinical trials and the potential to not obtain regulatory approval, including the\npotential identification of safety-related concerns associated with the use of a drug product candidate\u037e\n\u2022\nthe significant risks and challenges associated with commercializing TAVNEOS, the costs associated with successfully scaling commercial\noperations and the risk that ChemoCentryx will be unable to generate adequate product revenue or achieve and maintain profitability\u037e\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing and costs of expanding the commercialization of TAVNEOS outside of its current markets and indications and risks if\nChemoCentryx is unable to maintain an effective sales and marketing and distribution capability to maximize its potential across a range of\nmarkets and indications\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks inherent in obtaining regulatory approvals from government payors and adequate reimbursement from regulatory authorities and\nother third party payors to be able to sell TAVNEOS and our drug product candidates\u037e\n\u2022\nrisks and potential delays relating to the manufacturing and supply of TAVNEOS and ChemoCentryx\u2019s drug product candidates, including\ndue to the failure of third party manufacturers to comply with manufacturing regulations\u037e\n\u2022\nrisks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants, and the potential impact of such risks and\nuncertainties on a standalone strategy-basis and the trading price of our common stock, including the uncertainty related to the spread of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and the potential consequences of the pandemic on the financial markets and ChemoCentryx\u2019s current and future\nbusiness and operations, which could include: delays of ChemoCentryx\u2019s ongoing and planned clinical trials\u037e decreases and delays in\nsupplier, vendor and collaboration partner interactions as a result of government and other restrictions\u037e delays in interactions with and\nresponses from governmental authorities\u037e and disruptions in the operations of clinical research organizations and other third parties upon\nwhom ChemoCentryx relies\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe current state of the U.S. and global economies, including the recent downward trend in the biopharmaceutical financial markets,\nincreased volatility resulting from escalating political and global trade tensions, and the current and potential impact in both the near term\nand long term on the biopharmaceutical industry and the future commercialization efforts required with respect to ChemoCentryx\u2019s drug\nproducts and drug product candidates that are or become approved for sale, including the numerous risks, costs and uncertainties\nassociated with research, development and commercialization of ChemoCentryx\u2019s pipeline programs, all of which risks are enhanced by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and may remain present following the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Board, in consultation with members of ChemoCentryx\u2019s senior management and representatives of\nChemoCentryx\u2019s outside financial and legal advisors, also considered a variety of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors concerning\nthe Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (which are not listed in\nany relative order of importance):\n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Earnings or Growth. The Board considered that the nature of the Merger as a cash transaction\nmeans that, if the Merger is consummated, our stockholders will not participate in future earnings or growth of ChemoCentryx and will not\nbenefit from any appreciation in the value of ChemoCentryx\u2019s business or the shares of the surviving corporation.\n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, including the Merger, might not be\n52\nTable of Contents\nconsummated, and that consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions that may not be within our control,\nincluding receipt of the necessary regulatory clearances and approvals and that no Material Adverse Effect with respect to ChemoCentryx\nhas occurred that is continuing. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations\nto consummate the Merger will be satisfied and, as a result, it is possible that the Merger may not be consummated even if the Merger\nAgreement is adopted by our stockholders. The Board considered the fact that if the Merger is not consummated (i) we will have incurred\nsignificant transaction and opportunity costs, including the possibility of disruption to our operations, diversion of management and\nemployee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our business and customer relationships, (ii) the trading price of\nour common stock may be adversely affected, and (iii) the market\u2019s perceptions of our prospects could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nInterim Operating Covenants. The Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of our business during the pendency of the Merger,\nwhich may delay or prevent ChemoCentryx from undertaking potential business opportunities that may arise, may have a material adverse\neffect on our ability to respond to changing market and business conditions in a timely manner (or at all), or may negatively affect our ability\nto attract, retain and motivate key personnel. The Board also considered that the focus and resources of ChemoCentryx\u2019s management may\nbecome diverted from other important business opportunities and operational matters while working to consummate the Merger, which\ncould adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nNo Solicitation Covenants and Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that, subject to certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement\nprecludes ChemoCentryx and its representatives from soliciting, or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations relating to,\nalternative acquisition proposals, and requires ChemoCentryx to pay to Amgen a termination fee of approximately $119.3 million if the\nMerger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including a termination of the Merger Agreement by ChemoCentryx to enter\ninto a definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal, as described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee\u037e Certain Expenses\u201d\nbeginning on page 101 of this proxy statement. The Board also considered, but did not consider preclusive, the fact that the right afforded\nto Amgen under the Merger Agreement to propose amendments or modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in\nresponse to a Superior Proposal may discourage other parties that might otherwise have an interest in a business combination with, or an\nacquisition of, ChemoCentryx. The Board also considered that the amount of the termination fee, as compared to termination fees in\ntransactions of a similar size, in the opinion of the Board, was reasonable, would not likely deter competing bids. The Board also recognized\nthat the provisions in the Merger Agreement relating to non-solicitation and the termination fee were required by Amgen as conditions to\nentering into the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nEffect of Transaction Announcement. The Board considered the potential effect of the announcement of the Merger Agreement, including\neffects on our stock price and operations, including our relationships with suppliers, distributors, vendors, collaborators and employees,\nand our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well\nas the possibility of a suit, action or proceeding in respect of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.\n\u2022\nTransaction Costs. The Board considered the fact that we have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and\nexpenses in connection with the Merger, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.\n\u2022\nTaxable Transaction. The Board considered that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to our stockholders that are\ntreated as U.S. Holders for United States federal income tax purposes.\n\u2022\nInterests of Directors and Executive Officers. The Board considered the possibility that ChemoCentryx\u2019s directors and executive officers\nmay have interests in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that may be different from, or in addition to, those of\nChemoCentryx\u2019s stockholders generally. See \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of ChemoCentryx in the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement.\n53\nTable of Contents\nAfter considering the foregoing potentially negative factors, the Board concluded that the potential benefits of the Merger substantially\noutweighed the risks or potential negative consequences.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive, but includes the\nmaterial reasons and factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions and recommendation in relation to the Merger, the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions proposed thereby. In light of the variety of reasons and factors considered and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not\nfind it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons or factors considered in reaching their\ndeterminations and recommendations. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including thorough discussions\nwith, and questioning of, members of our senior management and representatives of our outside financial advisor and legal counsel. Individual directors\nmay have given differing weights to different factors or may have had different reasons for their ultimate determination. In addition, the Board did not\nreach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered. Instead, the Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors\nand reasons described above and determined in its business judgment that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits of the Merger to the stockholders of\nChemoCentryx outweighed the risks or potential negative consequences. It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the Board and\ncertain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in \u201cCautionary Statement\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 33 of this proxy statement.",

        "Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC": {
            "text": "Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nGoldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Board that, as of August 3, 2022 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth\ntherein, the $52.00 in cash per share of ChemoCentryx common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Amgen and its affiliates) of such shares\npursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 3, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Goldman Sachs\nprovided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The\nGoldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any\nother matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other\nthings:\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of ChemoCentryx for the five years ended December 31, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of ChemoCentryx\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain other communications from ChemoCentryx to its stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for ChemoCentryx\u037e and\n\u2022\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for ChemoCentryx, including assumed probabilities associated with certain future events\ncontemplated by such forecasts and certain analyses related to the expected utilization by ChemoCentryx of certain net operating loss\ncarryforwards, each as prepared by the management of ChemoCentryx and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by ChemoCentryx, as\ndescribed and summarized under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d (together, the \u201cFinancial\nInformation\u201d).\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of ChemoCentryx regarding their assessment of the past and current\nbusiness operations, financial condition and future prospects of\n54Table of Contents\nChemoCentryx\u037e reviewed the reported price and trading activity for ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock\u037e compared certain financial and stock market\ninformation for ChemoCentryx with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded\u037e reviewed the financial terms\nof certain recent business combinations in the biopharmaceutical industry and in other industries\u037e and performed such other studies and analyses, and\nconsidered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with ChemoCentryx\u2019s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of\nall of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any\nresponsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with ChemoCentryx\u2019s consent, that the Financial Information\nwas reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of the management of ChemoCentryx. Goldman Sachs did\nnot make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and\nliabilities) of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs\nassumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any\nadverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the Merger will be\nconsummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in\nany way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of ChemoCentryx to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the\nMerger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to ChemoCentryx\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting\nmatters. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $52.00 in cash per share of\nChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Amgen and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any\nterm or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger,\nincluding the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of ChemoCentryx\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers,\ndirectors or employees of ChemoCentryx, or class of such persons in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $52.00 in cash per share of\nChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Amgen and its affiliates) of shares of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and\nthe information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion, and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its\nopinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any\nopinion as to the prices at which shares of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock will trade at any time, or as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit,\nfinancial and stock markets on ChemoCentryx, Amgen or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of ChemoCentryx or\nAmgen or the ability of ChemoCentryx or Amgen to pay their respective obligations when they become due. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a\nfairness committee of Goldman Sachs.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board in connection with rendering the opinion\ndescribed above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs,\nnor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of\nthe financial analyses may include information presented in tabular format. Any such tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and\nare alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent\nthat it is based\n55\nTable of Contents\non market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before August 2, 2022, the last trading day before the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion, and is\nnot necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nHistorical Stock Trading Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices and volumes for the shares of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common\nstock for the one-year period ended August 2, 2022. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders (other than Amgen and\nits affiliates) of shares of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement in relation to the (i) the closing price per share of\nChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock on August 2, 2022, the last trading day before the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion, (ii) the high closing price per share of\nChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock for the 52-week period ended August 2, 2022, and (iii) the volume weighted average price (the \u201cVWAP\u201d) per share of\nChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock for the preceding thirty-, sixty- and ninety-calendar day periods ended August 2, 2022.\nThis analysis indicated that the price per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock to be paid to holders (other than Amgen and its affiliates) of\nshares of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement represented:\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 123% based on the closing price per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock of $23.27 on August 2, 2022, the\nlast trading day before the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 28% based on the highest closing price per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock of $40.50 for the 52-week\nperiod ended August 2, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 118% based on the VWAP per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock of $23.84 for the thirty-calendar day\nperiod ended August 2, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 113% based on the VWAP per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock of $24.47 for the sixty-calendar day\nperiod ended August 2, 2022\u037e and\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 138% based on the VWAP per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock of $21.81 for the ninety-calendar day\nperiod ended August 2, 2022.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\u2014TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows. Using the Financial Information, Goldman Sachs performed an\nillustrative discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the estimated present value of ChemoCentryx based on estimates of unlevered free cash flows for\nthe third and fourth quarters of 2022 and years 2023 through 2044 to be derived from the commercialization of TAVNEOS for its indication in ANCA-\nassociated vasculitis, as reflected in the Financial Information (such standalone unlevered free cash flows referred to as the \u201cTAVNEOS AAV Only Cash\nFlows\u201d). Using a mid-year convention and discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting estimates of ChemoCentryx\u2019s weighted average cost of\ncapital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 (i) the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal\nvalues for ChemoCentryx based on the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from\nnegative 20% to 0% to a terminal year estimate of the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows, as reflected in the Financial Information. In addition, using\ndiscount rates ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting estimates of ChemoCentryx\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to\npresent value as of June 30, 2022 the estimated benefits of ChemoCentryx\u2019s net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and\nyears 2023 through 2044, as reflected in the Financial Information. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing\nModel, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including ChemoCentryx\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax\nyield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for ChemoCentryx, as well as certain financial metrics for the\nUnited States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and\nexperience, taking into account the Financial Information and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product, and\ninflation. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for ChemoCentryx based on the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows by adding the\nranges of the present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then added to such ranges of illustrative enterprise values it derived for ChemoCentryx\nbased on the\n56\nTable of Contents\nTAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows the net cash balance of $322.0 million as of June 30, 2022 of ChemoCentryx and the net present value of $200.0 million in\nfinancing expected at the end of 2022 as reflected in the Financial Information, in each case, as provided by the management of ChemoCentryx, to derive a\nrange of illustrative equity values for ChemoCentryx based on the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative\nequity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx as of August 2, 2022, as provided by the management of\nChemoCentryx, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share ranging from $41.01 to $45.91.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\u2014Aggregate Cash Flows. Using the Financial Information, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative\ndiscounted cash flow analysis to calculate the estimated present value of ChemoCentryx based on (A) the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows and (B)\nestimates of the unlevered free cash flows for the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and years 2023 through 2044 to be derived from the commercialization\nof TAVNEOS for indications other than ANCA-associated vasculitis and the Company\u2019s CCX559 and CCX507 pipeline drug candidates, as reflected in\nthe Financial Information (the cash flows described in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the \u201cAggregate Cash Flows\u201d).\nUsing discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting estimates of ChemoCentryx\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs\ndiscounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 (i) the Aggregate Cash Flows and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for ChemoCentryx based on\nthe Aggregate Cash Flows, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from negative 20% to 0% to a terminal year estimate of the\nAggregate Cash Flows, as reflected in the Financial Information. In addition, using a mid-year convention and discount rates ranging from 11.5% to\n13.5%, reflecting estimates of ChemoCentryx\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 the\nestimated benefits of ChemoCentryx\u2019s NOLs for the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and years 2023 through 2044, as reflected in the Financial\nInformation. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific\ninputs, including ChemoCentryx\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future\napplicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for ChemoCentryx, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The\nrange of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Financial\nInformation and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product, and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of\nillustrative enterprise values for ChemoCentryx based on the Aggregate Cash Flows by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman\nSachs then added to the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for ChemoCentryx based on the Aggregate Cash Flows the net cash balance of\n$322.0 million as of June 30, 2022 of ChemoCentryx and the net present value of the $200.0 million in financing expected at the end of 2022 as reflected in\nthe Financial Information, in each case, as provided by the management of ChemoCentryx, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for\nChemoCentryx based on the Aggregate Cash Flows. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully\ndiluted outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx as of August 2, 2022, as provided by the management of ChemoCentryx, using the treasury stock method, to\nderive a range of illustrative present values per share ranging from $51.80 to $59.60.\nPremia Analysis\u2014Undisturbed Closing Stock Price. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition\npremia for transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2015 through August 2, 2022 involving a public company in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry as the target where the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was between $3.0 billion and $8.0 billion. For the same\ntransactions, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in\nsuch transactions relative to the applicable target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the applicable transaction. This\nanalysis indicated a median premium of 62% across such transactions. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 47% and 75th percentile\npremium of 92% across such transactions. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 47% to 92% to the\nundisturbed closing price per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock of $23.27 as of August 2, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per\nshare of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock of $34.21 to $44.68.\n57\nTable of Contents\nPremia Analysis\u201452-Week High Closing Stock Price. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition\npremia for transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2015 through August 2, 2022 involving a public company in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry as the target where the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was between $3.0 billion and $8.0 billion. For the same\ntransactions, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the average, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in\nsuch transactions relative to the applicable target\u2019s last undisturbed 52-week high closing stock prices prior to announcement of the applicable\ntransaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 21% across such transactions. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of\nnegative 1% and 75th percentile premium of 31% across such transactions. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative\npremiums of negative 1% to 31% to the October 11, 2021, $40.50 per share closing price of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock, which is the undisturbed 52-\nweek high closing price per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock for the 52-week period ended August 2, 2022, and calculated a range of implied\nequity values per share of ChemoCentryx\u2019s common stock of $40.10 to $53.06.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and\ndid not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis\nof its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a\ncomparison is directly comparable to ChemoCentryx or the Merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Board as to the fairness from a financial point\nof view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $52.00 in cash per share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Amgen and its affiliates)\nof such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which\nbusinesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being\nbased upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of ChemoCentryx, Amgen, Goldman Sachs or\nany other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between ChemoCentryx and Amgen and was approved by the Board.\nGoldman Sachs provided advice to ChemoCentryx during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of\nconsideration to ChemoCentryx or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nAs described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger,\u201d\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in making its determination to approve the Merger\nAgreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the\nfairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment\nmanagement and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and\nemployees, and funds or other entities they\n58\nTable of Contents\nmanage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short\npositions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of\nChemoCentryx, Amgen, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to ChemoCentryx in connection with, and participated in certain\nnegotiations leading to, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. During the two-year period ended August 3, 2022,\nthe Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by ChemoCentryx or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting\nservices for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to\nAmgen and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having\nacted as financial advisor to Amgen in connection with its acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics in April 2021\u037e as bookrunner in connection with the\npublic offering by Amgen of its 1.650% Senior Notes due 2028 (aggregate principal amount $1,250,000,000), 2.000% Senior Notes due 2032 (aggregate\nprincipal amount $1,250,000,000), 2.800% Senior Notes due 2041 (aggregate principal amount $1,150,000,000), and 3.000% Senior Notes due 2052\n(aggregate principal amount $1,350,000,000) in August 2021\u037e as financial advisor to Amgen in connection with its acquisition of Teneobio, Inc. in October\n2021\u037e and as bookrunner in connection with the public offering by Amgen of its 3.000% Senior Notes due 2029 (aggregate principal amount $750,000,000),\n3.350% Senior Notes due 2032 (aggregate principal amount $1,000,000,000), 4.200% Senior Notes due 2052 (aggregate principal amount $1,000,000,000),\nand 4.400% Senior Notes due 2062 (aggregate principal amount $1,250,000,000) in February 2022. During the two-year period ended August 3, 2022,\nGoldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Amgen\nand/or its affiliates of approximately $23.0 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to\nChemoCentryx, Amgen, and their respective affiliates for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.\nThe Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial\nexperience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 28, 2022, ChemoCentryx engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its\nfinancial advisor in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between ChemoCentryx and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is\nestimated, based on the information available as of the date of the announcement of ChemoCentryx\u2019s entry into the Merger Agreement, to be\napproximately $40.0 million, payable upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, ChemoCentryx has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for\ncertain of its expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities,\nincluding certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nWe do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to our future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty,\nunpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, ChemoCentryx\u2019s management regularly prepares and reviews\nwith the Board estimates regarding the success and timing of the development of, regulatory filings and approvals for and the commercialization of our\nproducts and product candidates, as well as various partnership scenarios for the development and commercialization of our product candidates outside\nof the United States. In connection with our strategic planning process and the Board\u2019s evaluation of the Merger, as described further in the section of\nthis proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the Merger,\u201d ChemoCentryx\u2019s management prepared and reviewed with the Board certain\nunaudited prospective financial information of ChemoCentryx as an independent company for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 and for fiscal\nyears 2023 through 2044, as prepared and used as described below (referred to as the \u201cUnaudited Prospective Financial Information)\u201d.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and was provided to the Board\nfor the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the Merger.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was also provided to, and approved by ChemoCentryx for use by, Goldman Sachs, ChemoCentryx\u2019s\nfinancial advisor, for the purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses and fairness opinion in connection with the Merger (as described in more detail\nin the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d). The Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation includes estimates of ChemoCentryx\u2019s financial performance on a probability-adjusted basis. With ChemoCentryx\u2019s consent, Goldman Sachs\nassumed that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then available estimates and\njudgments of our management as to our future financial performance, and relied on ChemoCentryx\u2019s assessments as to the validity of, and risks\nassociated with, our products and product candidates.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed based on ChemoCentryx\u2019s management\u2019s knowledge of and assumptions with\nrespect to ChemoCentryx\u2019s business, including with respect to the commercialization of TAVNEOS for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis and\nin other indications and ChemoCentryx\u2019s CCX559 and CCX507 pipeline drug candidates. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed\nwithout giving effect to the Merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, the expenses that have\nalready or may be incurred in connection with completing the Merger or any changes to ChemoCentryx\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented\nduring the pendency of or following the consummation of the Merger. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also does not consider the effect\nof any failure of the Merger to be completed\u037e it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d). In addition, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared\nwith a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to\nprospective financial information. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have (1) compiled,\nreviewed, audited, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, (2) expressed any opinion or\nany other form of assurance on such information or the achievability of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information or (3) assumed any\nresponsibility for the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\nBecause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to sensitivities and assumptions, as\nwell as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also covers\nmultiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nis not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not fact\nand should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our future results.\nAlthough the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates\nas to future events. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to achieve our goals for the\ndevelopment, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates, including on the timeline assumed for purposes of the\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects assumptions and uncertainties that are subject to\nchange. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information not to be achieved are described in\nvarious risk factors described in the sections of this proxy statement captioned \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and in\nour other filings with the SEC, including those listed under the section captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d All of these factors are\ndifficult to predict, and many of them are outside of our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,\nwhether or not the Merger is consummated. The Unaudited\n60\nTable of Contents\nProspective Financial Information also reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. The Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and does not consider any events or circumstances after the date that it\nwas prepared, including the announcement of the entry into the Merger Agreement. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information has not been\nupdated or revised to reflect information or results after the date it was prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. Except to the extent required by\napplicable federal securities laws, we do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information to reflect\ncircumstances existing after the date that such information was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events. ChemoCentryx has or may report\nresults of operations for periods included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information that were or will be completed following the preparation of\nthe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. Stockholders and investors are urged to refer to ChemoCentryx\u2019s periodic filings with the SEC for\ninformation on ChemoCentryx\u2019s actual historical results.\nCertain of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information are \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures.\u201d These are\nfinancial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a\nsubstitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are\nlimitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation.\nIn certain circumstances, including those applicable to the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, financial measures included in forecasts\nprovided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business combination transaction are excluded from the definition of \u201cnon-\nGAAP financial measures\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not subject to SEC\nrules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP\nfinancial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Board or Goldman Sachs. Accordingly, no\nreconciliation of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is provided in this proxy statement.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. By including the Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation in this proxy statement, neither we nor any of our representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding our ultimate\nperformance as compared to the information contained in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, ChemoCentryx or any other person considered, or now considers, the\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information to be predictive of actual future results. Further, the inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by ChemoCentryx that the information presented is material.

As of September 13, 2022, none of our directors or executive officers held any RSUs that would be converted\ninto Amgen Cash Awards at the Effective Time. These amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional equity award grants, issuances or forfeitures\nthat may occur prior to the Effective Time following the date of this proxy statement. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not\nactually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, the actual amounts to be received by ChemoCentryx\u2019s directors and executive officers may materially\ndiffer from the amounts set forth below. This table also does not include any outstanding rights to purchase shares under the ESPP held by our executive\nofficers or any outstanding stock options the exercise price of which is in excess of $52.00 per share and which will be cancelled for no consideration at\nthe Effective Time.

Under each of the employment\nagreements, if ChemoCentryx terminates an executive officer\u2019s employment without \u201ccause\u201d or if the executive officer resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d, in each\ncase within 12 months following a change in control, subject to the execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, such executive officer will be\nentitled to receive: (1) a lump sum cash payment equal to the executive officer\u2019s monthly base salary as in effect immediately prior to the involuntary\ntermination for the 18 month period following the date of termination or resignation, (2) a lump sum cash payment equal to one and one-half times the\nexecutive officer\u2019s target bonus for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurred, (3) until the date that is 18 months following the date of\ntermination (or, if earlier, the date on which the applicable continuation period under COBRA ends), reimbursement of the costs associated with\ncontinuation coverage pursuant to COBRA for the executive officer and his or her eligible dependents covered under ChemoCentryx\u2019s health plans as of\nthe date of termination, such that the executive officer\u2019s premiums are the same as for active employees, and (4) accelerated vesting of all of the executive\nofficer\u2019s outstanding stock awards upon the date of effectiveness of the release. The foregoing change-in-control severance benefits will only apply so\nlong as the executive officer is working on a full-time basis.\nFor purposes of the employment agreements, \u201ccause\u201d means an executive officer (1) has committed an act of fraud, embezzlement or dishonesty in\nconnection with the executive officer\u2019s employment, or has intentionally committed some other illegal

in\naccordance with any lawful and proper direction or order of the board of directors or the appropriate individual to whom the executive officer reports\u037e\nprovided such direction is not materially inconsistent with the executive officer\u2019s customary duties and responsibilities.\nFor purposes of the employment agreements, \u201cgood reason\u201d means (1) a material diminution in the executive officer\u2019s authority, duties or\nresponsibilities, (2) a material diminution in the authority, duties or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the named executive officer is required to\nreport, (3) a material diminution in the executive officer\u2019s base compensation unless such a reduction is imposed across-the-board to senior management\nof the company, (4) a material change in the geographic location at which the executive officer must perform his or her duties, or (5) any other action or\ninaction that constitutes a material breach by the company or any successor or affiliate of its obligations to the executive officer under the employment\nagreement.\nEmployment Agreements with Mr. Butt and Dr. Jain\nChemoCentryx has entered into employment

officer\u2019s eligibility for COBRA\ncontinuation coverage, or (C) the date on which the executive officer becomes eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in\nconnection with new employment or self-employment, and (4) accelerated vesting of the service-based vesting requirements of the executive officer\u2019s\noutstanding equity awards as of the date of termination (with any performance-based equity awards treated in accordance with their terms).\nFor purposes of the employment agreements with Mr. Butt and Dr. Jain, \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cgood reason\u201d generally have the meanings given to such\nterms in the employment agreements with the other executive officers described above.\nFor an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of ChemoCentryx\u2019s named executive officers upon a qualifying termination at the\nEffective Time of the Merger under their employment agreements, see \u201cProposal No. 2: Advisory Vote on the Merger

proxy statement.\nChemoCentryx Annual Bonus Plan\nIf the Closing Date occurs before annual bonuses for fiscal year 2022 are paid, Amgen will, or will cause the surviving corporation to, pay each\neligible executive officer the amounts payable to such executive officer under ChemoCentryx\u2019s annual bonus plan (A) if the Closing Date occurs prior to\nDecember 31, 2022, based on the target level of performance, or (B) if the Closing Date occurs on or after January 1, 2023, based on the actual level of\nperformance and individual earned bonus amounts as determined by ChemoCentryx no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time. If an executive\nofficer is terminated prior to the payment of his or her fiscal year 2022 bonus under the circumstances that would give rise to severance under such\nexecutive officer\u2019s employment agreement, then subject to such executive officer\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in the same form\nto be executed under his or her employment agreement, such executive officer will remain entitled to receive such fiscal year 2022 bonus, prorated for the\nportion of fiscal year 2022 elapsed prior to the date of termination if such termination occurs prior to December 31, 2022. The payment of any such\nprorated bonus is in addition to the severance under his or her employment agreement, as described above.\nFor an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of ChemoCentryx\u2019s named executive officers upon a qualifying termination at the\neffective time of the Merger under ChemoCentryx\u2019s annual bonus plan, see \u201cProposal No. 2: Advisory Vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal\u2014The\nMerger Compensation Proposal\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to ChemoCentryx\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d beginning on page\n105 of this proxy statement.\nNew Amgen Arrangements\nCertain of ChemoCentryx\u2019s executive officers may continue to provide employment or other services to Amgen after the Effective Time and may\nenter into new agreements, arrangements or understandings with Amgen to set forth the terms and compensation of such post-Closing service. As of the\ndate of this proxy statement, no such agreements, arrangements or understandings with Amgen exist.\n66\nTable of Contents\nTax Planning Strategies\nUnder the Merger Agreement, if the Closing Date is not reasonably expected to occur in 2022, ChemoCentryx may implement tax planning strategies\nfor the purpose of mitigating the impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code on ChemoCentryx\u2019s executive officers and preserve certain compensation-\nrelated tax deductions that might otherwise be disallowed. Such tax planning strategies will not include a gross-up of any excise taxes under Section 4999\nof the Code, but may include vesting certain equity awards in the second half of December 2022 that are scheduled to vest in early 2023 or paying 2022\nbonuses (or a portion thereof) in the second half of December 2022. In addition, ChemoCentryx is permitted to enter into amendments to the employment\nagreements with each of Dr. Schall, Ms. Kanaya and Dr. Cappel to implement a standard \u201cbetter-net\u201d cutback with respect to Sections 280G and 4999 of\nthe Code. As of the date of this proxy statement, no such tax planning strategies or amendments have been finalized or implemented.\nIndemnification of Directors and Officers\u037e Insurance\nUnder the Merger Agreement, from and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,\nAmgen will cause the surviving corporation, among other things, to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former (as of August 3, 2022) director\nor officer of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries in their capacities as such against any losses incurred by such indemnified person in respect of any\npending or threatened litigation, action, suit, claim, demand or proceeding based upon or arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such indemnified\nperson was a director or officer of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters pending,\nexisting or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and any other applicable law, the certificate of incorporation and amended and\nrestated bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of ChemoCentryx and its subsidiaries in effect on August 3, 2022, and Amgen will cause the\nsurviving corporation to observe the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions in favor of ChemoCentryx\u2019s present and\nformer directors and officers (as of August 3, 2022) as set forth the certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws (or other similar\norganizational documents) of ChemoCentryx and its subsidiaries in effect on August 3, 2022, and the terms of certain indemnification agreements between\nChemoCentryx and its officers and directors.\nIn addition, prior to the Effective Time Amgen will, or will cause the surviving corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium (subject to\nlimitations set forth in the Merger Agreement) for the non-cancellable extension of the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability coverage of ChemoCentryx\u2019s\nexisting directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies for a claims reporting or discovery period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect\nto any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time and with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability no less favorable\nthan the coverage provided under ChemoCentryx\u2019s directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 and fiduciary liability insurance policies in effect as of August 3, 2022.

Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the\nloss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nIf you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: you must\ndeliver to ChemoCentryx a written demand for appraisal of your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock prior to the Special Meeting, which must\nreasonably inform us of the identity of the holder of record of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock who intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its\nshares of ChemoCentryx common stock and, for beneficial owners only, such demand is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial\nowner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an\naddress at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by ChemoCentryx and to be set forth on the Chancery List\u037e you must not vote\nor submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e you must hold your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock continuously\nthrough the effective date\u037e and you must comply with the other applicable requirements of Section 262.\n69\nTable of Contents\nA ChemoCentryx stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail or deliver his, her or its written demand for appraisal to the following\naddress:\nChemoCentryx, Inc.\n835 Industrial Road, Suite 600\nSan Carlos, CA 94070\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nA record holder who holds shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other\nnominee, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which such person is the\nrecord owner. In such case, the demand must set forth the number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock covered by such demand. Where the\nnumber of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of ChemoCentryx common\nstock outstanding in the name of such record owner.\nWithin ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the Merger has become effective to each (a)\nChemoCentryx stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement and (b) any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any\nperson who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and accept the Merger\nConsideration specified by the Merger Agreement for that person\u2019s shares of ChemoCentryx common stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a\nwritten withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective\nTime will require written approval of the surviving corporation. Unless the demand is properly withdrawn by the person within sixty (60) days after the\neffective date, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, with such approval conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. If the surviving corporation does not\napprove a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the\ndismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the person will be entitled to receive only the fair value of such person\u2019s shares of ChemoCentryx common stock\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the Merger\nConsideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation and any person who has properly and\ntimely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of the\nshares of ChemoCentryx common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of ChemoCentryx or the\nsurviving corporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should assume that ChemoCentryx and the surviving\ncorporation will not file such a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock. Accordingly,\npersons who desire to have their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their\nappraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, no\npetition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only\nto the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions\nof Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock not consented in writing or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were\nreceived by the surviving corporation and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such\n70\nTable of Contents\nstatement must be mailed within ten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation or within ten (10) days\nafter the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.\nUpon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving\ncorporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a\nduly verified list containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and\nwith whom the surviving corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (referred to as the \u201cChancery List\u201d). The Register in\nChancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or\ncertified mail to the surviving corporation and to all such person set forth on the Chancery List.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which\npersons have complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the\npersons who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their\ncertificates of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and\nif any person fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name\nappears on the Chancery List and may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights\nunder Section 262.\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nincluding any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the Delaware Court of Chancery shall determine the fair\nvalue of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound\nquarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the\nentry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest\nshall accrue after such payment only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of ChemoCentryx\ncommon stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid by the surviving corporation as part of\nthe pre-judgment payment to the person.\nWhen the fair value of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such\nvalue, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.\nAlthough ChemoCentryx believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and persons should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or\nlower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, the surviving corporation does not anticipate offering more than the Merger\nConsideration to any person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of the relevant shares of ChemoCentryx common stock is less than the Merger Consideration.\n71\nTable of Contents\nIn determining \u201cfair value\u201d, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the\nDelaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value\nby any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court\nhas stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of\nthe enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of\nthe merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of\nthe Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass\nknown elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In\nWeinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are\nknown or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d In addition, the Delaware courts have\ndecided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting person\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nThe cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her\nor its attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the\nproceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including,\nwithout limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of ChemoCentryx common stock\nentitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such and award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under\nSection 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware Court of Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nAny person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares of\nChemoCentryx common stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or\ndistributions payable to ChemoCentryx stockholders of record at a date prior to the Effective Time.\nTo the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on the other hand, Section 262 will\ngovern.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to holders of\nshares of ChemoCentryx common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions,\npublished positions of the Internal Revenue Service (referred to as the \u201cIRS\u201d), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy\nstatement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to\nholders that hold their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property\nheld for investment purposes). This summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not a complete description of all potential U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences of the Merger. This summary does not describe any of the tax\n72Table of Contents\nconsequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than\nincome taxation (e.g., state, gift or alternative minimum tax, the Medicare net investment income surtax, or any withholding considerations under the\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including regulations issued thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto\nor in connection therewith)). In addition, this summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares that exercise\nappraisal rights under the DGCL. For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cholder\u201d means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder or both, as the context may\nrequire.\nThis discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to\nholders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nholders that may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations,\ngovernmental organizations, S corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as pass-through entities or\npartnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any investor therein, insurance companies, mutual funds, brokers or dealers in stocks,\nsecurities, commodities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities,\nregulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations,\u201d \u201cpassive foreign investment companies\u201d\nor certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nholders holding their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as part of a hedging, straddle or other risk reducing transaction or as part of a\nconversion transaction or other integrated investment\u037e\n\u2022\nholders deemed to sell their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that received their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in compensatory transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that hold their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock through individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Amgen or the surviving corporation\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. Holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e or\n\u2022\nholders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of ChemoCentryx common stock (by vote or value).\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares\nof ChemoCentryx common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the\npartner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and partners therein should consult their tax\nadvisors regarding the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nWe have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the\nfollowing summary. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any\nchallenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.\nTHIS DISCUSSION OF MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY\nAND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY\nCONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR OTHER TAX LAWS.\n73\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this proxy statement, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock who or that is for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes:\n\u2022\nAn individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nA corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or\nthe District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nAn estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\nA trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons\nas defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a\nUnited States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash\nreceived and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock. Any such gain or loss\ngenerally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at\nthe time of the consummation of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gains generally will apply to long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S.\nHolders, including individuals. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of ChemoCentryx\ncommon stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to\neach block of ChemoCentryx common stock.\nPayments made to a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information\nreporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a rate of 24%. To avoid backup withholding on such payments, U.S. Holders that do not otherwise\nestablish an exemption should complete and return to the exchange agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal certifying\nthat such holder is a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such\nholder is not subject to backup withholding. Certain types of U.S. Holders (including, with respect to certain types of payments, corporations) generally\nare not subject to backup withholding or information reporting rules.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from cash payments to a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger under the backup\nwithholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against such U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup\nwithholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this proxy statement, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock that is\nneither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nNon-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax consequences that may be\nrelevant to them in light of their particular circumstances.\n74\nTable of Contents\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable\nincome tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such\ngain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a\ncorporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate specified under an applicable\ntax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition, and\ncertain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate\nspecified under an applicable tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder recognized in the same\ntaxable year (if any)\u037e or\n\u2022\nshares of ChemoCentryx common stock held by such Non-U.S. Holder constitute a United States real property interest by reason of\nChemoCentryx\u2019s status as a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code (a\n\u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time or the period that the Non-U.S.\nHolder held the applicable shares of ChemoCentryx common stock. ChemoCentryx believes it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC\nduring the five-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time.\nPayments made to Non-U.S. Holders in exchange for shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information\nreporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a rate of 24%. Non-U.S. Holders generally can avoid information reporting and backup withholding by\nproviding the exchange agent with the applicable and properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8 certifying the holder\u2019s non-U.S. status or by\notherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under an applicable tax treaty or\ninformation exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s\nU.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

ChemoCentryx, Inc., Case No. 3:22-cv-05019-LB. The complaint names ChemoCentryx and members of the Board as\ndefendants and alleges that the defendants made materially incomplete and misleading statements about the proposed acquisition of ChemoCentryx by\nAmgen. Specifically, the complaint alleges that all defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and that each Board member violated Section\n20(a) of the Exchange Act, and asserts claims challenging the adequacy of disclosures regarding ChemoCentryx\u2019s projections, Goldman\u2019s financial\nanalyses, and the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on August 31, 2022 (the\n\u201cPreliminary Proxy\u201d). The complaint seeks, among other relief, (i) injunctive relief preventing the parties from proceeding with the Merger until the alleged\ndisclosure deficiencies have been remedied, (ii) rescission in the event the Merger is consummated or alternatively rescissory damages and (iii) an award\nof costs, including attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees. ChemoCentryx believes this lawsuit is without merit.\n76Table of Contents\nAdditional lawsuits may be filed against ChemoCentryx, members of the Board or ChemoCentryx\u2019s officers in connection with the Merger, which\ncould prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to ChemoCentryx, including any costs associated with indemnification.",

The\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants, and agreements made in the Merger Agreement by ChemoCentryx and Amgen were qualified and subject to\nimportant limitations agreed to by ChemoCentryx and Amgen in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In particular, in your\nreview of the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is important\nto bear in mind that the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the right to not close the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other\nparty prove to be untrue (or such covenants and agreements were not complied with), due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk\nbetween the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements may\nalso be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the\nSEC, and in some cases were qualified by disclosures contained in the disclosure schedules delivered by ChemoCentryx to Amgen in connection with the\nMerger Agreement (referred to as the \u201cDisclosure Schedules\u201d), which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement.

benefit plan\nto be waived with respect to the covered employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the\napplicable covered employee participated

or her covered\ndependents under the medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of ChemoCentryx prior to the closing of the Merger during the plan year in\nwhich the closing of the Merger

and his or her covered dependents for such plan year under any\nmedical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plan of the surviving corporation, Amgen or its affiliates, as if such amounts had

policies with a claims reporting or discovery\nperiod of six years from the Effective Time. In each case, such policies must have terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less\nfavorable than those contained in ChemoCentryx\u2019s existing directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies in effect as of August 3, 2022, with respect to\nmatters arising on or before the Effective Time. However, in no event will Amgen or the surviving corporation be required to expend for such policies an\naggregate premium\n95\nTable of Contents\namount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium amount currently paid or payable by ChemoCentryx with respect to its existing directors\u2019 and\nofficers\u2019 insurance policies as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement. If the aggregate premium amount of such insurance coverage cannot be\nobtained at an annual premium equal to or less than such amount, the surviving corporation is required to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage\navailable for a cost not exceeding such amount. From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the surviving corporation is\nrequired to maintain in effect, and Amgen will cause the surviving corporation to maintain in effect, such directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 tail policy.\nFinancing Covenants\nReceipt of Financing\nAmgen\u2019s receipt of financing is not a condition to the consummation of the Merger.
