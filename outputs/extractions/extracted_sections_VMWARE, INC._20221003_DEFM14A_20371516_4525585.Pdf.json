            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nThe following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the\ntransactions, the merger agreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all\nquestions that may be important to you as a VMware stockholder. Please refer to the section titled \u201cSummary\u201d and\nthe more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, the annexes to this proxy\nstatement/prospectus and the documents referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus, which you should read\ncarefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus without charge by following the instructions under the section titled \u201cWhere You Can Find\nMore Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?\nA:\nVMware, Inc. (referred to as VMware) is sending these materials to VMware stockholders to help them decide\nhow to vote their shares of VMware common stock with respect to (i) the adoption of the Agreement and Plan of\nMerger, dated as of May 26, 2022, by and among Broadcom Inc. (referred to as Broadcom), VMware, Verona\nHoldco, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of VMware (referred to as Holdco), Verona Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Holdco (referred to as Merger Sub 1), Barcelona Merger Sub 2, Inc., a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Broadcom (referred to as Merger Sub 2) and Barcelona Merger Sub 3, LLC, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Broadcom (referred to as Merger Sub 3, and collectively, with Merger Sub 2, as Broadcom Merger\nSubs), which agreement provides for the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom (such agreement, as it may be\namended from time to time, is referred to as the merger agreement), a copy of which is included as Annex A to\nthis proxy statement/prospectus, and approval of the first merger and the second merger (each as defined\nbelow), (ii) the adoption of an amendment to VMware\u2019s certificate of incorporation (referred to as the charter\namendment) to eliminate the personal liability of VMware\u2019s officers for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary\nduty as an officer, except to the extent such an exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by\nthe General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (referred to as the DGCL) and (iii) the other proposals to be\nconsidered at the special meeting of VMware stockholders to be held on November 4, 2022 (referred to as the\nspecial meeting).\nThis document constitutes both a proxy statement of VMware and a prospectus of Broadcom. It is a proxy\nstatement because VMware is soliciting proxies from its stockholders. It is a prospectus because Broadcom will\nissue shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (referred to as Broadcom common stock), in\nexchange for shares of VMware Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (referred to as VMware\ncommon stock or VMware shares) in the transactions (as defined below) if the transactions are completed.\nQ:\nWhat are the transactions?\nA:\nVMware has agreed to be acquired by Broadcom under the terms of the merger agreement, which is further\ndescribed in this proxy statement/prospectus. If the merger agreement is adopted by VMware stockholders and\nthe other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, the following transactions\n(collectively referred to as the transactions) will be consummated:\n\u2022\nMerger Sub 1 will merge with and into VMware (referred to as the first merger), with VMware surviving the\nfirst merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the effective time of the first merger, VMware, the surviving company of the first merger, will be\nconverted into a Delaware limited liability company (referred to as the LLC conversion)\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the effective time of the LLC conversion, Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into Holdco (referred\nto as the second merger), with Holdco surviving the second merger and becoming a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Broadcom\u037e and\n\u2022\nfollowing the effective time of the second merger, Holdco, the surviving company of the second merger, will\nmerge with and into Merger Sub 3 (referred to as the third merger), with Merger Sub 3 surviving the third\nmerger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom.\n1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nAre there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the merger\nagreement proposal?\nA:\nYes. You should read and carefully consider the risks set forth in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on\npage 27. You should also read and carefully consider the risks related to Broadcom and VMware contained in the\ndocuments that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive for my shares if the transactions are completed?\nA:\nImmediately prior to the effective time of the second merger, the merger consideration is subject to proration so\nthat 50% of VMware common stock issued and outstanding will be converted into cash consideration and 50%\nwill be converted into stock consideration.\nAt the effective time of the second merger, you will be entitled to receive, at your election and subject to\nproration, for each share of VMware common stock that you hold (i) $142.50 in cash, without interest (referred to\nas the cash consideration) or (ii) 0.25200 shares of Broadcom common stock (referred to as the stock\nconsideration and together with the cash consideration, the merger consideration). You will receive cash in lieu\nof any fractional shares of Broadcom common stock that you would otherwise be entitled to receive.\nYou may elect a different form of merger consideration for each share you own. You may elect to receive (i)\nsolely the cash consideration, (ii) solely the stock consideration or (iii) if you own more than one share, a\ncombination of the cash consideration for a selected number of shares and the stock consideration for the\nremaining number of shares. Whether you receive your elected merger consideration will depend on the election\nof other VMware stockholders and a proration mechanism. For example, if you elect to receive solely the cash\nconsideration or solely the stock consideration, and all other VMware stockholders make the same election, the\nconsideration you receive will vary to the maximum extent possible compared to your original election. In such\ninstance, you would receive the cash consideration in exchange for 50% of your shares of VMware common\nstock and the stock consideration in exchange for 50% of your shares of VMware common stock. The following\nexamples illustrate the proration mechanism in the case of an oversubscription of either the cash consideration\nor the stock consideration (both if you elect solely the oversubscribed form of merger consideration and if you\nelect a combination of the cash consideration and the stock consideration). Note that for illustrative purposes,\nthe following examples do not round shares to the nearest whole number.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the cash consideration, and\n80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect\nto receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,\nyou will receive cash in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common\nstock in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 55 shares\nand the stock consideration for 45 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive\ncash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the\noutstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 34.375 of your\nshares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 65.625 of your shares of\nVMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the stock consideration, and\n80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding\nVMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,\nyou will receive cash in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common\nstock in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 45 shares\nand the stock consideration for 55 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive\nBroadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the\noutstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 65.625 of your\nshares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 34.375 of your shares of\nVMware common stock.\n2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe proration of the merger consideration will not be known until immediately prior to or following the effective\ntime of the second merger. VMware stockholders who do not make an election will be treated as having elected\nto receive cash consideration or stock consideration in accordance with the proration methodology in the\nmerger agreement.\nOn May 25, 2022 (the last full trading day before the announcement of the transactions), the closing stock price\nper share of Broadcom common stock was $531.63, which, after giving effect to the exchange ratio of 0.25200,\nhas an implied value of approximately $133.97 per share. Based on this price, with respect to the stock\nconsideration and the cash consideration of $142.50 per share, upon completion of the transactions, VMware\nstockholders that receive the cash consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock and receive\nthe stock consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock would receive total merger\nconsideration with an implied value of approximately $138.24 per share.\nOn September 30, 2022 (the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus),\nthe closing stock price per share of Broadcom common stock was $444.01, which, after giving effect to the\nexchange ratio of 0.25200, has an implied value of approximately $111.89 per share. Based on this price, with\nrespect to the stock consideration and the cash consideration of $142.50 per share, upon completion of the\ntransactions, VMware stockholders that receive the cash consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware\ncommon stock and receive the stock consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock would\nreceive total merger consideration with an implied value of approximately $127.20 per share.\nThe implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Broadcom common stock\nfluctuates because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Broadcom common stock.\nAs a result, the value of the stock consideration that VMware stockholders will receive upon completion of the\ntransactions could be greater than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the date of\nthis proxy statement/prospectus, at the time of the VMware special meeting or on the date on which VMware\nstockholders make their election. Accordingly, you should obtain current stock price quotations for Broadcom\ncommon stock and VMware common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to the merger agreement\nproposal. Broadcom common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cAVGO\u201d and\nVMware common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cVMW.\u201d\nFor additional information regarding the consideration to be received in the transactions, see the section titled\n\u201cThe Transactions-Merger Consideration.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat happens if I am eligible to receive a fraction of a share of Broadcom common stock as part of the stock\nconsideration?\nA:\nIf the aggregate number of shares of Broadcom common stock that you are entitled to receive as part of the\nstock consideration otherwise would include a fraction of a share of Broadcom common stock, you will receive\ncash in lieu of that fractional share. See the section titled \u201cThe Transactions-Exchange of Shares\u037e Elections as to\nForm of Consideration.\u201d\nQ:\nHow and when do I make my merger consideration election?\nA:\nYou will receive an election form following the VMware special meeting. You will make your cash and/or stock\nelection by properly completing, signing and returning the election form. In addition, if you hold stock\ncertificates representing VMware common stock, you must return your stock certificates (or guaranty of delivery\nof such certificates) to the exchange agent in connection with the transactions. If you do not send in the\nelection form with such stock certificates, if applicable, by the election deadline, you will be treated as though\nyou had not made an election. Carefully review and follow the instructions accompanying the election form. If\nyou own VMware common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish\nto make an election, you should follow the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee\nwhen making your election.\nThe mailing of the election form will occur at least 20 business days prior to the anticipated election deadline,\nwhich is expected to be 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the\n3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexchange agent is located) on the date that is five business days prior to Broadcom\u2019s good faith estimate of the\nclosing date or such other date as may be mutually agreed to by the parties. Broadcom and VMware will publicly\nannounce the anticipated election deadline at least three business days prior to the election deadline.\nDo NOT submit any stock certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) with your proxy card.\nFor more details on the election procedures, see \u201cThe Transactions-Exchange of Shares\u037e Elections as to Form of\nConsideration.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat do I do if I want to revoke my election?\nA:\nYou may change or revoke your election at any time during the election period, by written notice to the exchange\nagent prior to the election deadline or by withdrawal of your VMware stock certificates (or of the guarantee of\ndelivery of such stock certificates), if applicable, previously deposited with the exchange agent prior to the\nelection deadline.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not make a valid merger consideration election?\nA:\nIf you do not return a properly completed election form by the election deadline, your shares of VMware\ncommon stock will be considered \u201cnon-election\u201d shares and will be converted into the right to receive the cash\nconsideration or the stock consideration according to the allocation procedures specified in the merger\nagreement. Generally, in the event one form of merger consideration (i.e., cash or shares of Broadcom common\nstock) is undersubscribed (referred to as the undersubscribed consideration), \u201cnon-election\u201d shares will be\nallocated the undersubscribed consideration.\nQ:\nIf I make a valid merger consideration election, could I receive a form of merger consideration that I did not\nelect to receive?\nA:\nIf, after the \u201cnon-election\u201d shares have been allocated any undersubscribed consideration, there still remains\nundersubscribed consideration, then shares of VMware common stock electing the oversubscribed form of\nmerger consideration will be allocated the undersubscribed consideration pursuant to the proration and\nadjustment procedures. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that you will receive your elected form of merger\nconsideration for all of your shares of VMware common stock. In the event proration is necessary, electing\nshares will be allocated the undersubscribed consideration only after the undersubscribed consideration is\nallocated to \u201cnon-election\u201d shares.\nQ:\nHow will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled?\nA:\nAfter receiving the proper documentation from you, following the completion of the second merger, the\nexchange agent will provide to you the cash consideration and/or stock consideration to which you are entitled.\nMore information on the documentation you are required to deliver to the exchange agent may be found in the\nsection titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment Procedures.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat will happen to VMware as a result of the transactions?\nA:\nIf the transactions are completed, VMware, as the surviving corporation of the first merger, will be converted to a\nlimited liability company in the LLC conversion and will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of\nBroadcom as a result of the second merger. As a result of the transactions, VMware will no longer be a publicly\nheld company and VMware common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered\nunder the Exchange Act.\nQ:\nWhat are the closing conditions that must be satisfied to complete the transactions and can the parties waive\nthe closing conditions?\nA:\nThere are a number of conditions to the closing of the transactions. For a summary of the conditions that must\nbe satisfied or waived prior to the consummation of the transactions, see the section titled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Conditions to the Transactions.\u201d The closing conditions can be waived by the applicable parties to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law, but no party is required to waive any closing conditions.\n4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf the parties were to waive any closing conditions-such as the condition that: (i) the shares of Broadcom\ncommon stock to be issued to VMware stockholders in the second merger be approved for listing on The\nNasdaq Global Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance, (ii) the representations and warranties of\nVMware and Broadcom must be true and correct as of the closing, subject to certain materiality or material\nadverse effect qualifiers, or (iii) no material adverse effect has occurred on the other party that is continuing-\nsuch waiver may have an adverse effect on VMware and Broadcom and their respective stockholders. For a\nsummary of the potential risks relating to the transactions, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Relating to\nthe Transactions.\u201d\nQ:\nWhen are the transactions expected to be completed?\nA:\nBroadcom and VMware currently expect the transactions to be completed during Broadcom\u2019s fiscal year 2023,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common\nstock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement, the expiration or termination of the waiting period (and any\nextensions thereof) applicable to the transactions under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of\n1976, as amended (referred to as the HSR Act), the receipt of the clearances and approvals applicable to the\ntransactions under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions, and the satisfaction\nor waiver of the other closing conditions contained in the merger agreement. However, Broadcom and VMware\ncannot predict the actual date on which the transactions will be completed because completion is subject to\nconditions beyond their control and it is possible that such conditions could result in the transactions being\ncompleted earlier or later or not being completed at all. See the sections titled \u201cThe Transactions-Regulatory\nClearances and Approvals Required for the Transactions\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the\nTransactions.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat am I being asked to vote on?\nA:\nYou are being asked to vote upon the following proposals:\n1.\nProposal 1-The Merger Agreement Proposal: the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is\nfurther described in the sections titled \u201cThe Transactions\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u201d and a copy of\nwhich is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, and to approve the first merger and the\nsecond merger\u037e\n2.\nProposal 2-The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal: the proposal to approve on an advisory (non-\nbinding) basis the compensation that may be paid or become payable to VMware\u2019s named executive\nofficers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions\u037e\n3.\nProposal 3-The Adjournment Proposal: the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if\nnecessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement\nproposal\u037e and\n4\nProposal 4-The Charter Amendment Proposal: the proposal to approve and adopt the charter\namendment, which is further described in the section titled \u201cProposal 4: The Charter Amendment Proposal,\u201d\nand the full text of which is set forth in the proposed Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of\nVMware (with additions shown as underlined and deletions shown as struck through), which is attached to\nthis proxy statement/prospectus as Annex G.\nQ:\nHow does the VMware board of directors recommend that I vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nThe VMware board of directors unanimously recommends that VMware stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger\nagreement proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the charter amendment proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d each of the other proposals described\nin this proxy statement/prospectus.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, please\nsubmit your proxy as soon as possible so that your shares of VMware common stock will be represented and\nvoted at the special meeting. Please follow the instructions set forth on the proxy card or on the voting\ninstruction card provided by the record holder if your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your bank, brokerage\nfirm or other nominee.\n5\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nShould I send in my VMware stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. Please do not send in your VMware stock certificates with your proxy. You should submit your VMware\nstock certificates with your election form. If a VMware stockholder who holds VMware common stock in\ncertificated form does not submit its, his or her stock certificate(s) with the election form, such VMware\nstockholder will be sent materials after the transactions close to effect the exchange of such stockholder\u2019s\nVMware common stock for the merger consideration. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment\nProcedures.\u201d\nQ:\nWhen and where is the special meeting of the VMware stockholders?\nA:\nThe special meeting will be held on November 4, 2022, beginning at 8:30 a.m., Pacific time, unless postponed to a\nlater date, via live audio webcast at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VMW2022SM. You will need the 16-\ndigit control number provided on your proxy card or voting instruction card in order to participate in the special\nmeeting.\nQ:\nWho can vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nOnly VMware stockholders who held shares of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2022, the\nrecord date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. VMware\u2019s\nofficial stock ownership records will conclusively determine whether a stockholder is a \u201cholder of record\u201d as of\nthe record date.\nQ:\nHow many votes do I have?\nA:\nYou are entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the special meeting for each share of\nVMware common stock you hold or beneficially own as of the close of business on the record date. As of the\nclose of business on the record date, there were 424,475,071 shares of VMware common stock outstanding and\nowned by stockholders (i.e., excluding shares of VMware common stock held in treasury by VMware) held by\n3,779 holders of record.\nQ:\nWhat constitutes a quorum for the special meeting?\nA:\nThe presence of holders of shares representing at least a majority of the total outstanding shares of VMware\ncommon stock on the record date entitled to vote at the special meeting, represented virtually or by proxy,\nconstitute a quorum. Stockholders choosing to abstain from voting and broker \u201cnon-votes\u201d will be treated as\npresent for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but will not be counted as votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d\nany matter.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve each proposal to be considered at the VMware special meeting?\nA:\nThe votes required for each proposal are as follows:\n1.\nProposal 1-The Merger Agreement Proposal: The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of holders of at\nleast a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock entitled to vote on the merger\nagreement proposal is required to approve the merger agreement proposal.\n2.\nProposal 2-The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal: The affirmative vote of holders of at least a\nmajority of the shares of VMware common stock represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy,\nand entitled to vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is required to approve, on an advisory\n(non-binding) basis, the merger-related compensation proposal.\n3.\nProposal 3-The Adjournment Proposal: The affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the shares\nof VMware common stock represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy, and entitled to vote on\nthe adjournment proposal is required to approve the adjournment proposal.\n4.\nProposal 4-The Charter Amendment Proposal: The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of holders of at\nleast 67% of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock entitled to vote on the charter amendment\nproposal is required to approve the charter amendment proposal.\n6\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs of September 30, 2022, the record date, VMware directors and executive officers, as a group, owned and were\nentitled to vote 169,663,338 shares of VMware common stock, or approximately 40.0% of the outstanding shares\nof VMware common stock. VMware currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote their\nshares in favor of the merger agreement proposal and each of the other proposals described in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, although none of them are obligated to do so, other than Michael S. Dell with respect to\nthe merger agreement proposal and the adjournment proposal.\nConcurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of (i) Michael S. Dell (the current chairman and a\nmember of the VMware board of directors) and Susan Lieberman Dell Separate Property Trust (together with\nMichael S. Dell referred to as the MSD stockholders) and (ii) Silver Lake Partners IV, L.P., Silver Lake Technology\nInvestors IV, L.P., Silver Lake Partners V DE (AIV), L.P., Silver Lake Technology Investors V, L.P., SL SPV-2, L.P.\nand Silver Lake Group, L.L.C.

VMware encourages you to read the merger agreement carefully and in\nits entirety, as it is the legal document that governs the transactions.\nThe merger agreement provides that, through a series of transactions including the first merger and the second\nmerger, VMware will become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with Delaware law:\n\u2022\nMerger Sub 1 will merge with and into VMware (referred to as the first merger), with VMware surviving the\nfirst merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the effective time of the first merger, VMware, the surviving company of the first merger, will be\nconverted (referred to as the LLC conversion) into a Delaware limited liability company\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the effective time of the LLC conversion, Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into Holdco (referred\nto as the second merger), with Holdco surviving the second merger and becoming a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Broadcom\u037e and\n\u2022\nfollowing the effective time of the second merger, Holdco, the surviving company of the second merger, will\nmerge with and into Merger Sub 3 (referred to as the third merger), with Merger Sub 3 surviving the third\nmerger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom.\n12\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSet forth below is a diagram depicting the structure of the first merger and the LLC conversion described under\nthe first and second bullet points above.\n\u202f\n*\nCircled entities are disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSet forth below is a diagram depicting the structure of the second merger and the third merger described under\nthe third and fourth bullet points above.\n\u202f\n*\nCircled entities are disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe first merger, the second merger, the third merger and the LLC conversion are collectively referred to as the\ntransactions. The parties chose the structure described and depicted above to enable the transactions to qualify for\nthe Intended Tax Treatment (as defined below), and to preserve VMware as a corporate entity in Broadcom\u2019s\ncorporate structure following the closing of the transactions.\nAt the effective time of the first merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately\nprior to the effective time of the first merger will be converted into one share of common stock of Holdco, and each\noutstanding VMware equity award will be converted into a Holdco award that relates to a number of shares of\nHoldco common stock that is equal to the number of shares of VMware common stock that were subject to such\naward prior to such conversion.\nFor more information, see the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Effects of the Transactions.\u201d\nMerger Consideration (see page 50)\nAt the effective time of the second merger, each issued and outstanding share of VMware common stock (other than\nshares (i) owned or held in treasury by VMware or by Merger Sub 2 or in the treasury of VMware as the surviving\ncompany in the first merger (referred to as cancelled shares), (ii) owned by stockholders that did not vote in favor of\nthe adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the first merger and the second merger and have validly made a\ndemand for appraisal and not validly withdrawn such demand or otherwise lost their rights of appraisal with respect\nto such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (referred to as dissenting shares) and (iii) owned by any wholly\nowned subsidiary of VMware (referred to as excluded shares)) will be converted into the right to receive, at the\nelection of the holder of such share and subject to proration, $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.25200 of a share of\nBroadcom common stock. No fractional shares of Broadcom common stock will be issued in the second merger, and\nholders of VMware common stock will instead receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom common stock.\nThe merger consideration is subject to proration so that 50% of VMware common stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the second merger will be converted into cash consideration and 50% will be\nconverted into stock consideration. A holder of VMware common stock may elect to receive (i) solely the cash\nconsideration, (ii) solely the stock consideration or (iii) if the holder of VMware common stock owns more than one\nshare, a combination of the cash consideration for a selected number of shares and the stock consideration for the\nremaining number of shares. The election will be subject to the election of other holders of VMware common stock\nand a proration mechanism. For example, if you elect to receive solely the cash consideration or solely the stock\nconsideration, and all other VMware stockholders make the same election, the consideration you receive will vary to\nthe maximum extent possible compared to your original election. In such instance, you would receive the cash\nconsideration in exchange for 50% of your shares of VMware common stock and the stock consideration in exchange\nfor 50% of your shares of VMware common stock. The following examples illustrate the proration mechanism in the\ncase of an oversubscription of either the cash consideration or the stock consideration (both if you elect solely the\noversubscribed form of merger consideration and if you elect a combination of the cash consideration and the stock\nconsideration). Note that for illustrative purposes, the following examples do not round shares to the nearest whole\nnumber.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the cash consideration, and\n80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect\nto receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,\nyou will receive cash in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common\nstock in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 55 shares\nand the stock consideration for 45 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive\ncash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the\noutstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 34.375 of your\nshares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 65.625 of your shares of\nVMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the stock consideration, and\n80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock, 15% of the\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\noutstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make\nan election, you will receive cash in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and\nBroadcom common stock in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 45 shares\nand the stock consideration for 55 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive\nBroadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the\noutstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 65.625 of your\nshares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 34.375 of your shares of\nVMware common stock.\nA holder of VMware common stock who does not make an election will be treated as having elected to receive cash\nconsideration or stock consideration in accordance with the proration methodology in the merger agreement, which is\ndescribed in the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Effect of the Transactions-Proration and Allocation of Merger\nConsideration.\u201d\nOn May 25, 2022 (the last full trading day before the announcement of the transactions), the closing stock price per\nshare of Broadcom common stock was $531.63, which, after giving effect to the exchange ratio of 0.25200, has an\nimplied value of approximately $133.97 per share. Based on this price, with respect to the stock consideration and the\ncash consideration of $142.50 per share, upon completion of the transactions, VMware stockholders that receive the\ncash consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock and receive the stock consideration for 50% of\ntheir shares of VMware common stock would receive total merger consideration with an implied value of\napproximately $138.24 per share.\nOn September 30, 2022 (the most recent practicable date prior to the date prior to the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus), the closing stock price per share of Broadcom common stock was $444.01, which, after giving\neffect to the exchange ratio of 0.25200, has an implied value of approximately $111.89 per share. Based on this price,\nwith respect to the stock consideration and the cash consideration of $142.50 per share, upon completion of the\ntransactions, VMware stockholders that receive the cash consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common\nstock and receive the stock consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock would receive total\nmerger consideration with an implied value of approximately $127.20 per share.\nThe implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Broadcom common stock fluctuates\nbecause the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Broadcom common stock. As a result, the\nvalue of the stock consideration that VMware stockholders will receive upon completion of the second merger could\nbe greater than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, at the time of the VMware special meeting or on the date on which VMware stockholders make\ntheir election. Accordingly, Broadcom and VMware encourage you to obtain current stock price quotations for\nBroadcom common stock and VMware common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to the merger\nagreement proposal. Broadcom common stock and VMware common stock trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market\nand the New York Stock Exchange, respectively, under the symbols \u201cAVGO\u201d and \u201cVMW,\u201d respectively.\nVMware Special Meeting (see page 38)\nPurposes of the Special Meeting\nAt the special meeting, VMware stockholders will be asked to vote upon the following proposals:\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe merger-related compensation proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe adjournment proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe charter amendment proposal.\nRecord Date\nThe record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting is\nSeptember 30, 2022 (referred to as the record date).

The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of holders of at\nleast a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock entitled to vote on the merger\nagreement proposal is required to approve the merger agreement proposal.\n\u2022\nProposal 2-The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of holders of at least a\nmajority of the shares of VMware common stock represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy,\nand entitled to vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is required to approve, on an advisory\n(non-binding) basis, the merger-related compensation proposal.\n\u2022\nProposal 3-The Adjournment Proposal. The affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the shares\nof VMware common stock present virtually or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the\nadjournment proposal is required to approve the adjournment proposal.\n\u2022\nProposal 4-The Charter Amendment Proposal. The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of holders of at\nleast 67% of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock entitled to vote on the charter amendment\nproposal is required to approve the charter amendment proposal.\nAs of the record date, VMware directors and executive officers, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote\n169,663,338 shares of VMware common stock, or approximately 40.0% of the outstanding shares of VMware common\nstock. VMware currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of\napproving the merger agreement proposal, the charter amendment proposal and each of the other proposals\ndescribed in this proxy statement/prospectus, although none of them are obligated to do so, other than Michael S.\nDell with respect to the merger agreement proposal and the adjournment proposal.\nConcurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of (i) the MSD stockholders and (ii) the SL\nstockholders have agreed to vote all of the shares of VMware common stock held by them (representing in the\naggregate approximately 49.8% of the total outstanding shares of VMware common stock as of the record date) in\nfavor of the merger agreement proposal, as described in more detail in the section titled \u201cThe Voting Agreements.\u201d\nVMware\u2019s Reasons for the Transactions\u037e Recommendation of the VMware Board of Directors (see page 57)\nAt its May 26, 2022 meeting held to evaluate the transactions, the VMware board of directors unanimously (i)\ndetermined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions are fair to, and in the best interests, of\nVMware and the VMware stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of VMware and the VMware\nstockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement, (iii) approved the execution and delivery\nby VMware of the merger agreement, the performance by VMware of its covenants and agreements contained therein\nand the consummation of the transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger\nagreement and (iv) resolved to recommend that the VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.\nAdditionally, the VMware board of directors has approved, adopted, authorized and declared advisable the charter\namendment.\nThe VMware board of directors unanimously recommends that VMware stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger\nagreement proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the merger-related compensation proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal, and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the charter amendment proposal.\nIn evaluating the transactions and the merger agreement and arriving at its determination, the VMware board of\ndirectors consulted with VMware\u2019s senior management, VMware\u2019s financial advisors, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n(referred to as Goldman Sachs) and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (referred to as J.P. Morgan), and VMware\u2019s outside\nlegal counsel, and considered a number of substantive factors, both positive and negative, and potential benefits and\ndetriments of the transactions to VMware and its stockholders, as described in more detail in the section titled \u201cThe\nTransactions-VMware\u2019s Reasons for the Transactions\u037e Recommendation of the VMware Board of Directors.\u201d\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOpinions of VMware\u2019s Financial Advisors (see page 65)\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs (see page 65)\nGoldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated May 26,\n2022, to the VMware board of directors that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the\nvarious limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to\nthe holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock pursuant to the merger\nagreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated May 26, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is\nattached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion\nfor the information and assistance of the VMware board of directors in connection with its consideration of the\ntransactions. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of VMware common stock\nshould vote with respect to the transactions or any other matter.\nOpinion of J.P. Morgan (see page 73)\nJ.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated May 26, 2022,\nto the VMware board of directors that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the\nvarious limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid to the\nholders of shares of VMware common stock in the transactions was fair from a financial point of view to such\nholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated May 26, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is\nattached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus. J.P. Morgan provided advisory services and its opinion for\nthe information and assistance of the VMware board of directors in connection with its consideration of the\ntransactions. The J.P. Morgan opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of VMware common stock\nshould vote with respect to the transactions or any other matter.\nInterests of VMware\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions (see page 80)\nWhen considering the recommendation of the VMware board of directors with respect to the transactions, you\nshould be aware that VMware\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the transactions that are\ndifferent from, or in addition to, those of VMware stockholders more generally. The VMware board of directors was\naware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger\nagreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions and\nin recommending that VMware stockholders vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal. These interests include,\namong others, the treatment of outstanding VMware equity awards in connection with the transactions and certain\npotential severance payments in connection with the transactions and a qualifying termination of employment upon\nor following the transactions, as described in more detail in the section titled \u201cThe Transactions-Interests of\nVMware\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions.\u201d\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (see page 85)\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, the transactions are intended to be treated as follows: (i) the first merger and\nthe LLC conversion, taken together, are intended to qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a)\n(1)(F) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as the Code) and (ii) the second merger and the\nthird merger, taken together, are intended to qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the\nCode (clauses (i) and (ii) together, collectively referred to as the Intended Tax Treatment). VMware\u2019s obligation to\ncomplete the transactions is conditioned upon the delivery by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, counsel to VMware\n(referred to as Gibson Dunn) (or other nationally recognized tax counsel or Big 4 accounting firm as may be\nreasonably acceptable to VMware), of its opinion that the transactions will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment\n(referred to as the Tax Opinion).\nProvided the transactions qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the\ntransactions to a U.S. holder (as defined in the section titled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nConsequences\u201d) of VMware common stock will depend primarily on whether such holder exchanges its shares of\nVMware common stock solely for shares of Broadcom common stock, solely for cash, or for a combination of shares\nof Broadcom common stock and cash:\n\u2022\nU.S. holders of VMware common stock who exchange their shares of common stock solely for shares of\nBroadcom common stock generally will not recognize gain or loss on the exchange, except with respect to\ncash received in lieu of a fractional share of Broadcom common stock.\n\u2022\nU.S. holders of VMware common stock who exchange their shares of common stock solely for cash\ngenerally will recognize gain or loss on the exchange. Such gain or loss generally will be equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the\nshares of VMware common stock surrendered.\n\u2022\nU.S. holders of VMware common stock who exchange their shares of common stock for a combination of\nshares of Broadcom common stock and cash generally will recognize gain, but not loss, on the exchange. If\nthe sum of the fair market value of the Broadcom common stock and the amount of cash received by a U.S.\nholder in exchange for such holder\u2019s shares of VMware common stock exceeds the tax basis in the shares\nof VMware common stock, such holder generally will recognize taxable gain on the exchange equal to the\nlesser of the amount of such excess and the amount of cash received in the exchange.\nUnder certain circumstances, a holder of shares of VMware common stock could be treated as receiving a dividend in\nan amount up to the cash consideration received by that holder in the transactions. If the applicable withholding\nagent is unable to determine whether such cash consideration should be so treated, a holder of VMware common\nstock that is not a U.S. holder may be subject to United States withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as\nmay be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of cash payable to such holder in the\ntransactions.\nEach VMware stockholder should read the discussion under the section titled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences\u201d and should consult his, her or its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax considerations of the\ntransactions to such holder.\nAccounting Treatment of the Transactions (see page 85)\nThe transactions will be accounted for as a business combination, with Broadcom using the acquisition method of\naccounting in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations, and, accordingly, will\ngenerally result in the recognition of VMware assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. However, as of the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus, the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets\nacquired (including intangible assets, such as completed technology, customer relationships and customer lists, and\ntrademarks and trade names) and liabilities assumed have been performed based on publicly available benchmarking\ninformation as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market participant assumptions, as there are\nlimitations to the type of information that can be exchanged between Broadcom and VMware at this time. Until the\ntransactions are complete, Broadcom will not have complete access to all the relevant information. Differences\nbetween these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur and there can be no assurances\nthat the final valuations will not result in material changes to this preliminary purchase price allocation. The excess of\nthe consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined financial information will be allocated to goodwill. A final determination of these fair values will reflect\nappraisals prepared by independent third-parties and will be based on the actual tangible and intangible assets and\nliabilities that exist as of the acquisition date. The actual allocation of the consideration transferred may differ from\nthe allocation assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and may result in\nadjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\nRegulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Transactions (see pages 89 and 90)\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters. The transactions are subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which\nprevents VMware and Broadcom from completing the transactions until required information and materials are\nfurnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (referred to as the DOJ) and the Federal Trade\nCommission (referred to as the FTC) and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires. VMware and\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBroadcom submitted the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act on June 10, 2022. On July 11, 2022\nVMware and Broadcom each received a request for additional information, often referred to as a \u201csecond request,\u201d\nfrom the FTC under the HSR Act.\nForeign Regulatory Clearances. The completion of the transactions is subject to clearance under the antitrust laws\nof the European Union and certain other jurisdictions, and the parties will file or have filed merger notifications\npursuant to antitrust and competition laws with the appropriate regulators in the European Union and certain other\njurisdictions. The parties must observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary approvals, clearances\nor consents pursuant to certain of these foreign laws before completing the transactions.\nOther state or foreign antitrust, competition and foreign investment authorities may take action under the laws of\ntheir jurisdictions, which could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the transactions. For more information\nabout regulatory approvals relating to the transactions, see the sections titled \u201cThe Transactions-Regulatory\nClearances and Approvals Required for the Transactions\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the\nTransactions.\u201d\nAlthough the parties expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, the parties cannot\nassure you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the\ngranting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the\ncompletion of the transactions, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or\nobligations or enter into supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the\ntransactions not being satisfied.\nExpected Timing of the Transactions\nBroadcom and VMware currently expect the transactions to be completed during Broadcom\u2019s fiscal year 2023, subject\nto the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the adoption of the merger agreement by the\naffirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock, the expiration or\ntermination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the receipt of approvals or clearances required under the\nantitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. However, Broadcom and VMware cannot predict\nthe actual date on which the transactions will be completed because completion is subject to conditions beyond their\ncontrol and it is possible that such conditions could result in the transactions being completed earlier or later or not\nbeing completed at all. See the sections titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Efforts to Obtain Regulatory Approvals\u201d and\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Transactions.\u201d Also, see the section titled \u201cThe Transactions-Regulatory\nClearances and Approvals Required for the Transaction.\u201d\nTreatment of VMware Equity Awards (see pages 101 and 102)\nTreatment of Stock Options\nAt the effective time of the second merger, each outstanding and in-the-money VMware stock option will become\nvested and will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each net option share\nsubject to such stock option, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and 50% of the stock consideration,\nless applicable tax withholding. For this purpose, net option shares are calculated as the number of shares of VMware\ncommon stock having a value equal to the in-the-money value of the stock option based on the value of the merger\nconsideration, with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based on the volume weighted\naverage sale price of Broadcom common stock over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the second to last\ntrading day immediately preceding the effective time of the second merger (referred to as the Broadcom trading price).\nTreatment of Restricted Stock Units\nAt the effective time of the second merger:\n\u2022\neach outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee director will become vested\nand will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each share of VMware\ncommon stock subject to such award, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and 50% of the\nstock consideration\u037e\n20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\neach outstanding time-based VMware restricted stock unit award that is not held by a non-employee\ndirector will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange\nratio calculated as the sum of (i) 50% of the stock consideration and (ii) 50% of the cash consideration\ndivided by the Broadcom trading price\u037e and\n\u2022\neach outstanding performance-based VMware restricted stock unit award will be converted into a\nBroadcom restricted stock unit award using the same formula described in the above bullet, provided that\n(i) for each such award granted under the VMware operating performance stock unit plan, performance\ngoals will be deemed achieved (1) at the actual level with respect to performance periods completed prior to\nthe closing of the transactions, or (2) at target level with respect to performance periods not completed\nprior to the closing of the transactions and (ii) for each such award that was granted under the VMware\ntotal shareholder return (TSR) performance stock unit plan, performance will be measured at the closing of\nthe transactions based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals based on the\nvalue of merger consideration (with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based\non the Broadcom trading price).\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, VMware, the VMware board of directors or the compensation\ncommittee of the VMware board of directors, as applicable, will take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of\nVMware\u2019s employee stock purchase plan, as amended (referred to as the ESPP), to terminate the ESPP effective as of\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the second merger, contingent upon the occurrence of the second merger,\nand to provide that, (i) no offering or purchase period will be continued or commenced under the ESPP, except for any\noffering or purchase period under VMware\u2019s ESPP that was in effect on the date of the merger agreement (referred to\nas the current ESPP offering period)\u037e (ii) no new participants may elect to participate in the ESPP during the current\nESPP offering period\u037e and (iii) no participant may increase the participant\u2019s payroll deductions with respect to the\ncurrent ESPP offering period. The final exercise date under the current ESPP offering period shall be the earlier of (A)\nthe normal exercise date for the current ESPP offering period and (B) five business days prior to the effective time of\nthe second merger (such earlier date is referred to as the final exercise date). Each ESPP participant\u2019s accumulated\ncontributions under the ESPP will be used to purchase shares of VMware common stock in accordance with the terms\nof the ESPP as of the final exercise date, which shares will be treated in accordance with the terms of the merger\nagreement, and as promptly as practicable following the purchase of such shares in accordance with this sentence,\nVMware will return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such participant\u2019s account after such\npurchase.\nListing of Broadcom Common Stock\u037e Delisting of VMware Common Stock (see page 93)\nIt is a condition to the consummation of the transactions that the shares of Broadcom common stock to be issued to\nVMware stockholders in the second merger be approved for listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to\nofficial notice of issuance. As a result of the second merger, shares of VMware common stock will cease to be listed\non the New York Stock Exchange.\nAppraisal Rights of VMware Stockholders (see page 160)\nVMware stockholders who do not vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement proposal, who continuously\nhold their shares of Holdco common stock received in connection with the first merger through the effective time of\nthe second merger and who otherwise comply precisely with the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL\nwill be entitled to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of VMware common stock, as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, if the second merger is completed. The \u201cfair value\u201d of your shares of VMware common\nstock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of\nthe merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement.\nVMware stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares must so advise VMware by\nsubmitting a written demand for appraisal in the form described in this proxy statement/prospectus prior to the vote\nto approve the merger agreement proposal, and must otherwise follow the procedures prescribed by Section 262 of\nthe DGCL. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of VMware common stock held of record in the name of\nanother person, such as a nominee or intermediary, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps\nsummarized in this proxy statement/prospectus and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights.\n21\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex F to this proxy statement/prospectus. You are encouraged\nto read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising\nappraisal rights, VMware stockholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice\nof legal counsel and their financial advisors. Failure to strictly comply with these provisions may result in the loss of\nappraisal rights.\nGo Shop\u037e No Solicitation of Other Offers by VMware (see page 110)\nThe merger agreement provides that from the date thereof until 11:59 p.m. Pacific time, on July 5, 2022 (referred to as\nthe no-shop period start date), VMware and its subsidiaries and their respective representatives may solicit,\nencourage or facilitate any acquisition proposal and any proposal, inquiry or offer that could be reasonably expected\nto lead to, result in or constitute an acquisition proposal, including providing information regarding VMware to any\nperson pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, and engaging in discussions or negotiations with\nrespect to such acquisition proposal.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, from and after the no-shop period start date and except as permitted under\nthe prior paragraph, VMware has agreed not to solicit, encourage or facilitate any competing acquisition proposals\nfor VMware, enter into discussions or negotiations with any third parties regarding any competing acquisition\nproposals for VMware or enter into any agreements with a third party regarding any competing acquisition proposals\nfor VMware.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, from and following the no-shop period start date, if VMware receives an\nunsolicited competing acquisition proposal, prior to VMware stockholders adopting the merger agreement at the\nspecial meeting, that the VMware board determines to be superior to the transactions or reasonably be expected to\nlead to a proposal that is superior to the transactions, subject to certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement,\nVMware is permitted to engage in discussions and negotiations with the party that sent the competing acquisition\nproposal (and its representatives, advisors and financing sources) and furnish non-public information to that party\n(and its representatives, advisors and debt financing sources).\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement and subject to certain conditions set forth therein (including the payment of\na $1.5 billion termination fee or $750 million termination fee, as applicable), prior to VMware stockholders adopting the\nmerger agreement at the special meeting, VMware may terminate the merger agreement to accept a competing\nacquisition proposal that the VMware board of directors has determined to be superior to the transactions from a\nfinancial point of view. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Go Shop\u037e No Solicitation of Other Offers by VMware\u201d and \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Change of Recommendation\u037e Match Rights.\u201d\nLitigation Relating to the Transactions (see page 92)\nIn connection with the transactions, five complaints have been filed as individual actions in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York and one complaint has been filed as an individual action in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaints are captioned as follows: (1) Stein v.\nVMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-06307 (filed July 25, 2022)\u037e (2) O\u2019Dell v.

VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-7735 (filed September 11, 2022) (collectively referred to as the Complaints).\nThe Complaints generally allege that this proxy statement/prospectus misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly\nmaterial information. The Complaints assert violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9\npromulgated thereunder against VMware and the members of the VMware board of directors. The Complaints seek,\namong other things, an injunction enjoining the consummation of the transactions, direction that a registration\nstatement is disseminated, including certain additional information, rescission or rescissory damages in the event the\ntransactions are consummated\u037e declaration that defendants violated Section 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act,\nas well as SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder\u037e direction that defendants account for all damages suffered as a\nresult of any misconduct\u037e costs of the action, including plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and experts\u2019 fees\u037e and other relief\nthe court may deem just and proper. In\n22\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naddition to the Complaints, beginning on July 20, 2022, certain purported stockholders of VMware sent demand\nletters (referred to as the Demands, and together with the Complaints, the Matters) alleging similar deficiencies\nregarding the disclosures made in this proxy statement/prospectus, and seek additional disclosures to address those\npurported deficiencies.\nVMware cannot predict the outcomes of the Matters. VMware management believes that the Matters are without\nmerit and intends to vigorously defend against the Matters and any subsequent similar demands or filed actions. If\nadditional similar complaints are filed or demands sent, absent new or significantly different allegations, VMware will\nnot necessarily disclose such additional filings or demands.\nConditions to the Transactions (see page 117)\nThe respective obligations of VMware, Holdco, Merger Sub 1, Broadcom and Broadcom Merger Subs to consummate\nthe transactions are subject to the satisfaction (or waiver if permitted under the merger agreement) of customary\nconditions, including the adoption of the merger agreement by VMware\u2019s stockholders by the affirmative vote of at\nleast a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock, the expiration or termination of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act and the receipt of approvals or clearances required under the antitrust laws of the\nEuropean Union and certain other jurisdictions.\nThe obligations of Broadcom and Broadcom Merger Subs to consummate the transactions are also subject to the\nabsence of a VMware material adverse effect (as defined in the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-\nRepresentations and Warranties\u201d) after the date of the merger agreement that is continuing, the accuracy of VMware,\nHoldco and Merger Sub 1 representations and warranties and compliance by VMware, Holdco and Merger Sub 1 with\nits obligations and agreements under the merger agreement, as described in the section titled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Representations and Warranties.\u201d\nThe merger agreement does not include a financing condition.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the parties are required to close the transactions on the third business day\nfollowing the date on which the closing conditions to the transactions are satisfied. However, if the closing date\nwould occur within 35 days of the end of Broadcom\u2019s fiscal year or any other fiscal quarter, Broadcom may, upon\nwritten notice to VMware, choose to defer the closing of the transactions to the first business day of its next fiscal\nyear or fiscal quarter, respectively (or to another date agreed to between VMware and Broadcom). See the section\ntitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Closing\u037e Effective Time.\u201d\nTermination of the Merger Agreement (see page 120)\nAmong other customary circumstances, Broadcom or VMware may terminate the merger agreement if:\n\u2022\nany governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction,\ndecree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining

the merger agreement is terminated in certain\ncircumstances including VMware entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, an adverse\nrecommendation change or a willful breach in a material respect of VMware\u2019s non-solicitation obligations under the\nmerger agreement, unless VMware terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with\nrespect to a superior proposal prior to the no-shop period start date, in which case VMware will be required to pay\nBroadcom a lower termination fee in the amount of $750 million.\nBroadcom must pay VMware a termination fee of $1.5 billion if the merger agreement is terminated in certain\ncircumstances including as a result of certain required regulatory clearances not being obtained by the outside date.\nAll other expenses relating to the transactions will generally be paid by the party incurring the expense.\nComparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of Broadcom and VMware (see page 143)\nUpon the completion of the transactions, VMware stockholders receiving shares of Broadcom common stock will\nbecome stockholders of Broadcom, and their rights will be governed by the governing corporate documents of\nBroadcom in effect at the effective time of the second merger, which are different from VMware\u2019s governing corporate\ndocuments, as further described in the section titled \u201c-Comparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of Broadcom\nand VMware.\u201d\nCharter Amendment (see page 46)\nVMware is asking its stockholders to approve the charter amendment,

            "text": "RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus,\nincluding, among other things, the matters addressed in the section titled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements,\u201d VMware stockholders should carefully consider the following risks before deciding\nwhether to vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal and the other proposals described in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. In addition, VMware stockholders should read and consider the risks associated with each\nof the businesses of Broadcom and VMware because these risks will relate to Broadcom following the completion of\nthe transactions. Descriptions of some of these risks can be found in Broadcom\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 and VMware\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 28, 2022 and, in each case, any amendments thereto, as such risk factors may be updated or supplemented\nin each company\u2019s subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are\nincorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. You should also consider the other information in\nthis proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. See the section titled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nRisks Relating to the Transactions\nBecause the stock election exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted for stock price changes and the\nmarket price of Broadcom common stock has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, VMware stockholders\ncannot be sure of the value of the consideration they will receive.\nUpon completion of the second merger, each issued and outstanding share of VMware common stock (other than (i)\ncancelled shares, (ii) dissenting shares and (iii) excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive, at the\nelection of the stockholder and subject to proration, $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.25200 of a share of\nBroadcom common stock. Each VMware stockholder may elect to receive (i) solely the cash consideration, (ii) solely\nthe stock consideration or (iii) if the VMware stockholder owns more than one share, a combination of the cash\nconsideration for a selected number of shares and the stock consideration for the remaining number of shares.\nThe market price of Broadcom common stock at the time of completion of the transactions may vary significantly from\nthe market price of Broadcom common stock on the date the merger agreement was executed, the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, the date of the VMware special meeting and the date on which VMware stockholders make\ntheir election. Because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Broadcom common stock, the\nvalue of the stock consideration that VMware stockholders receive upon completion of the transactions may be\nhigher or lower than the value of the stock consideration on such earlier dates. In addition, as discussed below, the\nmerger consideration will be subject to proration. Accordingly, VMware stockholders will not know or be able to\ncalculate at the time of the VMware special meeting the market value of the stock consideration they will receive upon\ncompletion of the transactions.\nIf a VMware stockholder makes a stock election and the market value of Broadcom common stock falls between the\ntime of the election and the time the merger consideration is actually received, the value of the merger consideration\nreceived may be less than the value of the merger consideration such stockholder would have received under a cash\nelection. Conversely, if a VMware stockholder makes a cash election and the market value of Broadcom common\nstock rises between the time of the election and the time the merger consideration is actually received, the value of\nthe merger consideration received may be less than the value of the merger consideration such stockholder would\nhave received under a stock election. Additionally, the consideration received by VMware stockholders may be\nsubject to proration, such that a VMware stockholder that makes a cash election may receive stock consideration for\nsome of their shares of VMware common stock, the value of which will be subject to the uncertainty described above.\nStock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic\nconditions, changes in Broadcom\u2019s and VMware\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, market\nassessments of the likelihood that the transactions will be completed, the timing of the transactions, regulatory\nconsiderations and other risk factors set forth or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. Many\nof these factors are beyond Broadcom\u2019s and VMware\u2019s control. VMware stockholders are urged to obtain current\nmarket quotations for Broadcom common stock and VMware common stock when they make their elections.\n27TABLE OF CONTENTS\nVMware stockholders may not receive all consideration in the form they elect, and the form of consideration that\nthey receive may have a lower value or different tax consequences than the form of consideration that they elect\nto receive.\nVMware stockholders\u2019 consideration will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware\ncommon stock entitled to receive the cash consideration and the total number of shares of VMware common stock\nentitled to receive the stock consideration, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of\nVMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger.\nAccordingly, some of the merger consideration a VMware stockholder receives may differ from the type of\nconsideration selected and such difference may be significant. This may result in, among other things, tax\nconsequences that differ from those that would have resulted if the VMware stockholder had received solely the form\nof consideration elected. A discussion of the proration mechanism can be found under the section titled \u201cThe\nTransactions-Merger Consideration\u201d and a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the\ntransactions can be found under the section titled \u201cThe Transactions-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences.\u201d\nCompletion of the transactions is subject to the conditions contained in the merger agreement and if these\nconditions are not satisfied or waived, the transactions will not be completed.\nThe obligations of Broadcom and VMware to complete the transactions are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a\nnumber of conditions, including, among others, the adoption of the merger agreement by VMware\u2019s stockholders by\nthe affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock, the expiration or\ntermination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the receipt of approvals or clearances required under the\nantitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. For a more complete summary of the required\nregulatory approvals and the closing conditions, see the sections titled \u201cThe Transactions-Regulatory Clearances\nand Approvals for the Transactions\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Transactions.\u201d\nAlthough Broadcom and VMware have agreed in the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to\ncomplete the transactions as promptly as practicable, many of the closing conditions are not within Broadcom\u2019s or\nVMware\u2019s control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these\nconditions are not satisfied or waived prior to February 26, 2023, which deadline may be extended to November 26,\n2023 under certain circumstances, it is possible that the merger agreement will be terminated. The failure to satisfy all\nof the required conditions could delay the completion of the transactions for a significant period of time or prevent it\nfrom occurring. Any delay in completing the transactions could cause Broadcom not to realize some or all of the\nbenefits that it expects to achieve if the transactions are successfully completed within their expected timeframe.\nThere can be no assurance that the closing conditions will be satisfied or waived or that the transactions will be\ncompleted. See the risk factor titled \u201c-Failure to complete the transactions could negatively affect the stock price and\nthe future business and financial results of VMware,\u201d below.\nIn the event that the parties determine to waive any of the conditions to the closing of the transactions, such\ndecision may have an adverse effect on Broadcom and VMware and their respective stockholders. For example, if\nBroadcom and VMware waive the condition that the shares of Broadcom common stock to be issued to VMware\nstockholders in the second merger must be approved for listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and close the\ntransactions, the shares of Broadcom common stock issued to VMware stockholders at the closing would not be\nlisted on a stock exchange until The Nasdaq Global Select Market has approved the listing application, and the ability\nof VMware stockholders to trade such shares would be adversely affected. By way of further example, if VMware\nwaives the condition that there be no material adverse effect on Broadcom that has occurred and is continuing, the\nvalue of the consideration received by VMware stockholders could be materially diminished.\nIn addition, upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, including the termination by\neither party because certain required regulatory clearances either are not obtained before the outside date or are\ndenied, Broadcom would be required to pay VMware a reverse termination fee of $1.5 billion. For additional\ninformation, see the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fee and Expenses.\u201d\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe transactions are subject to the expiration of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of approvals,\nconsents or clearances from regulatory authorities in the United States, the European Union and certain other\njurisdictions that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on Broadcom, VMware or following\nthe completion of the transactions, Broadcom or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the transactions.\nBefore the transactions may be completed, any waiting period (or extension thereof) applicable to the transactions\nmust have expired or been terminated, and any approvals, consents or clearances required in connection with the\ntransactions must have been obtained, in each case, under the HSR Act and under the antitrust laws of the European\nUnion and certain other jurisdictions. In addition, the transactions may be reviewed under antitrust statutes or\nforeign direct investment regimes of other governmental authorities, including U.S. state laws. In deciding whether to\ngrant the required regulatory approval, consent or clearance, the relevant governmental entities will consider the\neffect of the transactions on competition within their relevant jurisdiction.\neffect of the transactions on competition within their relevant jurisdiction.\nThe terms and conditions of the approvals, consents and clearances that are granted may impose requirements,\nlimitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of Broadcom\u2019s business following the completion of the\ntransactions. Under the merger agreement, Broadcom and VMware have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to\nobtain such approvals, consents and clearances and therefore may be required to comply with conditions, terms,\nobligations or restrictions imposed by governmental authorities. There can be no assurance that such conditions,\nterms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the transactions or imposing\nadditional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of Broadcom following the completion of the\ntransactions. In addition, neither Broadcom nor VMware can provide assurance that any such conditions, terms,\nobligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the transactions. See the sections titled \u201cThe\nTransactions-Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Transactions\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement-\nConditions to the Transactions.\u201d\nThe transactions could cause VMware\u2019s spin-off from Dell Technologies, Inc. to become a taxable transaction,\nwhich would result in material indemnification obligations on the part of VMware (which, following the\nconsummation of the transactions, will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Broadcom).\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, an acquisition of a corporation that was a distributing or controlled\ncorporation in a spin-off intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code can render the\nspin-off taxable to the distributing corporation and, if applicable, its shareholders if such acquisition is deemed to\noccur pursuant to a \u201cplan\u201d that includes the spin-off or violates the \u201cdevice\u201d prohibition. The tax matters agreement\n(referred to as the tax matters agreement) entered into by Dell Technologies, Inc. (referred to as Dell), VMware and\ncertain other parties in connection with VMware\u2019s spin-off from Dell in 2021 (referred to as the VMware spin-off),\ngoverns VMware\u2019s and Dell\u2019s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities\n(including taxes, if any, resulting from a failure of the VMware spin-off to qualify as a tax-free transaction under\nSection 355 of the Code) and benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and\nother tax proceedings, cooperation with respect to the tax matters and other matters regarding taxes.\nThe tax matters agreement generally provides that VMware is responsible for any taxes imposed on Dell or any of its\naffiliates (or any of its shareholders that are required to be paid or reimbursed by Dell or any of its affiliates) resulting\nfrom a failure of the VMware spin-off to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code if such failure\nis attributable to acquisitions of VMware stock or assets, issuances of stock by VMware, changes in ownership of\nVMware stock and certain other specified actions or omissions by VMware, in each case, following the VMware spin-\noff. In addition, the tax matters agreement prohibits VMware from taking certain actions (including sales of\nsubstantially all of the assets of VMware, mergers involving VMware and certain acquisitions of VMware stock)\nduring the two-year period following the VMware spin-off, unless VMware provides Dell with an opinion of counsel\nor Internal Revenue Service (referred to as the IRS) private letter ruling confirming that such action will not cause the\nVMware spin-off to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code.\nIn connection with the execution of the merger agreement, VMware provided Dell with an opinion from Gibson Dunn,\ncounsel to VMware, to the effect that the transactions will not result in the VMware spin-off failing to qualify as a tax-\nfree transaction under Section 355 of the Code. Moreover, the merger agreement includes a representation by\nVMware to Broadcom that such opinion has not been revoked, substantively modified or withdrawn (unless an\nacceptable replacement opinion has been received), and Broadcom\u2019s obligation to consummate the transactions is\nconditioned on such representation being true and correct in all respects as of\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe date of the merger agreement and as of the closing of the transactions, as though made on and as of the closing\nof the transactions. Broadcom may, in its sole discretion, waive the condition relating to the accuracy of this\nrepresentation. If (i) there were a breach of VMware\u2019s representation regarding the opinion, (ii) Broadcom were to\nwaive the condition relating to the accuracy thereof, and (iii) VMware did not obtain an IRS private letter ruling\nconfirming that the transactions will not cause the VMware spin-off to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction under\nSection 355 of the Code, Dell could seek to enjoin the consummation of the transactions. The opinion of Gibson\nDunn is based on, among other things, various assumptions and the accuracy of representations made by VMware,\nBroadcom, Dell and certain other persons in connection with the VMware spin-off and the execution of the merger\nagreement. If any of these assumptions or representations were, or were to become, inaccurate or incomplete, the\nopinion may be invalid. No ruling from the IRS is being sought regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe transactions, and an opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, there can be no\nassurance that the IRS will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions in the opinion of counsel or that a\ncourt will not sustain such a challenge.\nRegardless of whether the condition in the merger agreement relating to the accuracy of VMware\u2019s representation\nregarding the opinion required by the tax matters agreement is satisfied or waived by Broadcom, if the VMware spin-\noff were determined to be taxable as a result of the transactions, Dell, its affiliates and, potentially, its stockholders\nwould incur significant tax liabilities and, under the tax matters agreement, VMware (which, following the\nconsummation of the transactions, will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Broadcom) may be required to indemnify\nDell and its affiliates for any such tax liabilities, which would be material.\nVMware\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the transactions and the charter amendment that may\nbe different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder of VMware more generally.\nWhen considering the recommendation of the VMware board of directors that VMware stockholders approve the\nmerger agreement proposal, the merger-related compensation proposal and the charter amendment proposal, VMware\nstockholders should be aware that directors and executive officers of VMware have certain interests in the\ntransactions and the charter amendment proposal that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of\nVMware stockholders more generally. With respect to the merger agreement proposal and the merger-related\ncompensation proposal, these interests generally include, among others, treatment of outstanding VMware equity\nawards in connection with the transactions and certain potential severance payments in connection with the\ntransactions and a qualifying termination of employment upon or following the transactions. See the section titled\n\u201cThe Transactions- Interests of VMware\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions\u201d for a more detailed\ndescription of these interests. With respect to the charter amendment proposal, these interests include the\nprotections afforded by the charter amendment with respect to the elimination of personal liability of VMware\u2019s\nofficers for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as an officer, except to the extent such an exemption from\nliability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL. The VMware board of directors was aware of these\ninterests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the charter amendment and in evaluating and\nnegotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the consummation of\nthe transactions, and in recommending that VMware stockholders vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal.\nThe merger agreement limits VMware\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the transactions and may discourage\nother companies from trying to acquire VMware.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for VMware to sell its business to a party other\nthan Broadcom. These provisions include a general prohibition on VMware soliciting any company takeover\nproposal or offer for a competing transaction following the expiration of the go-shop period, which expired on July 5,\n2022. In addition, upon termination of the merger agreement, VMware is required to pay Broadcom a termination fee\nof $1.5 billion if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances including VMware entering into a\ndefinitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, an adverse recommendation change or a willful breach in a\nmaterial respect of VMware\u2019s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement.\nAlthough the go-shop provision was intended to provide VMware the ability to conduct a reasonable market check\non the adequacy of the merger consideration payable to VMware stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement, it is\npossible that the go-shop provision, the no-shop provision or the other provisions of the merger agreement could\ndiscourage a potential acquiror that might have had an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of VMware from\nconsidering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nper share cash or market value than the consideration Broadcom proposes to pay in the transactions or might result\nin a potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire VMware than it might otherwise\nhave proposed to pay because of the termination fee that may become payable to Broadcom in certain circumstances\ndescribed in the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fee and Expenses.\u201d\nThe merger agreement subjects VMware to restrictions on its business activities.\nThe merger agreement subjects VMware to restrictions on its business activities and obligates VMware to generally\nconduct its business in a commercially reasonable manner and in all material respects in the ordinary course of\nbusiness consistent with past practice. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on VMware\u2019s results of\noperations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe business relationships of Broadcom and VMware and their respective subsidiaries may be subject to\ndisruption due to uncertainty associated with the transactions, which could have an adverse effect on the results\nof operations, cash flows and financial position of Broadcom, VMware and, following the completion of the\ntransactions, Broadcom.\nParties with which Broadcom and VMware, or their respective subsidiaries, do business may be uncertain as to the\neffects the transactions may have on them, including with respect to current or future business relationships with\nBroadcom, VMware or their respective subsidiaries. These relationships may be subject to disruption as customers,\nsuppliers and other persons with whom Broadcom and VMware have a business relationship may delay or defer\ncertain business decisions or might decide to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with Broadcom or\nVMware, as applicable, or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than Broadcom, VMware\nor their respective subsidiaries. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash\nflows and financial position of Broadcom or VMware, including an adverse effect on Broadcom\u2019s ability to realize the\nexpected synergies and other benefits of the transactions. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be\nexacerbated by a delay in completion of the transactions or termination of the merger agreement.\nFailure to complete the transactions could negatively affect the stock price and the future business and financial\nresults of VMware.\nIf the transactions are not completed for any reason, including as a result of VMware stockholders failing to approve\nthe merger agreement proposal, the ongoing business of VMware may be adversely affected and, without realizing\nany of the benefits of having completed the transactions, VMware could be subject to a number of negative\nconsequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nVMware may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its\nstock price\u037e\n\u2022\nVMware may experience negative reactions from its customers and suppliers\u037e\n\u2022\nVMware may experience negative reactions from its employees and may not be able to retain key\nmanagement personnel and other key employees\u037e\n\u2022\nVMware will have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant non-recurring costs in connection with\nthe transactions that it may be unable to recover\u037e\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of VMware\u2019s business prior to completion\nof the transactions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Broadcom (not to be unreasonably\nwithheld, conditioned or delayed), which may prevent VMware from making certain acquisitions, taking\ncertain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the\ntransactions that may be beneficial to VMware (see the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conduct of\nBusinesses of VMware and Broadcom Prior to Completion of the Transactions\u201d for a description of the\nrestrictive covenants applicable to VMware)\u037e and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the transactions (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of\ntime and resources by VMware management, which could otherwise be devoted to day-to-day operations\nand other opportunities that may be beneficial to VMware as an independent company.\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, upon termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, VMware is required to pay\nBroadcom a termination fee of $1.5 billion, including VMware entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a\nsuperior proposal, an adverse recommendation change or a willful breach in a material respect of VMware\u2019s non-\nsolicitation obligations under the merger agreement. Finally, VMware could be subject to litigation related to any\nfailure to complete the transactions or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against VMware to perform\nits obligations under the merger agreement. If the transactions are not completed, any of these risks may materialize\nand may adversely affect VMware\u2019s businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nBroadcom expects to obtain financing in connection with the transactions and cannot guarantee that it will be\nable to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all.\nBroadcom anticipates that the funds needed to complete the transactions will be derived from a combination of (i)\navailable cash on hand and (ii) third-party debt financing. See \u201cThe Transactions-Financing of the Transactions\u201d for\nadditional information regarding the anticipated financing of the transactions. Broadcom\u2019s ability to obtain any such\nnew debt financing will depend on, among other factors, prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond\nBroadcom\u2019s control. Broadcom cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain new debt financing on terms\nacceptable to it or at all, and any such failure could materially adversely affect its operations and financial condition.\nBroadcom\u2019s obligation to complete the transactions is not conditioned upon the receipt of any financing.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus\nis preliminary and the actual financial condition and results of operations after the transactions may differ\nmaterially from them.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus is\npresented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what Broadcom\u2019s actual financial\ncondition or results of operations would have been had the transactions been completed on the dates indicated. The\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects adjustments, which are based upon\nassumptions, preliminary estimates and accounting reclassifications, to record the VMware identifiable assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation\nreflected in this proxy statement/prospectus is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based\nupon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of VMware as of the date of the\ncompletion of the transactions. Accordingly, the final accounting adjustments as a result of the acquisition may differ\nmaterially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see the\nsection titled \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.\u201d\nCompletion of the transactions may trigger change in control provisions in certain agreements to which VMware\nis a party.\nThe completion of the transactions may trigger change in control provisions in certain agreements to which VMware\nis a party. If VMware and Broadcom are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may\nexercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary\ndamages. Even if VMware and Broadcom are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such\nwaivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to VMware or Broadcom.\nLawsuits have been filed against VMware and its directors, and additional lawsuits may be filed in the future\nagainst VMware, its directors, Broadcom, Holdco, Merger Sub 1 and/or Broadcom Merger Subs challenging the\ntransactions or any one of them, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent completing the\ntransactions or completing the transactions within the expected timeframe and/or result in substantial costs to\nBroadcom and VMware.\nIn connection with the transactions, litigation has been filed against VMware and its board of directors. Among other\nremedies, the plaintiffs in these lawsuits seek damages or to enjoin the transactions. The outcome of any litigation is\nuncertain and any such lawsuits could prevent or delay the completion of the transactions and result in substantial\ncosts to Broadcom and VMware. Any such actions may create uncertainty relating to the\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntransactions and may be costly and distracting to management. Further, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or\nclaim that remains unresolved at the time the transactions are completed may adversely affect Broadcom\u2019s business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For more information, see \u201cThe Transactions-Litigation Relating to the\nTransactions.\u201d\nIt is possible that additional litigation against VMware, its directors, Broadcom, Holdco, Merger Sub 1 and/or\nBroadcom Merger Subs may be filed in the future as securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often\nbrought against public companies that have entered into acquisition, merger or other business combination\nagreements like the merger agreement. Even if such a lawsuit is without merit, defending against these claims can\nresult in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary\ndamages, which could have a negative impact on Broadcom\u2019s and VMware\u2019s respective liquidity and financial\ncondition.\nFurther, one of the conditions to the completion of the transactions is that no injunction or law by any governmental\nentity of competent jurisdiction will be in effect that has the effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting\nthe consummation of the transactions. As such, if an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the transactions is\nobtained, that injunction may prevent the transactions from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the\nexpected timeframe.\nRisks Relating to Broadcom Following Completion of the Transactions\nFailure to realize the benefits expected from the transactions could adversely affect the value of Broadcom\ncommon stock.\nAlthough Broadcom expects significant benefits to result from the transactions, there can be no assurance that\nBroadcom will actually realize any of them, or realize them within the anticipated timeframe. Achieving these benefits\nwill depend, in part, on Broadcom\u2019s ability to integrate VMware\u2019s business successfully and efficiently. The\nchallenges involved with the transactions, which will be complex and time consuming, include the following:\n\u2022\npreserving customer and other important relationships of VMware and attracting new business and\noperational relationships\u037e\n\u2022\nintegrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles\u037e\n\u2022\nconsolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and administrative\ninfrastructures\u037e\n\u2022\ncoordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position Broadcom\u2019s capabilities\u037e\n\u2022\ncoordinating and integrating operations in countries in which Broadcom has not previously operated\u037e and\n\u2022\nintegrating employees and related HR systems and benefits, maintaining employee morale and retaining key\nemployees.\nIf these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business are not successfully managed,\nthen Broadcom may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions on Broadcom\u2019s anticipated timeframe or\nat all, and Broadcom\u2019s revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially\nadversely affected. The successful completion of the transactions will require significant management attention both\nbefore and after the transactions, and may divert the attention of management from Broadcom\u2019s business and\noperational issues.\nAfter the transactions, VMware stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in\nBroadcom than they currently have in VMware and will exercise less influence over management.\nBased on the number of shares of VMware common stock outstanding as of September 12, 2022, and the number of\nshares of Broadcom common stock outstanding as of September 12, 2022, it is expected that, immediately after\ncompletion of the transactions, former VMware stockholders will own approximately 12.6% of the outstanding shares\nof Broadcom common stock. Consequently, former VMware stockholders will have less influence over the\nmanagement and policies of Broadcom than they currently have over the management and policies of VMware.\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe shares of Broadcom common stock have rights different from the shares of VMware common stock.\nAs a result of the transactions, VMware stockholders will no longer be stockholders of VMware. Former VMware\nstockholders who receive stock consideration in the second merger will become Broadcom stockholders, and their\nrights as stockholders will be governed by the terms of Broadcom\u2019s governing corporate documents. See the section\ntitled \u201cComparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of Broadcom and VMware\u201d for a discussion of the different\nrights associated with Broadcom common stock.\nBroadcom and VMware will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the transactions.\nBroadcom and VMware will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the\ntransactions. Following completion of the transactions, Broadcom expects to incur additional expenses in connection\nwith the integration of VMware\u2019s business. Broadcom may incur additional costs or suffer loss of business under\nthird-party contracts that are terminated or that contain change in control or other provisions that may be triggered\nby the completion of the transactions, and/or losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers, and may also incur\ncosts to maintain employee morale and to retain certain key management personnel and employees. Broadcom and\nVMware will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans, and the execution of these\nplans may lead to additional unanticipated costs and time delays. These incremental transaction-related costs may\nexceed the cost synergies Broadcom expects to achieve, particularly in the near term. Factors beyond Broadcom\u2019s\ncontrol could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses, many of which, by their nature, are difficult to\nestimate accurately. See \u201cFailure to realize the benefits expected from the transactions could adversely affect the\nvalue of Broadcom\u2019s common stock\u201d for additional integration risks.\nUncertainties associated with the transactions may cause a loss of management personnel and other key\nemployees of Broadcom or VMware, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of\nBroadcom following the transactions.\nBroadcom and VMware are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key\nemployees to execute their business plans. Broadcom\u2019s success after the transactions will depend in part upon its\nability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of Broadcom and VMware. Current and\nprospective employees of Broadcom and VMware may be uncertain about their future roles with Broadcom following\nthe transactions, which may materially adversely affect the ability of each of Broadcom and VMware to attract and\nretain key personnel during the pendency of the transactions. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Broadcom\nwill be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of Broadcom and VMware.\nThe market price of Broadcom common stock after the transactions are completed may be affected by factors\ndifferent from those affecting shares of VMware common stock before the transactions are completed.\nUpon completion of the transactions, certain holders of VMware common stock will become holders of Broadcom\ncommon stock. Broadcom\u2019s business differs in important respects from that of VMware, and accordingly, the market\nprice of Broadcom common stock after the completion of the transactions may be affected by factors different from\nthose currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Broadcom and VMware. As a result, the\nmarket price of Broadcom common stock may fluctuate significantly following completion of the transactions and\nholders of VMware common stock could lose the value of their investment in Broadcom common stock. For a\ndiscussion of the businesses of Broadcom and VMware and of some important factors to consider in connection with\nthose businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus and referred to\nunder \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d In addition, if former VMware stockholders sell substantial amounts\nof Broadcom common stock in the public market following consummation of the transactions, this could decrease the\nmarket price of Broadcom common stock.\nIn connection with the transactions, Broadcom will incur new indebtedness. Broadcom\u2019s substantial indebtedness\ncould adversely affect Broadcom\u2019s financial health and its ability to execute its business strategy.\nBroadcom\u2019s aggregate indebtedness as of September 12, 2022 was approximately $41.2 billion (excluding finance\nleases). Broadcom\u2019s pro forma indebtedness as of September 12, 2022, after giving effect to the transactions and the\nanticipated incurrence of indebtedness in connection therewith, will be as much as $82.5 billion (excluding finance\nleases).\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBroadcom\u2019s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including:\n\u2022\nincreasing its vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions\u037e\n\u2022\nexposing it to interest rate risk due to its variable rate term facilities, which Broadcom does not typically\nhedge against\u037e\n\u2022\nlimiting its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor\nindustry\u037e\n\u2022\nplacing Broadcom at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors with less indebtedness\u037e\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working\ncapital, capital expenditures and other purposes\u037e and\n\u2022\npotentially requiring Broadcom to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to\npayments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund its other business\nneeds.\nBroadcom receives debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact its credit\nratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth\nopportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be\nconsidered by the rating agencies. While Broadcom is focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these\nagencies, it may be unable to do so. Any downgrade in Broadcom\u2019s credit rating or the ratings of its indebtedness, or\nadverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the trading price of, or market for, its debt securities\u037e\n\u2022\nincrease interest expense under its term facilities\u037e\n\u2022\nincrease the cost of, and adversely affect its ability to refinance, its existing debt\u037e and\n\u2022\nadversely affect its ability to raise additional debt.\nCertain of the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the transactions may bear interest at variable interest\nrates. If interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely\naffect Broadcom\u2019s cash flows.\nOther Risks of Broadcom and VMware\nBroadcom\u2019s and VMware\u2019s businesses are and will be subject to the risks described above. In addition, Broadcom\nand VMware are, and will continue to be, subject to the risks described in Broadcom\u2019s Annual Report for the fiscal\nyear ended October 31, 2021 and VMware\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022,\nas updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed\nwith the SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The risks described above and in\nthose filings represent all known material risks with respect to Broadcom\u2019s and VMware\u2019s businesses.

VMware stockholders who vote this way should mail the proxy card early enough\nso that it is received before the date of the special meeting.\n\u2022\nTo Vote Virtually at the Special Meeting: To vote virtually at the special meeting, visit\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VMW2022SM and enter the 16-digit control number included on your\nproxy card or voting instruction card that accompanied your proxy materials.\nWhether or not you plan to participate in the special meeting, VMware urges you to submit your proxy by completing\nand returning the proxy card as promptly as possible, or by submitting your proxy by telephone or via the Internet,\nprior to the special meeting to ensure that your shares of VMware common stock will be represented and voted at the\nspecial meeting if you are unable to participate.\nThe VMware board of directors has appointed certain persons as proxy holders to vote proxies in accordance with\nthe instructions of VMware stockholders. If you are a stockholder of record and you authorize\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthese proxy holders to vote your shares of VMware common stock with respect to any matter to be acted upon, your\nshares will be voted in accordance with your instructions in your proxy. If you are a stockholder of record and you\nauthorize these proxy holders to vote your shares but do not specify how your shares should be voted on a\nproposal, these proxy holders will vote your shares on such proposals as the VMware board of directors\nrecommends, except if you indicate that you wish to vote against the merger agreement proposal, in which case your\nshares of VMware common stock will only be voted in favor of the merger-related compensation proposal, the\nadjournment proposal and the charter amendment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of such\nproposals. If any other matter properly comes before the special meeting, these proxy holders will vote on that matter\nin their discretion.\nIf, as of the record date, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock\nTransfer and Trust Company, LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the\nproxy notice was sent directly to you by VMware. If, as of the record date, your shares were held in an account at a\nbank, brokerage firm or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d\nand the proxy notice was forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is\nconsidered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the special meeting. As a beneficial owner, you must\ndirect your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to vote the shares of VMware common stock held in your\naccount and you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee describing how to vote\nyour shares of VMware common stock. The availability of Internet or telephonic voting will depend on the nominee\u2019s\nvoting process. Please check with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and follow the voting procedures your\nbank, brokerage firm or other nominee provides.\nIf you are a beneficial owner and do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee instructions on how to\nvote your shares of VMware common stock with respect to \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters, a broker \u201cnon-vote\u201d occurs with\nrespect to those matters. Under applicable stock exchange rules, the organization that holds your shares of VMware\ncommon stock (i.e., your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee) may generally vote on routine matters at its\ndiscretion but cannot vote your shares on \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters without your instructions. If you are a beneficial\nowner and the organization that holds your shares of VMware common stock does not receive instructions from you\non how to vote your shares of VMware common stock on a non-routine matter, the organization that holds your\nshares of VMware common stock will inform the inspector of elections that it does not have the authority to vote\nyour shares on such matters. The merger agreement proposal, the merger-related compensation proposal, the\nadjournment proposal and the charter amendment proposal will be considered \u201cnon-routine.\u201d Accordingly, if you are\na beneficial owner and do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee instructions on how to vote your\nshares of VMware common stock, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee generally will not be permitted to vote\nyour shares on any of the proposals. If you are a beneficial holder, VMware strongly encourages you to provide\nvoting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee so that your vote will be counted on all matters.\nIf you are a beneficial owner, you are invited to participate in the special meeting\u037e however, you may not vote your\nshares at the special meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that\nholds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the special meeting.\nRevocation of Proxies\nVMware stockholders of record may revoke their proxies at any time prior to the voting at the special meeting in any\nof the following ways:\n\u2022\nsigning and delivering a new proxy relating to the same shares and bearing a later date than the original\nproxy\u037e\n\u2022\nsending a signed, written notice of revocation, which is dated later than the date of the proxy and states\nthat the proxy is revoked, to Attention: Secretary, VMware, Inc. Legal Department, 3401 Hillview Avenue,\nPalo Alto, California 94304\u037e or\n\u2022\nparticipating in and voting during the virtual special meeting. Participation in the virtual special meeting will\nnot, however, in and of itself, constitute a vote or revocation of a prior proxy.\nVMware beneficial owners may change their voting instruction only by following the directions received from their\nbank, brokerage firm or other nominee for changing their voting instructions.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSolicitation of Proxies\nVMware will pay for the proxy solicitation costs related to the special meeting. In addition to sending and making\navailable these materials, some of VMware\u2019s directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies in person by\ncontacting VMware stockholders by telephone or over the Internet. VMware stockholders may also be solicited by\npress releases issued by VMware, postings on VMware\u2019s websites and advertisements in periodicals. None of\nVMware\u2019s directors, officers or employees will receive additional compensation for their solicitation services.\nVMware has engaged D.F. King to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. VMware estimates that\nit will pay D.F. King a fee of approximately $17,500, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Certain banking\ninstitutions, brokerage firms, custodians, trustees, nominees and fiduciaries who hold shares for the benefit of\nanother party may solicit proxies for VMware. If so, they will mail proxy information to, or otherwise communicate\nwith, the beneficial owners of shares of VMware common stock held by them. VMware will also reimburse banks,\nbrokerage firms, custodians, trustees, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses incurred in sending proxies and\nproxy materials to beneficial owners of VMware common stock.\nAdjournments\nThe special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting or the holders of shares representing at least a\nmajority of the votes entitled to be cast by VMware stockholders present virtually or represented by proxy, if\nsufficient votes are cast in favor of the adjournment proposal, whether or not there is a quorum.\nNotice need not be given of any adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote\ncommunications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present and vote at such\nadjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for\nmore than 30 days, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record\nentitled to vote at the meeting. If, after any adjournment, a new record date for the stockholders entitled to vote is\nfixed for any adjourned meeting, notice of the place, if any, date, and time of the adjourned meeting and the means of\nremote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present and vote at\nsuch adjourned meeting must be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.\nQuestions and Additional Information\nYou may contact VMware\u2019s proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., 48 Wall Street, 22nd Floor, New York, New York\n10005, with any questions about the special meeting, the transactions, the proposals or this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, if you would like additional copies of the proxy statement/prospectus, if you need to obtain\nproxy cards or other information related to the proxy solicitation or if you need help submitting a proxy or voting your\nshares of VMware common stock.

The effect of\nthe charter amendment is to limit the ability of VMware\u2019s stockholders to seek monetary damages directly against\nVMware\u2019s officers. However, this provision does not limit VMware\u2019s rights or the rights of any VMware stockholder\nto seek monetary damages against an officer for a breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or\nwhich involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, transactions in which an officer derives an\nimproper personal benefit, or any actions brought by VMware directly against the officer or by any of VMware\u2019s\nstockholders through a derivative suit on VMware\u2019s behalf. If the charter amendment is adopted, VMware\u2019s officers\nthat would be subject to this provision include its chief executive officer, president, chief operating officer, chief\nfinancial officer, chief legal officer, chief accounting officer, its most highly compensated executive officers as\nidentified in its SEC filings and certain other officers who have consented (or are deemed to have consented) to\nservice by the delivery of process to VMware\u2019s registered agent in accordance with Delaware law. If the charter\namendment is adopted, it will not eliminate or limit the liability of an officer for any act or omission occurring prior to\nthe date on which it becomes effective.\nWhen considering the recommendation of the VMware board of directors that VMware stockholders approve the\ncharter amendment proposal, VMware stockholders should be aware that directors and executive officers of VMware\nhave certain interests in the charter amendment proposal that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of\nVMware stockholders more generally. Specifically, Raghu Raghuram, a member of VMware\u2019s board of directors and\nthe chief executive officer of VMware, as well as certain other officers of VMware, will receive the liability exculpation\nprotections afforded by the charter amendment if it is adopted by VMware\u2019s stockholders. The VMware board of\ndirectors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching its decision to approve\nthe charter amendment.\nThe VMware board of directors has approved, adopted, authorized and declared advisable the charter amendment\nproposal. The foregoing description of the charter amendment proposal should be read in connection with the full\ntext of the charter amendment, which is set forth in the proposed Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\nof VMware (with additions shown as underlined and deletions shown as struck through), which is attached as Annex\nG to this proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the charter amendment carefully and in its entirety.\nThe vote on the charter amendment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger agreement\nproposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the charter\namendment proposal and vice versa.\nThe affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of the holders of at least 67% of the outstanding shares of VMware\ncommon stock entitled to vote on the charter amendment proposal is required to approve and adopt the charter\namendment proposal. If the charter amendment proposal is approved and adopted by the VMware stockholders at\nthe special meeting, VMware intends to file the proposed Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\nattached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex G with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware promptly\nfollowing the conclusion of the special meeting.\nTHE VMWARE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT VMWARE STOCKHOLDERS\nVOTE \u201cFOR\u201d THE CHARTER AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.\n46TABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE TRANSACTIONS",

After the\nconsummation of the first merger, all references in this proxy statement/prospectus to VMware, including VMware\ncommon stock, VMware stock options, VMware restricted stock unit awards, VMware equity awards and other\nsecurities of VMware will be deemed, where applicable, to be references to Holdco and the same securities of Holdco,\nand all references to VMware stockholders will be deemed to be references to common stockholders of Holdco.\nImmediately after the consummation of the first merger, VMware will be converted into a Delaware limited liability\ncompany (referred to as the LLC conversion) and will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco.\n47TABLE OF CONTENTS\nSet forth below is a diagram depicting the structure of the first merger and the LLC conversion.\n\u202f\n*\nCircled entities are disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSecond Merger\nFollowing completion of the first merger and LLC conversion, Merger Sub 2 will, on the closing date, merge with and\ninto Holdco (referred to as the second merger). Holdco will be the surviving company in the second merger and will\nbecome a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom.\nThird Merger\nFollowing completion of the second merger, Holdco will, on the closing date, merge with and into Merger Sub 3\n(referred to as the third merger). Merger Sub 3 will be the surviving limited liability company in the third merger and\nwill be a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom.\nIn this proxy statement/prospectus, we refer to the first merger, the second merger, the third merger and the LLC\nconversion collectively as the transactions.\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSet forth below is a diagram depicting the structure of the second merger and the third merger.\n\u202f\n*\nCircled entities are disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe parties chose the structure described and depicted above to enable the transactions to qualify for the Intended\nTax Treatment, and to preserve VMware as a corporate entity in Broadcom\u2019s corporate structure following the closing\nof the transactions.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMerger Consideration\nUpon completion of the second merger, each issued and outstanding share of VMware common stock (other than (i)\ncancelled shares, (ii) dissenting shares and (iii) excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive, at the\nelection of the holder of such share and subject to proration, $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.25200 of a share of\nBroadcom common stock. VMware stockholder may elect a different form of consideration for each share such\nVMware stockholder owns. VMware stockholders may elect to receive (i) solely the cash consideration, (ii) solely the\nstock consideration or (iii) if VMware stockholders own more than one share, a combination of the cash\nconsideration for a selected number of shares and the stock consideration for the remaining number of shares. No\nfractional shares of Broadcom common stock will be issued in the second merger, and holders of VMware common\nstock will instead receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom common stock.\nThe merger consideration is subject to proration so that 50% of VMware common stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the second merger will be converted into cash consideration and 50% will be\nconverted into stock consideration, based on an exchange ratio of 0.25200 of a share of Broadcom common stock. For\nexample, if you elect to receive solely the cash consideration or solely the stock consideration, and all other VMware\nstockholders make the same election, the consideration you receive will vary to the maximum extent possible\ncompared to your original election. In such instance, you would receive the cash consideration in exchange for 50%\nof your shares of VMware common stock and the stock consideration in exchange for 50% of your shares of VMware\ncommon stock. The following examples illustrate the proration mechanism in the case of an oversubscription of either\nthe cash consideration or the stock consideration (both if you elect solely the oversubscribed form of merger\nconsideration and if you elect a combination of the cash consideration and the stock consideration). Note that for\nillustrative purposes, the following examples do not round shares to the nearest whole number.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the cash consideration, and\n80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect\nto receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,\nyou will receive cash in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common\nstock in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 55 shares\nand the stock consideration for 45 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware share select to receive\ncash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the\noutstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 34.375 of your\nshares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 65.625 of your shares of\nVMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the stock consideration, and\n80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding\nVMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,\nyou will receive cash in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common\nstock in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 45 shares\nand the stock consideration for 55 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive\nBroadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the\noutstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 65.625 of your\nshares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 34.375 of your shares of\nVMware common stock.\nHolders of VMware common stock who do not make an election will be treated as having elected to receive cash\nconsideration or stock consideration in accordance with the proration methodology in the merger agreement.\nBased on the number of shares of VMware common stock outstanding as of September 12, 2022, plus shares of\nVMware common stock that may be delivered pursuant to unvested equity awards and equity awards that may be\nissued through the completion of the second merger, Broadcom would issue up to approximately 58,548,216 shares of\nBroadcom common stock to VMware stockholders pursuant to the second merger. The actual number of shares of\nBroadcom common stock to be issued pursuant to the second merger will be\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndetermined at completion of the second merger based on the exchange ratio and the number of shares of VMware\ncommon stock outstanding at such time. Based on up to 58,548,216 shares of Broadcom common stock that may be\nissued to VMware stockholders, and the number of shares of Broadcom common stock outstanding as of September\n12, 2022, immediately after completion of the second merger, former VMware stockholders would own approximately\n12.6% of the outstanding shares of Broadcom common stock.\nOn September 30, 2022 (the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus), the\nclosing stock price per share of Broadcom common stock was $444.01, which, after giving effect to the exchange ratio\nof 0.25200, has an implied value of approximately $111.89 per share. Based on this price, with respect to the stock\nconsideration and the cash consideration of $142.50 per share, upon completion of the transactions, VMware\nstockholders that receive the cash consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock and receive the\nstock consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock would receive total merger consideration with\nan implied value of approximately $127.20 per share.\nThe implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate, however, as the market price of Broadcom common stock\nfluctuates because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Broadcom common stock. As a\nresult, the value of the stock consideration that VMware stockholders will receive upon completion of the second\nmerger could be greater than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, at the time of the VMware special meeting or on the date on which VMware stockholders make\ntheir election. Accordingly, VMware and Broadcom encourage you to obtain current stock price quotations for\nBroadcom common stock and VMware common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to approval of the\nmerger agreement proposal.\nBackground of the Transactions\nVMware\u2019s senior management and the VMware board of directors regularly review VMware\u2019s performance, strategy,\ncompetitive position, opportunities and prospects in light of current business and economic environments and\ndevelopments in the software industry and the opportunities and challenges facing participants in the industry.\nThese reviews have included consideration by VMware\u2019s senior management and the VMware board of directors of\npotential strategic alternatives, including acquisitions, business combinations and other strategic transactions.\nHowever, VMware\u2019s recent focus, both before and after the VMware spin-off on November 1, 2021, had been on\nexecuting its standalone plan.\nOn April 26, 2022, the assistant to Hock E. Tan, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Broadcom, contacted the\nassistant to Michael S. Dell, the Chairman of the VMware board of directors and a large VMware stockholder, to\nrequest a meeting between Mr. Tan and Mr. Dell. The topic of the meeting was not specified. Mr. Tan\u2019s and Mr. Dell\u2019s\nassistants scheduled the meeting for May 6, 2022. At the May 6 meeting, Mr. Tan told Mr. Dell that Broadcom would\nbe interested in a potential combination with VMware on a friendly basis. Mr. Tan and Mr. Dell discussed Broadcom\u2019s\nstrategic rationale with respect to such a transaction, but did not discuss the price or any other terms of a potential\ntransaction. Mr. Dell suggested that Mr. Tan also have a discussion with Egon Durban, a member of the VMware\nboard of directors and the Co-Chief Executive Officer of Silver Lake, another large stockholder of VMware, to discuss\na potential transaction. Silver Lake was formerly an investor in Broadcom until 2019. Following the meeting, Mr. Dell\ncontacted Paul Sagan, the lead independent director of the VMware board of directors, as well as Mr. Durban, and\ninformed them each of the discussion with Mr. Tan. Additionally, on May 6, 2022, following the meeting with Mr. Dell,\nMr. Tan placed a telephone call to Mr. Durban to arrange a subsequent conversation regarding a potential\ntransaction. On May 7, 2022, Mr. Tan and Mr. Durban discussed a potential transaction by telephone and, on May 12,\n2022, Mr. Tan met with Mr. Durban, along with executives of Silver Lake and Broadcom, to discuss a potential\ntransaction.\nOn May 13, 2022, Broadcom delivered an unsolicited confidential proposal letter (referred to as the May 13 Letter) to\nMessrs. Dell, Durban and Sagan, proposing the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom in a cash and stock transaction.\nThe May 13 Letter was addressed to the VMware board of directors, and was promptly made available to the entire\nVMware board of directors. The May 13 Letter noted that Broadcom was prepared to offer VMware stockholders\n$142.50 per share of VMware common stock, in the form of either $142.50 in cash or 0.2422 shares of Broadcom\ncommon stock, at the election of each VMware stockholder and subject to proration so that the total transaction\nconsideration would be 50% cash and 50% stock. The May 13 Letter also noted that the proposed transaction would\nnot be subject to Broadcom stockholder approval nor a financing condition and would be funded through a\ncombination of cash on hand and committed debt financing. The May 13 Letter also\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nincluded letters from each of Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley providing that the foregoing banks\nwere highly confident that they would be able to arrange the necessary debt financing. Broadcom also indicated in\nthe May 13 Letter its desire to move quickly toward a definitive agreement with VMware, with announcement of a\ntransaction to coincide with VMware\u2019s scheduled earnings announcement on May 26, 2022, and stated that\nBroadcom was prepared to provide for a go-shop period immediately following execution of the definitive agreement,\non customary terms. Broadcom also requested that VMware provide Dell with the requisite tax opinion required by\nthe tax matters agreement between VMware and Dell in order for VMware to engage in a proposed transaction with\nBroadcom, in form and substance satisfactory to Dell, VMware and Broadcom, prior to the signing of a definitive\nagreement with VMware. Broadcom also expressed its expectation that Mr. Dell and Silver Lake would enter into\nvoting agreements to support the transaction and indicated that Broadcom would offer a member of the VMware\nboard of directors, with such member to be mutually agreed by Broadcom and VMware, a seat on the Broadcom\nboard of directors, effective upon the closing of the proposed transaction. Together with the May 13 Letter,\nBroadcom delivered a mutual non-disclosure agreement and a high-priority diligence request list.\nOn May 15, 2022, the VMware board of directors met with representatives of VMware management, as well as\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Gibson Dunn. During the meeting, the VMware board of directors\nreviewed the terms of the May 13 Letter with VMware management and its advisors. The VMware board of directors\ndiscussed its fiduciary duties in connection with the review of an unsolicited proposal and the fiduciary duties that\nmay apply to the transaction proposed in the May 13 Letter. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs also\nmade a presentation regarding the proposal in the May 13 Letter from a financial perspective based upon publicly\navailable market information. After discussion, the VMware board of directors determined to continue discussions\nwith Broadcom. In addition, the VMware board of directors established a committee comprised of Mr. Dell, Mr.\nDurban, Karen E. Dykstra, a member of the VMware board of directors, and Mr. Sagan (referred to as the VMware\ntransaction committee) for administrative efficiency purposes, with authority to, among other things, review, evaluate,\nconsider, investigate, discuss, negotiate and determine the advisability of any potential strategic alternatives\navailable to VMware, including a potential business combination with Broadcom. The VMware transaction committee\nwas also authorized to recommend to the full VMware board of directors what action or actions should be taken with\nrespect to a potential transaction, which could include a recommendation that the full VMware board of directors\nreject the proposal from Broadcom. It was noted that the full VMware board of directors retained authority with\nrespect to approval of any proposed transaction. It was also understood that the VMware board of directors would\ncontinue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic transactions and that each director would be invited\nto all meetings of the VMware transaction committee.

The VMware board of directors noted the customary relationship disclosures previously provided\nby Goldman Sachs regarding Goldman Sachs\u2019 relationships with VMware, Broadcom and MSD Capital L.P. and Silver\nLake and their respective affiliates and the customary relationship disclosures previously provided by J.P. Morgan\nregarding their relationships with VMware, Broadcom and Silver Lake and the VMware board of directors did not\nidentify any concerns with these disclosures. The representatives of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan each discussed\nthe procedures and process in connection with delivery of their respective opinions, assuming successful completion\nof the negotiations and finalization of the terms of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.\nRepresentatives of Gibson Dunn also reviewed the key terms of the merger agreement and the voting agreements to\nbe entered into by each of the MSD stockholders and the SL stockholders.\nEarly in the morning on May 26, 2022, the VMware board of directors met with representatives of VMware\nmanagement, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Gibson Dunn, Silver Lake and Axinn. Representatives of Gibson Dunn\nreviewed with the VMware board of directors their fiduciary duties in the context of considering the proposed\ntransaction. Representatives of Gibson Dunn also provided an update on the negotiation of the merger agreement\nand related transaction documents, including updates to the final terms of the merger agreement since the earlier\nmeeting of the VMware board of directors on May 25. The representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan\nagain reviewed with the VMware board of directors Goldman Sachs\u2019 and J.P. Morgan\u2019s respective financial analyses\nof the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of VMware common stock (other than\nBroadcom and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement. The representatives of Goldman Sachs then rendered\nthe oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated May 26, 2022, to\nthe VMware board of directors that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the various\nlimitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to the\nholders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock pursuant to the merger\nagreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The representatives of J.P. Morgan then also\nrendered the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion dated May 26,\n2022 to the VMware board of directors that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the various\nlimitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid to holders of\nVMware common stock in the transactions was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following\ndiscussion, and taking into consideration various factors, including those described in the section titled \u201c-VMware\u2019s\nReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the VMware Board of Directors,\u201d the VMware board of directors\nunanimously (i) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions are fair to, and in the best\ninterests of, VMware and the VMware stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of VMware and the\nVMware stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement, (iii) approved the execution and\ndelivery by VMware of the merger agreement, the performance by VMware of its covenants and agreements\ncontained therein and the consummation of the transactions substantially upon the terms and conditions set forth in\nthe merger agreement and (iv) resolved to recommend that the VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger\nagreement.\nBefore the opening of New York Stock Exchange normal trading hours on May 26, 2022, the applicable parties\nexecuted the merger agreement and the voting agreements, Broadcom delivered to VMware fully executed versions of\nthe debt commitment letter and Gibson Dunn delivered the legal opinion required by the tax matters agreement\nbetween VMware and Dell for VMware to engage in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nPromptly following execution of the merger agreement, VMware and Broadcom publicly announced the merger\nagreement.\nLater on May 26, 2022, in accordance with the go-shop provisions in the merger agreement, at the direction of the\nVMware board of directors, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs began contacting parties about their\ninterest in participating in the go-shop process. During the go-shop period, representatives of\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nJ.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs contacted 10 potential strategic acquirors (including Party A and Party B). Of such\ncontacted parties, two potential strategic acquirors executed acceptable confidentiality agreements. During the go-\nshop period, VMware provided confidential information in response to due diligence inquiries made by these two\npotential strategic acquirors. At 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on July 5, 2022, the go-shop period expired without any party\nsubmitting a proposal to acquire VMware.\nVMware\u2019s Reasons for the Transactions\u037e Recommendation of the VMware Board of Directors\nAt its May 26, 2022 meeting held to evaluate the transactions, the VMware board of directors unanimously (i)\ndetermined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions are fair to, and in the best interests, of\nVMware and the VMware stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of VMware and the VMware\nstockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement, (iii) approved the execution and delivery\nby VMware of the merger agreement, the performance by VMware of its covenants and agreements contained therein\nand the consummation of the transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger\nagreement and (iv) resolved to recommend that the VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.\nAdditionally, the VMware board of directors has approved, adopted, authorized and declared advisable the charter\namendment. The VMware board of directors recommends that VMware stockholders vote:\n1.\n\u201cFOR\u201d the merger agreement proposal\u037e\n2.\n\u201cFOR\u201d the merger-related compensation proposal\u037e\n3.\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal\u037e and\n4.\n\u201cFOR\u201d the charter amendment proposal.\nIn evaluating the transactions and the merger agreement and arriving at its determination, the VMware board of\ndirectors consulted with VMware\u2019s senior management, representatives of VMware\u2019s financial advisors, Goldman\nSachs and J.P. Morgan and VMware\u2019s outside legal counsel, Gibson Dunn, and considered a number of substantive\nfactors, both positive and negative, and potential benefits and detriments of the transactions to VMware and its\nstockholders. The VMware board of directors believed that, taken as a whole, the following factors supported its\ndecision to approve the transactions:\n\u2022\nMerger Consideration. The value of the merger consideration to be received by VMware stockholders in\nrelation to the market prices of VMware common stock prior to the VMware board of directors\u2019 approval of\nthe merger agreement.\n\u2022\nPremium to Trading Price of VMware Common Stock. The fact that the implied value per share of VMware\ncommon stock of $142.50 assuming a cash election and no proration, the implied value per share of VMware\ncommon stock of $136.88 assuming a stock election and no proration and a blended value per share of\nVMware common stock of $139.69 (assuming proration of 50% cash and 50% equity based on the treatment\nof VMware common stock, stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units pursuant to\nthe merger agreement), each calculated as of May 20, 2022 (the last trading day prior to market speculation\nregarding the transactions), represented a premium of 49%, 43% and 46%, respectively, over the closing\nprice per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 on May 20, 2022. The VMware board of directors also\nconsidered the fact that the implied value per share of VMware common stock of $142.50 assuming a cash\nelection and no proration, the implied value per share of VMware common stock of $132.10 assuming a\nstock election and no proration and a blended value per share of VMware common stock of $137.30\n(assuming proration of 50% cash and 50% equity based on the treatment of VMware common stock, stock\noptions, restricted stock units and performance stock units pursuant to the merger agreement), each\ncalculated as of May 24, 2022, represented a premium of 49%, 38% and 43%, respectively, over the closing\nprice per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 on May 20, 2022.\n\u2022\nUncertainty of Future Common Stock Market Price. The uncertainty of VMware\u2019s future stock market price\nif VMware remained independent. The VMware board of directors considered VMware\u2019s business, assets,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, management, competitive position and prospects, as well as\ncurrent industry, economic and stock and credit market conditions. The VMware board of directors also\nconsidered VMware\u2019s long range plan and the initiatives and the potential\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexecution risks associated with such plan. In connection with these considerations, the VMware board of\ndirectors considered the attendant risk that if VMware remained independent, VMware common stock\nmight not trade at levels equal to or greater than the value of the merger consideration in the near term,\nover an extended period of time or at all.\n\u2022\nNegotiations with Broadcom. The benefits that VMware and its advisors were able to obtain during its\nnegotiations with Broadcom. The VMware board of directors believed that the consideration reflected in\nthe merger agreement was the best transaction that could be obtained by VMware stockholders at the time,\nand that there was no assurance that a more favorable opportunity to sell VMware would arise later or\nthrough any alternative transaction.\n\u2022\nStockholder Election Opportunity. The fact that VMware stockholders would have the right to elect to\nreceive the merger consideration either in cash or shares of Broadcom common stock, subject to proration.\n\u2022\nSignificant Portion of Merger Consideration in Cash. The fact that 50% of the merger consideration will be\npaid in cash, giving VMware stockholders the opportunity to immediately realize value for a significant\nportion of their investment and providing certainty of value. The VMware board of directors also\nconsidered the fact that VMware stockholders would be able to reinvest the cash consideration received in\nthe transactions in shares of Broadcom common stock if they desired to do so.\n\u2022\nParticipation in Potential Upside. The benefits of Broadcom that could result from the transactions,\nincluding the potential to realize synergies. The VMware board of directors also considered the fact that,\nsince a portion of the merger consideration will be paid in shares of Broadcom common stock, VMware\nstockholders will benefit from an approximately 12% pro forma continuing equity ownership in Broadcom\n(based on share data of VMware and Broadcom on May 24, 2022) and have the opportunity to participate\nin any future earnings or growth of Broadcom and future appreciation in the value of Broadcom common\nstock following the transactions should they determine to retain the shares of Broadcom common stock\npayable in the transactions.\n\u2022\nFixed Exchange Ratio for Stock Portion of Merger Consideration. The fact that because the stock\nconsideration is based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.25200 of a share of Broadcom common stock, VMware\nstockholders receiving a portion of the merger consideration in shares of Broadcom common stock will\nhave the opportunity to benefit from any increase in the trading price of shares of Broadcom common stock\nbetween the announcement of the merger agreement and the completion of the transactions and that the\ncash portion of the merger consideration will limit the impact of a decline in the trading price of Broadcom\ncommon stock on the aggregate value of the merger consideration.\n\u2022\nTax Treatment. The fact that the transactions are intended to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, as\ndescribed in greater detail under \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.\u201d\n\u2022\nExpected Cost Synergies. The expectation that Broadcom will recognize anticipated cost synergies\nfollowing consummation of the transactions, which VMware stockholders will benefit from as continuing\nstockholders of Broadcom. The VMware board of directors also considered that there could be no\nassurance that any particular amount of such synergies would be achieved following completion of the\ntransactions or the timeframe in which they would be achieved.\n\u2022\nFinancial Analyses and Opinion of Goldman Sachs. The oral opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the\nVMware board of directors, subsequently confirmed by delivery of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs,\ndated May 26, 2022, that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the various\nlimitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the aggregate merger consideration to be paid\nto the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock pursuant to the\nmerger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The opinion is more fully\ndescribed in the section titled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs\u201d and the full text of the opinion is attached as\nAnnex D to this proxy statement/prospectus. The VMware board of directors considered that Goldman\nSachs, in connection with delivering its opinion, performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses\ndescribed in the section titled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs.\u201d\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nFinancial Analyses and Opinion of J.P. Morgan. The oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the VMware\nboard of directors on May 26, 2022, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion,\ndated May 26, 2022, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various limitations,\nqualifications and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to holders of\nVMware common stock in the transactions was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The\nopinion is more fully described in the section titled \u201c-Opinion of J.P. Morgan\u201d and the full text of the\nopinion is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus. The VMware board of directors\nconsidered that J.P. Morgan, in connection with delivering its opinion, performed a variety of financial and\ncomparative analyses described in the section titled \u201c-Opinion of J.P. Morgan.\u201d\n\u2022\nLikelihood of Consummation. The likelihood that the transactions would be completed, in light of, among\nother things, the conditions to the transactions, the absence of a financing condition, and the efforts\nrequired to obtain regulatory approvals.\n\u2022\nBoard Representation. The fact that one member of the VMware board of directors, to be mutually agreed\nby VMware and Broadcom, will join the Broadcom board of directors.\n\u2022\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, the conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations\nto complete the transactions and their ability to terminate the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provisions of the merger agreement that permit VMware, during a 40-day go-shop period, to solicit\nalternative proposals from third parties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provisions of the merger agreement that allow VMware to engage in negotiations with, and\nprovide information to, a third party that makes a written bona fide acquisition proposal following the\ngo-shop period that did not result from a breach of VMware\u2019s non-solicitation obligations, if the\nVMware board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal\ncounsel and financial advisors, that such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to\nlead to a transaction that is superior to the transactions and VMware complies with certain procedural\nrequirements\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provisions of the merger agreement that allow the VMware board of directors to change its\nrecommendation in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal\nand terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal if the VMware board of\ndirectors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial\nadvisors, that an acquisition proposal is a superior proposal and, after consultation with its outside\nlegal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with\nthe VMware board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties (including taking into account any modifications to\nthe terms of the merger agreement that are proposed by Broadcom and, in connection with the\ntermination of the merger agreement, payment to Broadcom of a $750 million termination fee for\ntermination during the go-shop period or a $1.5 billion termination fee for termination following the go-\nshop period), subject to VMware\u2019s compliance with certain procedural requirements\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provisions of the merger agreement that allow the VMware board of directors to change its\nrecommendation in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement (other than in response to the\nreceipt of a written bona fide acquisition proposal, which is subject to the preceding sub-bullet above)\nif the VMware board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal\ncounsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its\ndirectors\u2019 fiduciary duties (including taking into account any modifications to the terms of the merger\nagreement that are proposed by Broadcom), subject to VMware\u2019s compliance with certain procedural\nrequirements\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief of the VMware board of directors that the payment of either the $1.5 billion termination fee\nor the $750 million termination fee, as applicable, were not likely to unduly discourage competing third-\nparty proposals or reduce the price of such proposals and that the lower\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n$750 million termination fee would make it more likely for potential acquirors to consider making a\nsuperior proposal, that such termination fees and provisions are customary for transactions of this\nsize and type, and that the sizes of the respective termination fees were reasonable in the context of\ncomparable transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that upon termination of the merger agreement in certain circumstances, Broadcom would be\nrequired to pay to VMware a $1.5 billion termination fee that would help offset some of the costs of\nthe transaction\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe ability of VMware to specifically enforce the terms of the merger agreement.\n\u2022\nTiming Considerations. The belief of the VMware board of directors that the benefits of soliciting interest\nfrom other potential parties were outweighed by a number of risks, including that such solicitation would\nfurther increase market speculation and jeopardize or, at a minimum, delay the transactions. The VMware\nboard of directors also observed that VMware had the right to solicit alternative proposals during the go-\nshop period and that VMware retained the ability to consider unsolicited proposals after the go-shop\nperiod until the meeting of the VMware stockholders to vote on the merger agreement proposal and to\nenter into an agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal under certain circumstances (concurrently\nwith terminating the merger agreement and paying the $1.5 billion termination fee or the $750 million\ntermination fee, as applicable).\n\u2022\nStrategic Benefits. The VMware board of directors considered that the transactions are expected to provide\na number of significant strategic opportunities, including the following (not necessarily listed in order of\nrelative importance):\n\u2022\nthe transaction would synergistically combine VMware\u2019s proven technology offerings with\nBroadcom\u2019s broader capabilities. Broadcom would facilitate a diversity of service offerings, client\nrelationships, geographies and end markets and offer enterprise customers greater choice, value and\nflexibility to address complex IT infrastructure challenges\u037e\n\u2022\nthe complementary nature of each company\u2019s solutions and platforms\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe expectation that the transactions would result in a company with increased capabilities and world-\nclass products in core market segments that will be uniquely positioned to serve, facilitate and power\nthe markets of the future.\n\u2022\nBroadcom\u2019s Business and Reputation. The results of the due diligence investigation that VMware\u2019s senior\nmanagement conducted with the assistance of its advisors on Broadcom with respect to certain matters and\nBroadcom\u2019s business reputation and capabilities of Broadcom and its management. The VMware board of\ndirectors also considered Broadcom\u2019s strong track record as an experienced acquirer, which is likely to\nfacilitate an effective and timely integration of VMware\u2019s business and operations.\n\u2022\nFinancing Strength of Broadcom. The fact that Broadcom has obtained committed debt financing for the\ntransactions from reputable financial institutions and likelihood that Broadcom would be able to finance the\ntransactions given Broadcom\u2019s financial resources and financial profile.\n\u2022\nAvailability of Appraisal Rights. The fact that appraisal rights would be available to holders of VMware\ncommon stock under Delaware law and that there was no condition in the merger agreement relating to the\nmaximum number of shares of VMware common stock that could exercise appraisal rights.\n\u2022\nMSD Stockholders and SL Stockholders Voting Agreements. The support of the transactions by the MSD\nstockholders and the SL stockholders, as evidenced by the execution of the voting agreements.\nThe VMware board of directors also considered certain potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning\nthe transactions, including the following:\n\u2022\nFixed Stock Ratio of Merger Consideration. The fact that because the stock portion of the merger\nconsideration is a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Broadcom common stock to VMware common stock,\nVMware stockholders could be adversely affected by a decrease in the trading price of Broadcom common\nstock during the pendency of the transactions and the fact that the merger\n60\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nagreement does not provide VMware with a termination right or other similar protection relating to the\ntrading price of Broadcom common stock. The VMware board of directors determined that this structure\nwas appropriate and the risk acceptable in view of factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe VMware board of directors\u2019 review of the relative intrinsic values and financial performance of\nBroadcom and VMware\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that VMware stockholders may elect cash consideration, subject to proration, which limits the\nimpact of a decline in the trading price of Broadcom common stock on the value of the merger\nconsideration.\n\u2022\nPossible Failure to Achieve Synergies. The risk that the potential benefits and synergies sought in the\ntransactions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period, and the risk\nassociated with the integration by Broadcom of VMware.\n\u2022\nSmaller Ongoing Equity Participation in Broadcom by VMware Stockholders. The fact that because only\n50% of the merger consideration will be in the form of Broadcom common stock, VMware stockholders will\nhave a smaller ongoing equity participation in Broadcom (and, as a result, a smaller opportunity to\nparticipate in any future earnings or growth of Broadcom and future appreciation in the value of Broadcom\ncommon stock following the completion of the transactions) than they have in VMware.\n\u2022\nRisk of Non-Completion. The possibility that the transactions might not be completed, including as a result\nof the failure to obtain regulatory approvals or the failure of VMware stockholders to approve the merger\nagreement proposal, and the effect the resulting public announcement of the termination of the merger\nagreement may have on:\n\u2022\nthe trading price of VMware common stock\u037e and\n\u2022\nVMware\u2019s business and operating results, particularly in light of the costs incurred in connection with\nthe transactions.\n\u2022\nPossible Deterrence of Competing Offers. The risk that various provisions of the merger agreement,\nincluding the requirement that VMware must pay to Broadcom a termination fee of either $750 million if the\nmerger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances during the go-shop period or $1.5 billion if the\nmerger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances following the expiration of the go-shop period,\nmay discourage other parties potentially interested in an acquisition of, or combination with, VMware from\npursuing that opportunity.\n\u2022\nPossible Disruption of the Business and Costs and Expenses. The possible disruption to VMware\u2019s\nbusiness that may result from the transactions, the resulting distraction of VMware\u2019s management and\npotential attrition of VMware\u2019s employees, as well as the costs and expenses associated with completing\nthe transactions.\n\u2022\nRestrictions on Operation of VMware\u2019s Business. The requirement that VMware conduct its business in a\ncommercially reasonable manner and in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent\nwith past practice prior to completion of the transactions.\n\u2022\nImpact of Announcement. The uncertainty about the effect of the transactions, regardless of whether the\ntransactions are completed, on VMware\u2019s employees, customers and other parties, may impair VMware\u2019s\nability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers and others to\nseek to change existing business relationships with VMware, and the potential for litigation arising in\nconnection with the transactions.\n\u2022\nNeed to Obtain Required Regulatory Clearances. The fact that completion of the transactions would require\napproval, or expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, under the HSR Act and other\napplicable non-U.S. antitrust laws.\n\u2022\nOther Risks. The risks described under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page 27.\nThe VMware board of directors concluded that the potentially negative factors associated with the transactions were\nsignificantly outweighed by the potential benefits that it expected the VMware stockholders\n61\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwould achieve as a result of the transactions, including the belief of the VMware board of directors that the\ntransactions would maximize the immediate value of VMware stockholders\u2019 shares and minimize the risks and\nuncertainty affecting the future prospects of VMware, including the potential execution risks associated with its\nstand-alone financial plan. Accordingly, the VMware board of directors unanimously (i) determined that the terms of\nthe merger agreement and the transactions are fair to, and in the best interests, of VMware and the VMware\nstockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of VMware and the VMware stockholders, and declared it\nadvisable, to enter into the merger agreement, (iii) approved the execution and delivery by VMware of the merger\nagreement, the performance by VMware of its covenants and agreements contained therein and the consummation of\nthe transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and (iv) resolved to\nrecommend that the VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.\nIn addition, the VMware board of directors was aware of and considered the interests that VMware\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers may have with respect to the transactions that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of\nstockholders of VMware generally, as described under \u201c-Interests of VMware\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Transactions.\u201d\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the VMware board of directors is not\nexhaustive, but VMware believes it includes all the material factors considered by the VMware board of directors. In\nview of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the transactions and the\ncomplexity of these matters, the VMware board of directors did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to,\nquantify or otherwise assign relative or specific weight or values to any of these factors. Rather, the VMware board\nof directors viewed its position and recommendation as being based on an overall analysis and on the totality of the\ninformation presented to and factors considered by it. In addition, in considering the factors described above,\nindividual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The VMware board of directors based its\nunanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented.\nThis explanation of VMware\u2019s reasons for the transactions and other information presented in this section is forward-\nlooking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors described under \u201cCautionary Statement\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nCertain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware\u2019s Financial Advisors\nWhile VMware has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, VMware\u2019s management does\nnot, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to future performance due\nto, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and the likelihood\nthat the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized. In connection with the transactions, VMware\nprovided certain unaudited non-public financial projections regarding VMware to the VMware board of directors,\nwhich are referred to as the \u201cVMware management financial projections.\u201d At the direction of the VMware board of\ndirectors, the VMware management financial projections were also provided to, and approved for use by, Goldman\nSachs and J.P. Morgan for purposes of performing their respective financial analyses in connection with rendering\ntheir respective opinions to the VMware board of directors (as more fully described in the sections titled \u201c-Opinion of\nGoldman Sachs\u201d and \u201c-Opinion of J.P. Morgan\u201d). In addition, VMware management provided to the VMware board of\ndirectors, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan certain unaudited non-public financial projections for Broadcom, which\nwere informed by Wall Street consensus estimates for Broadcom and due diligence discussions between VMware\u2019s\nmanagement and Broadcom during VMware\u2019s reverse due diligence process and are referred to as the \u201cVMware-\napproved Broadcom financial projections\u201d and, together with the VMware management financial projections, the\n\u201cfinancial projections.\u201d The financial metrics set forth in the section titled \u201c-VMware-Approved Broadcom Financial\nProjections\u201d were arithmetically calculated by J.P. Morgan solely using information provided in the VMware-\napproved Broadcom financial projections and were approved by VMware for use by J.P. Morgan for purposes of\nperforming its financial analyses in connection with rendering its opinion to the VMware board of directors (as more\nfully described in the section titled \u201c-Opinion of J.P. Morgan\u201d). However, the VMware-approved Broadcom financial\nprojections were not utilized by Goldman Sachs for purposes of performing its financial analyses in connection with\nrendering its opinion to the VMware board of directors\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(as more fully described in the section titled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs\u201d). A summary of these financial projections\nis included below to give VMware stockholders access to certain information that was considered by the VMware\nboard of directors for purposes of evaluating the transactions. These projections are not, and should not be viewed\nas, public guidance or even targets.\nThe financial projections, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables and\nassumptions, including about future performance, that are inherently uncertain and many of which are beyond\nVMware\u2019s and Broadcom\u2019s control. The financial projections reflect numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments\nmade by VMware management, based on information available at the time the financial projections were developed,\nwith respect to industry performance and competition, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial\nconditions, other future events and matters specific to VMware\u2019s and Broadcom\u2019s business, all of which are difficult\nto predict and many of which are beyond VMware\u2019s and Broadcom\u2019s control. There can be no assurances that the\nfinancial projections accurately reflect future trends or accurately estimate VMware\u2019s or Broadcom\u2019s future financial\nand operating performance. The financial projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that\nare subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the financial projections not to be\nachieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to VMware\u2019s and Broadcom\u2019s business\n(including the ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods), industry\nperformance, general business and economic conditions and other factors described in or referenced under\n\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and those risks and uncertainties detailed in\nVMware\u2019s and Broadcom\u2019s public filings with the SEC. Further, the financial projections cover multiple years and by\ntheir nature become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. Accordingly, there can be no assurance\nthat the financial projections will be realized, and actual results may vary materially from those shown. Modeling and\nforecasting the future performance of a software company is a highly speculative endeavor. Since the financial\nprojections cover a long period of time, the financial projections by their nature are unlikely to anticipate each\ncircumstance that will have an effect on the commercial value of VMware\u2019s and Broadcom\u2019s products and services.\nThe principal assumptions reflected in the VMware management financial projections include (i) VMware continuing\nto drive a progressive business model transition from a majority of software sales being comprised of perpetual\nlicense software to a majority of software sales being comprised of software-as-a-service (referred to as SaaS) or\nsubscription offerings\u037e (ii) bookings growth rates remaining at or ahead of projected market compound annual growth\nrates (based on projections from April 2022) for a majority of product offerings, leading to (A) year-over-year growth\nof subscription and SaaS revenue ranging from 26% to 37% in fiscal years 2023 through 2025 and (B) revenue growth\nof 9% and 11% in fiscal years 2024 and 2025, respectively, fueled by subscription and SaaS revenue, which is\nprojected to account for 46% of the overall revenue mix in fiscal year 2025\u037e (iii) expansion of operating margin to\n30.0% in fiscal year 2025, representing a return to pre-SaaS transition operating margins as VMware\u2019s subscription\nand SaaS business model scales and operational investments driving transition or dual operating model (on-premises\nsoftware or SaaS) are reduced and a majority of offerings are subscription and SaaS\u037e (iv) returning to double digit\noperating cash flow growth starting fiscal year 2025 as collections related to SaaS transition normalize and operating\nmargin improves\u037e and (v) expiration of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amendments to Code Section 174, which would\nno longer permit an immediate deduction for research and development expenditures in the tax year in which such\ncosts are incurred, impacting both (A) the annual tax rate applicable to VMware, forecasted at 16% in fiscal year 2023\nand increasing to 23% in fiscal years 2024-2027 and (B) cash tax payments commensurate with an expected increase in\ntax rate which would impact operating cash flow starting in fiscal year 2023.\nThe principal assumptions reflected in the VMware-approved Broadcom financial projections include (i) use of\nanalyst consensus estimates and growth rates as of May 20, 2022 for fiscal years 2022, 2023 and 2024 to inform all\nfinancial and cash flow metrics\u037e (ii) revenue growth estimates for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 estimated to be similar to\nthe consensus revenue growth rates for fiscal years 2023 and 2024\u037e (iii) gross margins and operating margins in fiscal\nyears 2025 and 2026 remaining consistent with consensus projections for fiscal years 2022 through 2024\u037e and (iv)\ncash flow metrics, such as capital expenditures, cash tax rate, depreciation and amortization and stock-based\ncompensation, remaining consistent as a percentage of revenue over the forecast period.\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily\ncomply with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information or generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (referred to as GAAP).\nThe financial projections included in this document, including the financial projections set forth below in the sections\ntitled \u201c-VMware Management Financial Projections\u201d and \u201c-VMware-Approved Broadcom Financial Projections,\u201d are\nthe responsibility of VMware\u2019s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, VMware\u2019s independent registered public\naccounting firm, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to\nthe financial projections and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other\nform of assurance with respect thereto.

It does not extend to the financial projections\nand should not be read to do so.\nThe financial projections are not being included in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to influence any VMware\nstockholder\u2019s decision as to whether or not to approve the transactions or whether or not to seek appraisal rights\nwith respect to shares of VMware common stock held by such stockholder. The summary of the financial projections\nis being included in this proxy statement/prospectus solely because these financial projections were made available\nto the VMware board of directors, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.\nThe financial projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were\nprepared, including the announcement of the transactions and transaction-related expenses. The financial projections\nalso do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions to close and should not be viewed as\naccurate or continuing in that context.\nThe inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication\nthat VMware, Broadcom, Goldman Sachs or J.P. Morgan or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or\nrepresentatives considered or consider the financial projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the\nfinancial projections should not be relied on as such. None of VMware, Broadcom, Goldman Sachs or J.P.

Such financial\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in\naccordance with GAAP. VMware\u2019s calculations of these financial measures may differ from others in its industry and\nare not necessarily comparable with information presented under similar captions used by other companies. Financial\nmeasures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the SEC\u2019s definition of non-GAAP financial measures and\ntherefore are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which may otherwise\nrequire a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure to be presented.\nReconciliations of these financial measures were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs or J.P. Morgan for purposes of\nperforming their respective financial analyses in connection with rendering their respective opinions to the VMware\nboard of directors (as described in the sections titled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs\u201d and \u201c-Opinion of J.P.

Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion\nfor the information and assistance of the VMware board of directors in connection with its consideration of the\ntransactions. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of VMware common stock\nshould vote with respect to the transactions or any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman\nSachs reviewed, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of VMware for the five fiscal years ended\nJanuary 28, 2022, for Broadcom for the four fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and for Broadcom Limited,\nBroadcom\u2019s predecessor, for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2017\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of VMware and Broadcom\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain other communications from VMware and Broadcom to their respective stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for VMware and Broadcom\u037e and\n\u2022\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for VMware prepared by its management, as approved for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 use by VMware (referred to in this section titled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs\u201d as VMware\nmanagement financial projections and summarized in the section titled \u201c-Certain Financial Projections\nUtilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware\u2019s Financial Advisors-VMware Management\nFinancial Projections\u201d), certain financial analyses and forecasts for Broadcom stand-alone prepared by the\nmanagement of VMware, as approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by VMware, and certain operating synergies\nprojected by the management of VMware to result from the transactions.\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of VMware and Broadcom regarding\ntheir assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the transactions and the past and current\nbusiness operations, financial condition and future prospects of Broadcom and with members of the senior\nmanagement of VMware regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition\nand future prospects of VMware\u037e reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of VMware common\nstock and Broadcom common stock\u037e compared certain financial and stock market information for VMware and\nBroadcom with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded\u037e reviewed\nthe financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the technology, media and telecom industry\u037e and\nperformed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the VMware board of directors, relied\nupon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other\ninformation provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for independent\nverification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the VMware board of directors that\nthe VMware management financial projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently\navailable estimates and judgments of the management of VMware. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent\nevaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet\nassets and liabilities) of VMware or Broadcom or any of their respective subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not\nfurnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other\nconsents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the transactions would be obtained without any adverse\neffect on VMware or Broadcom or on the expected benefits of the\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntransactions in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the transactions would be\nconsummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or\ncondition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of VMware to engage in the transactions\nor the relative merits of the transactions as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to VMware\u037e\nnor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters or the fairness of the proration and other\nprocedures and limitations contained in the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did\nnot solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, VMware\nor any other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of\nview to the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock, as of the date of the\nwritten opinion, of the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger\nagreement or the transactions or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger\nagreement or entered into or amended in connection with the transactions, including the fairness of the transactions\nto, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or\nother constituencies of VMware\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or\npayable to any of the officers, directors or employees of VMware, or class of such persons, in connection with the\ntransactions, whether relative to the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of VMware\ncommon stock (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion does not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Broadcom common stock or VMware\ncommon stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets\non VMware or Broadcom or the transactions, or as to the impact of the transactions on the solvency or viability of\nVMware or Broadcom or the ability of VMware or Broadcom to pay their respective obligations when they come due.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions, as in effect on,\nand the information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility\nfor updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the\ndate of its opinion. Goldman Sachs\u2019 advisory services and its opinion expressed were provided for the information\nand assistance of the VMware board in connection with its consideration of the transactions and such opinion does\nnot constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of VMware common stock should vote or make any\nelection with respect to the transactions or any other matter. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness\ncommittee of Goldman Sachs.\nSummary of Material Financial Analysis\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to the VMware board of\ndirectors in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not\npurport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of\nanalyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the\nsummaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together\nwith the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is\nbased on market data as it existed on or before May 25, 2022, the last trading day before the public announcement of\nthe transactions and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nImplied Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia described below using\nimplied values of the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares\nof VMware common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. For purposes of this analysis, Goldman Sachs\ncalculated implied values for the merger consideration, reflecting an implied value per share of VMware common\nstock assuming a cash election and no proration, an implied value per share of VMware common stock assuming a\nstock election and no proration and a blended value per share of VMware common stock (assuming proration of 50%\ncash and 50% equity based on the treatment of VMware common stock, stock options, restricted stock units and\nperformance stock units pursuant to the merger agreement), each calculated as of May 20, 2022 (the last trading day\nprior to market speculation regarding the transactions) (referred to in this section titled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs\u201d\nas the Undisturbed Date), and as of May 24, 2022, the last trading\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nday prior to the May 25th meeting of the VMware board of directors at which Goldman Sachs reviewed with the\nVMware board of directors its financial analyses of the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to the holders of\nshares of VMware common stock (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement.\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the implied values of the merger consideration per share\nof VMware common stock relative to:\n\u2022\n$95.71, the closing price for VMware common stock on the Undisturbed Date\u037e and\n\u2022\n$115.94, the closing price for VMware common stock on May 24, 2022.\nThe results of these calculations are as follows:\nAs of May 20, 2022\nAs of May 24, 2022\nCash \nElection\nStock \nElection\nBlended\nValue\nCash \nElection\nStock \nElection\nBlended\nValue\nImplied Value per Share of VMware Common\nStock\n$142.50\n$136.88\n$139.69\n$142.50\n$132.10\n$137.30\nImplied Premium to:\nShare Price as of May 20, 2022 of $95.71\n49%\n43%\n46%\n49%\n38%\n43%\nShare Price as of May 24, 2022 of $115.94\n23%\n18%\n20%\n23%\n14%\n18%\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the VMware management financial projections, Goldman Sachs\nperformed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on VMware to derive a range of illustrative present values per\nshare of VMware common stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and discount rates\nranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting estimates of VMware\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs\ndiscounted to present value as of April 29, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for VMware, as\narithmetically calculated by Goldman Sachs solely using information provided in the VMware management financial\nprojections and approved by VMware\u2019s management for use by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its opinion and\nfinancial analyses and referred to as \u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow (Less Stock-Based Compensation Expenses)\u201d in the\nsection titled \u201cThe Merger-Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware\u2019s\nFinancial Advisors,\u201d for the nine months ended January 28, 2023 and fiscal years 2024 through 2027 and (ii) a range\nof illustrative terminal values for VMware, which were calculated by applying illustrative perpetuity growth rates\nranging from 2.0% to 3.0% to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by VMware, as\napproved by VMware management for use by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its opinion and financial analyses.\nBased on the foregoing, Goldman Sachs also calculated implied terminal value to next twelve months unlevered free\ncash flow multiples ranging from 10.9x to 15.8x. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the\nCapital Asset Pricing Model (referred to in this section titled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs\u201d as \u201cCAPM\u201d), which\nrequires certain company-specific inputs, including VMware\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-\nterm debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for\nVMware, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of illustrative\nperpetuity growth rates for VMware was estimated by Goldman Sachs using its professional judgment and\nexperience, taking into account, among other things, the VMware management financial projections and market\nexpectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for VMware by adding the ranges of present values it\nderived as described above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived\nfor VMware the amount of VMware\u2019s total debt and added the amount of VMware\u2019s cash and cash equivalents and\nstrategic investments as of April 29, 2022, as provided by VMware management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019\nuse by VMware management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for VMware. Goldman Sachs then divided\nthe range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of VMware as of\nthe Undisturbed Date, as provided by VMware management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by VMware\nmanagement, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the\nnearest $0.10, of $100.80 to $148.90.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the\nimplied present value of an illustrative future value per share of VMware common stock, which is designed to provide\nan indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of VMware\u2019s equity as a\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfunction of VMware\u2019s estimated future unlevered free cash flow and enterprise value to one-year forward unlevered\nfree cash flow (referred in this section titled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs\u201d as forward EV/UFCF) multiples. For this\nanalysis, Goldman Sachs used the VMware management financial projections for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2026.\nGoldman Sachs first calculated the implied future enterprise value of VMware as of January 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025,\nby applying a range of forward EV/UFCF multiples of 12.0x to 16.0x to the estimates of unlevered free cash flow for\nVMware, as reflected in the VMware management financial projections and referred to as Unlevered Free Cash Flow\nin the section titled \u201c-Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware\u2019s\nFinancial Advisors,\u201d for each of the fiscal years 2024, 2025 and 2026. These illustrative multiples were derived by\nGoldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account, among other things, current\nand historical average forward EV/UFCF multiples for VMware and certain selected diversified software companies\ndescribed in the section titled \u201c-Selected Public Company Comparables.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of VMware\u2019s total debt and added the amount of VMware\u2019s cash and\ncash equivalents and strategic investments as of January 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, each as provided by management\nof VMware and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by VMware management, to the range of implied enterprise values\nto derive a range of illustrative equity values as of January 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided\nthese implied equity values by the projected number of fully diluted outstanding shares of VMware, as provided by\nVMware management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by VMware management, as of January 31, 2023, 2024\nand 2025, to derive a range of implied future equity values per share of VMware common stock. Goldman Sachs then\ndiscounted these implied equity values per share to the Undisturbed Date, using an illustrative discount rate of 8.5%,\nreflecting an estimate of VMware\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the\nCAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for VMware, as well as certain financial\nmetrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values\nper share of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.10, of $92.30 to $139.90.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to\nthe following selected transactions in the technology, media and telecom industry. For each of the selected\ntransactions, where information was publicly available, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied\nenterprise value of the applicable target company based on the consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of\nthe target company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the next twelve month period\n(referred to in this section titled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs\u201d as EV/NTM EBITDA) at or prior to the announcement\nof the applicable transaction based on FactSet and Institutional Brokers\u2019 Estimate System estimates.\nThe following table identifies the transactions reviewed by Goldman Sachs as part of this analysis:\nAnnouncement Date\nAcquiror\nTarget\nEV/NTM \nEBITDA\nJanuary 2022\nElliott Investment Management L.P. and\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\nCitrix Systems, Inc.\n14.1x\nDecember 2021\nOracle Corporation\nCerner Corporation\n14.3x\nMarch 2021\nSymphony Technology Group, LLC\nMcAfee Corp.

Using this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a\nrange of illustrative EV/EBITDA multiples of 11.1x to 14.3x to an estimate of VMware\u2019s next twelve months\u2019 EBITDA,\nas reflected in the VMware management financial projections and referred to as \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d in the section\ntitled \u201c-Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware\u2019s Financial Advisors,\u201d\nto derive a range of implied enterprise values for VMware. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of implied\nenterprise values the amount of VMware\u2019s total debt and added the amount of VMware\u2019s cash and cash equivalents\nand strategic investments as of April 29, 2022, as provided by VMware management and approved for Goldman\nSachs\u2019 use by VMware management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for VMware. Goldman Sachs\ndivided the range of illustrative equity values by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of VMware as of the\nUndisturbed Date, as provided by management of VMware and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by management of\nVMware, to derive a range of implied values per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.10, of\n$99.10 to $132.90.\nPremia Paid Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition\npremia for 45 transactions announced from January 1, 2013 through the Undisturbed Date, involving a public\ntechnology, media, or telecommunication company based in the United States as the target where the disclosed\nenterprise value for the transaction was greater than $10 billion. For the entire period, Goldman Sachs calculated the\nmedian, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target\u2019s last\nundisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transactions. This analysis indicated a median premium\nof 30%, a 25th percentile premium of 22% and a 75th percentile premium of 45% across the period. Using this analysis\nand its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a range of illustrative premia of 22% to 45% to\nthe undisturbed closing price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 as of the Undisturbed Date and\ncalculated a range of implied values per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.10, of $116.80 to\n$138.80.\nSelected Public Company Comparables. Using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs reviewed and\ncompared forward EV/UFCF multiples for VMware and the following publicly traded companies in the diversified\nsoftware industry, which are collectively referred to as the \u201cselected companies\u201d:\n\u2022\nCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd.\n\u2022\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n\u2022\nF5, Inc.\n\u2022\nInternational Business Machines Corporation\n\u2022\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\u2022\nOracle Corporation\n\u2022\nSAP SE\nAlthough none of the selected companies is directly comparable to VMware, the companies included were chosen\nbecause they are publicly traded companies in the diversified software industry with certain operations that for\npurposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of VMware.\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared the average multiple of enterprise value to unlevered free cash flow over the\nnext twelve month period (referred to in this section titled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs\u201d as EV/NTM UFCF) for each\nof VMware and the selected companies over the (i) 5-year period prior to the Undisturbed Date and (ii) period from\nNovember 2, 2021 (the first trading day following the special cash dividend payment to VMware stockholders as part\nof the VMware spin-off) through the Undisturbed Date, in each case based on financial and trading data as of the\nUndisturbed Date obtained from public filings and FactSet.

Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the\nanalyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In\narriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to\nfairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.\nNo company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to VMware or\nBroadcom or the transactions.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the VMware board\nof directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of its opinion, of the aggregate merger\nconsideration to be paid to the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock\npursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the\nprices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are\nnot necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested\nby these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors\nor events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of VMware, Broadcom, Goldman Sachs\nor any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasts.\nThe aggregate merger consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between VMware and\nBroadcom and was approved by the VMware board of directors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to VMware during\nthese negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount or form of consideration to\nVMware or the VMware board of directors or that any specific amount or form of consideration constituted the only\nappropriate consideration for the transactions.\n71\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the VMware board of directors was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the VMware board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The\nforegoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in\nconnection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman\nSachs attached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and\ntrading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various\npersons and entities.

Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may\nhave co-invested with MSD Capital and Silver Lake and their respective affiliates from time to time and may have\ninvested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Silver Lake from time to time and may do so in the future.\nThe VMware board of directors selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally\nrecognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transactions.\nPursuant to a letter agreement dated May 25, 2022, VMware engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in\nconnection with the transactions. The engagement letter between VMware and Goldman Sachs provides for a\ntransaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately\n$45 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the transactions. In addition, VMware has agreed to\nreimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify\nGoldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities\nlaws.\nOpinion of J.P. Morgan\nPursuant to an engagement letter, VMware retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the\ntransactions.\nAt the meeting of the VMware board of directors on May 26, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the\nVMware board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various limitations, qualifications\nand assumptions set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of VMware common\nstock in the transactions was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan subsequently confirmed\nits oral opinion by delivering its written opinion, dated May 26, 2022, to the VMware board of directors, that, as of\nsuch date, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of VMware common stock in the transactions was fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated May 26, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex E to this proxy\nstatement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in\nthis proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. VMware\u2019s\nstockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the VMware\nboard of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the\ntransactions, was directed only to the merger consideration to be paid in the transactions and did not address any\nother aspect of the transactions. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to the\nholders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of VMware or as to the underlying decision\nby VMware to engage in the transactions. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was\n73\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\napproved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any\nstockholder of VMware as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the transactions or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft dated May 26, 2022 of the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning VMware and Broadcom\nand the industries in which they operate\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the transactions with the publicly available financial terms of\ncertain transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of VMware and Broadcom with publicly available\ninformation concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and\nhistorical market prices of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock and certain publicly traded\nsecurities of such other companies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of VMware relating\nto VMware and the business of Broadcom, as well as the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings\nand related expenses and synergies expected to result from the transactions (referred to in this section\ntitled \u201c- Opinion of J.P. Morgan\u201d as the synergies)\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of VMware and Broadcom with\nrespect to certain aspects of the transactions, and the past and current business operations of VMware and\nBroadcom, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of VMware and Broadcom, the effects of the\ntransactions on the financial condition and future prospects of VMware and Broadcom and certain other matters J.P.\nMorgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by VMware and Broadcom or otherwise\nreviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or\ncompleteness and, pursuant to J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement letter with VMware, J.P. Morgan did not assume any\nobligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with\nany valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of VMware or\nBroadcom under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial\nanalyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, including the synergies, J.P. Morgan assumed\nthat they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and\njudgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of VMware and\nBroadcom to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts\n(including the synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the\ntransactions will qualify as tax-free reorganizations for United States federal income tax purposes, and will be\nconsummated as described in the merger agreement (and that any implementation of the alternative transaction\nstructure contemplated by the merger agreement would not have any effect on J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis), and that the\ndefinitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan.\nJ.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by VMware, Broadcom, Holdco, Merger Sub\n1 and Broadcom Merger Subs in the merger agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in\nall respects material to its analysis. J.P Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments\nmade by advisors to VMware with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental,\nregulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the transactions would be obtained\nwithout any adverse effect on VMware or Broadcom or on the contemplated benefits of the transactions.\nThe VMware management financial projections and the VMware approved Broadcom financial projections furnished\nto J.P. Morgan were prepared by VMware\u2019s management. VMware does not publicly disclose internal\n74\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmanagement projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis of the\ntransactions, and such financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These financial\nprojections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the\ncontrol of VMware\u2019s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive\nconditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in\nsuch financial projections. For more information regarding the use of financial projections and other forward-looking\nstatements, please refer to the section titled \u201c-Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of\nDirectors and VMware\u2019s Financial Advisors.\u201d\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of VMware common stock in the transactions, and J.P. Morgan\nexpressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the transactions to the\nholders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of VMware or as to the underlying decision\nby VMware to engage in the transactions. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount\nor nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the transactions, or any class\nof such persons relative to the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of VMware common stock in the\ntransactions or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the\nprice at which VMware common stock or Broadcom common stock would trade at any future time.\nAs of the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan was not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of\ninterest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of VMware or any other alternative\ntransaction.\nThe terms of the merger agreement were determined through arm\u2019s length negotiations between VMware and\nBroadcom, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the VMware board of directors. J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the VMware board of\ndirectors in its evaluation of the transactions and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the VMware\nboard of directors or management with respect to the transactions or the merger consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the VMware board of directors on May 26, 2022 and contained in the\npresentation delivered to the VMware board of directors on such date in connection with the rendering of such\nopinion and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of\nthe summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended\nto stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be\nread together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full\nnarrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the\nanalyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nVMware Analysis\nPublic Trading Multiples Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of VMware with similar data for\nselected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to the\nbusiness of VMware. These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded\ncompanies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses, may be considered\nsufficiently similar to those of VMware. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical to VMware\nand certain of these companies have financial and operating characteristics that are materially different from those of\nVMware. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial\nand operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies\ndifferently from how they would affect VMware. With respect to the selected companies, J.P. Morgan calculated the\nratio of firm value to unlevered free cash flow for the calendar year 2023\n75\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfor each company based on publicly available financial information and Wall Street estimates per FactSet Research\nSystems as of May 24, 2022 (referred to as FV / uFCF CY23E). For VMware, the companies selected by J.P. Morgan\nwere:\nSelected Company\nCisco Systems, Inc.\nInternational Business Machines Corporation\nMicrosoft Corporation\nOracle Corporation\nSAP SE\nVMware, Inc.(1)\n(1)\nBased on unaffected closing share price as of the Undisturbed Date.\nBased on the results of the above analysis and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan\nselected a FV / uFCF CY23E multiple reference range for VMware of 10.5x - 16.5x. J.P. Morgan then applied that range\nto VMware\u2019s estimated unlevered free cash flow for fiscal year 2024 (used as a proxy for calendar year 2023 per\nVMware management) included in the unaudited prospective financial information provided by VMware management\nand described in the section titled \u201c-Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and\nVMware\u2019s Financial Advisors\u201d, adjusted for the net debt balance of VMware. This analysis indicated a range of\nimplied equity values per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $78.75 to $134.00, which\nwas compared to the unaffected closing price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 on May 20, 2022 (the last\ntrading day prior to public rumors of a potential sale of VMware to Broadcom) (referred to in this section titled \u201c-\nOpinion of J.P. Morgan\u201d as the Undisturbed Date) and the blended offer price per share of $139.69 (referred to in this\nsection titled \u201c- Opinion of J.P. Morgan\u201d as the Blended Offer Price), calculated based on 50:50 proration of the per\nshare cash consideration of $142.50 and the per share stock consideration of 0.25200 Broadcom shares for each share\nof VMware common stock (based on the unaffected closing price per share of Broadcom common stock of $543.19 on\nthe Undisturbed Date).\nSelected Transaction Multiples Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving companies engaged in\nbusinesses that J.P. Morgan judged to be reasonably analogous to the business of VMware or aspects thereof. None\nof the selected transactions reviewed were identical to the transactions. Certain of these transactions may have\ncharacteristics that are materially different from those of the transactions. However, the selected transactions were\nchosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses, may be considered\nsimilar to the transactions. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning\ndifferences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect\nthe transactions differently than they would affect the transactions. For each of the selected transactions, J.P.\nMorgan calculated the ratio of the target company\u2019s firm value to the Wall Street estimates of EBITDA for the twelve\nmonth period following the announcement of the applicable transaction (referred to as FV / NTM EBITDA).\nSpecifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the following transactions:\nAnnouncement Date\nAcquiror\nTarget\nJanuary 2022\nElliott Investment Management L.P. and\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\nCitrix Systems, Inc.\nDecember 2021\nOracle Corporation\nCerner Corporation\nMarch 2021\nSymphony Technology Group, LLC\nMcAfee Corp. (Enterprise Segment)\nAugust 2019\nBroadcom Inc.\nSymantec Corporation (Enterprise\nSecurity Segment)\nJuly 2018\nBroadcom Inc.\nCA, Inc.\nOctober 2015\nSilver Lake Group, L.L.C. and Thoma\nBravo, LLC\nSolarWinds, Inc.\nApril 2015\nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board\nand Permira Advisers LLC\nInformatica Corporation\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnnouncement Date\nAcquiror\nTarget\nDecember 2014\nOntario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan and\nThoma Bravo, LLC\nRiverbed Technology, Inc.\nSeptember 2014\nThoma Bravo, LLC\nCompuware Corporation\nBased on the results of these analyses and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan\nselected a FV / NTM EBITDA multiple reference range of 11.0x to 14.5x. J.P. Morgan then applied that reference range\nto VMware management\u2019s estimated NTM EBITDA, adjusted for the net debt balance of VMware. This analysis\nindicated a range of implied equity values per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of\n$98.00 to $135.00, which was compared to the unaffected closing price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71\nas of the Undisturbed Date and the Blended Offer Price.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value\nper share for VMware common stock on a standalone basis. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of\nevaluating an asset using estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by an asset and taking into\nconsideration the time value of money with respect to such future cash flows by calculating their present value.\nUnlevered free cash flow refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated by an asset without including in\nsuch calculation any debt servicing costs. The current value of the future cash flows generated by an asset obtained\nby discounting those future cash flows back to the present using an appropriate discount rate is referred to as the\npresent value in this section titled \u201c-Opinion of J.P. Morgan.\u201d The present value of all future cash flows generated by\nan asset for periods beyond the projections period is referred to as the terminal value in this section titled \u201c-Opinion\nof J.P. Morgan.\u201d\nJ.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that VMware is expected to generate during the remainder of\nfiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2027 based upon the VMware management financial projections. Based on\nVMware management\u2019s estimates of a 2.5% terminal value growth rate in the industry in which VMware operates, J.P.\nMorgan also calculated a range of terminal values for VMware by applying terminal growth rates ranging from 2.0%\nto 3.0% to the unlevered free cash flows of VMware at the end of fiscal year 2027. The unlevered free cash flows and\nthe range of terminal values were then discounted to present values using a range of discount rates from 7.5% to\n8.5%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of VMware.\nThe present value of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then adjusted for the net\ndebt balance of VMware and divided by VMware\u2019s fully diluted shares outstanding (calculated using the treasury\nstock method). Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan arrived at a range of implied equity values per share\nof VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $109.00 to $159.25, which was compared to the unaffected\nclosing price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 on the Undisturbed Date and the Blended Offer Price.\n77\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBroadcom Analysis\nPublic Trading Multiples Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of Broadcom with similar data for\nselected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to the\nbusiness of Broadcom. These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded\ncompanies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses, may be considered\nsufficiently similar to those of Broadcom. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical to Broadcom\nand certain of these companies have financial and operating characteristics that are materially different from those of\nBroadcom. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in\nfinancial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected\ncompanies differently from how they would affect Broadcom. With respect to the selected companies, J.P. Morgan\ncalculated the ratio of closing share price to earnings per share for the calendar year 2023 for each company based on\npublicly available financial information and Wall Street estimates per FactSet Research Systems as of May 24, 2022,\nwhich is referred to as P/E CY23E. For Broadcom, the companies selected by J.P. Morgan were:\nSelected Company\nBroadcom Inc.(1)\nSemiconductor\nAnalog Devices, Inc.\nMarvell Technology, Inc.\nNXP Semiconductors NV\nTexas Instruments Incorporated\nQualcomm, Inc.\nSoftware\nCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd.\nCisco Systems, Inc.\nF5, Inc.\nInternational Business Machines Corporation\nOracle Corporation\n(1)\nBased on unaffected closing share price as of the Undisturbed Date.\nBased on the results of the above analysis and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan\nselected a P/E CY23E multiple reference range for Broadcom of 13.0x - 16.0x. J.P. Morgan then applied that range to\nBroadcom\u2019s estimated earnings per share for calendar year 2023, as provided by VMware management. This analysis\nindicated a range of implied equity values per share of Broadcom common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of\n$519.50 to $639.25, which was compared to the unaffected closing price per share of Broadcom common stock of\n$543.19 on the Undisturbed Date.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value\nper share for Broadcom common stock on a standalone basis.\nJ.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that Broadcom is expected to generate during the remainder of\nfiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2026 based upon the VMware approved Broadcom financial projections. Based on\nVMware management\u2019s estimates of a 2.5% terminal value growth rate in the industry in which Broadcom operates,\nJ.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for Broadcom by applying terminal growth rates ranging from\n2.0% to 3.0% to the unlevered free cash flows of Broadcom at the end of fiscal year 2026. The unlevered free cash\nflows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values using a range of discount rates from\n8.0% to 9.0%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of\nBroadcom. The present value of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then adjusted for\nthe net debt balance of Broadcom and divided by Broadcom\u2019s fully diluted shares outstanding (calculated using the\ntreasury stock method). Based on the results of\n78\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthis analysis, J.P. Morgan arrived at a range of implied equity values per share of Broadcom common stock, rounded\nto the nearest $0.25, of $532.00 to $747.00, which was compared to the unaffected closing price per share of Broadcom\ncommon stock of $543.19 on the Undisturbed Date (the last trading day prior to public rumors of a potential sale of\nVMware to Broadcom).\nRelative Implied Stock Exchange Ratio Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan compared the implied equity values per share for VMware with those of Broadcom with respect to the\nanalyses referenced in the table below. For each comparison, J.P. Morgan compared the highest equity value per\nshare for VMware to the lowest equity value per share for Broadcom to derive the highest exchange ratio implied by\neach pair of estimates. J.P. Morgan also compared the lowest equity value per share for VMware to the highest equity\nvalue per share for Broadcom to derive the lowest exchange ratio implied by each pair of estimates. The results of this\nanalysis are indicated in the following table:\nImplied Exchange\nRatios\nLow\nHigh\nPublic Trading Multiples Analysis\n0.1232x\n0.2579x\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\n0.1459x\n0.2993x\nThe implied exchange ratio reference ranges for VMware and Broadcom were compared to the equivalent 100% stock\nelection exchange ratio in the transactions of 0.25200 shares of Broadcom common stock per share of VMware\ncommon stock and the unaffected exchange ratio of 0.1762 shares of Broadcom common stock for each share of\nVMware common stock (based on the trading prices of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock on the\nUndisturbed Date, the last trading day prior to public rumors of a potential sale of VMware to Broadcom).\nIntrinsic Value of Merger Consideration - DCF Based\nJ.P. Morgan conducted a value creation analysis that compared the implied equity value of VMware common stock\nderived from J.P. Morgan\u2019s discounted cash flow valuation of VMware on a standalone basis to the value of the cash\nconsideration plus VMware common stockholders\u2019 pro forma ownership of the implied equity value of Broadcom.\nThe pro forma implied equity value of Broadcom was calculated as the sum of: (i) the standalone implied equity value\nof VMware using the midpoint value determined in J.P. Morgan\u2019s discounted cash flow analysis described in the\nsection titled \u201c-VMware Analysis-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,\u201d plus (ii) the standalone implied equity value of\nBroadcom using the midpoint value determined in J.P. Morgan\u2019s discounted cash flow analysis described in the\nsection titled \u201c-Broadcom Analysis-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,\u201d plus (iii) the present value of VMware\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of the net synergies, calculated on an after-tax basis and less transaction expenses and using\na discount rate of 8.0% and a terminal value growth rate of 2.5%. J.P. Morgan then determined the implied pro forma\nequity value of Broadcom attributable to VMware common stockholders based on the equity ownership percentage\nof Broadcom of approximately 12% (on a fully diluted basis) plus the cash consideration to be paid to VMware\ncommon stockholders. This analysis indicated an implied equity value per share to holders of VMware common\nstock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $155.00, and yielded value accretion to holders of VMware common stock of\n$11.3 billion. There can be no assurance, however, that the estimated synergies or estimated costs to achieve such\nsynergies will not be substantially greater or less than VMware management\u2019s estimates.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the\nanalyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not\nnecessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary\nand its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these\nanalyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes\nunderlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or\ncombination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes\nand should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of VMware or Broadcom. The\norder of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P.\nMorgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular\n79\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nweight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis\nor factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan\nconsidered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.\nMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected\ncompanies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to VMware or Broadcom, and none of the\nselected transactions reviewed was identical to the transactions. However, the companies selected were chosen\nbecause they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nanalysis, may be considered similar to those of VMware and Broadcom, as applicable. The transactions selected were\nsimilarly chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be\nconsidered similar to the transactions. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments\nconcerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that\ncould affect the companies compared to VMware and Broadcom and the transactions selected compared to the\ntransactions.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control\npurposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise VMware with respect to the\ntransactions on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection\nwith such matters and its familiarity with VMware and the industries in which it operates.\nFor services rendered in connection with the transactions, VMware has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a fee estimated to\nbe approximately $45 million based on the information available as of the date of announcement of the transactions,\nwhich is payable to J.P. Morgan upon the closing of the transactions, $5.0 million of which was earned by J.P. Morgan\nupon delivery of its opinion. In addition, VMware has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in\nconnection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against\ncertain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement.\nDuring the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial\nor investment banking relationships with VMware, Broadcom, Silver Lake, a significant stockholder of VMware, and\nportfolio companies of Silver Lake for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation.\nSuch services during such period for Broadcom have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on its\nrevolving credit facility in January 2021 and joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities in January 2021.\nSuch services during such period for VMware have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on a\nrevolving credit facility in November 2021, joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities in July 2021, and\nfinancial advisor to VMware on the VMware spin-off in November 2021. Such services during such two-year period\nfor Silver Lake and Silver Lake portfolio companies have included extending loans and providing debt syndication,\nequity underwriting, debt underwriting, private bank lending and capital raising and/or financial advisory services,\nfor which J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have received customary compensation, and, in the case of such services\nprovided to Silver Lake, in amounts not material to J.P. Morgan. In addition, J.P. Morgan\u2019s commercial banking affiliate\nis an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of VMware and Silver Lake portfolio companies, for\nwhich it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. During the two year period preceding delivery\nof its opinion, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from VMware were approximately $45 million, from\nBroadcom were approximately $13 million, and from Silver Lake and its portfolio companies were approximately $128\nmillion. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and\nequity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of VMware or\nBroadcom for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long\nor short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.\nInterests of VMware\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions\nWhen considering the recommendation of the VMware board of directors with respect to the transactions, you\nshould be aware that VMware\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the transactions that\n80\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nare different from, or in addition to, those of VMware stockholders more generally. The VMware board of directors\nwas aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the transactions and considered them in\ndeciding to recommend that VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.\nAs described below, the interests of VMware non-employee directors and executive officers include the following:\n\u2022\naccelerated vesting of restricted stock units held by non-employee directors and conversion of time-based\nrestricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units held by executive officers into\nBroadcom restricted stock units and the \u201cdouble trigger\u201d accelerated vesting of such converted awards\u037e\n\u2022\na seat on Broadcom\u2019s board of directors for one VMware director, to be mutually agreed by VMware and\nBroadcom, following the closing of the transactions\u037e\n\u2022\npotential severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment upon or\nfollowing the closing of the transactions\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe right to indemnification and liability insurance coverage that will survive the closing of the\ntransactions.\nVMware\u2019s executive officers (all of whom are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below) are the\nfollowing: Raghu Raghuram, Zane Rowe, Sumit Dhawan, Jean-Pierre Brulard and Amy Fliegelman Olli. Patrick\nGelsinger and Sanjay Poonen are also deemed to be named executive officers, but because they separated from\nemployment with VMware on February 12, 2021 and August 6, 2021, respectively, they will not receive any benefit\nthat is payable or that may become payable that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the transactions other than the\nmerger consideration in respect of any shares of VMware common stock that they own, and they are not included in\nthe disclosure below.\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in\nthis section, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nA per share price of VMware common stock of $130.09, which is the average closing price of VMware\ncommon stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the first five business days following the first public\nannouncement of the transactions on May 26, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\nThe effective time of the second merger is September 30, 2022\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe employment of each VMware executive officer was terminated by VMware without cause or by the\nexecutive officer for good reason, in either case, immediately following the effective time of the second\nmerger.\nTreatment of VMware Equity Awards\nVMware\u2019s non-employee directors and executive officers hold certain time-based VMware restricted stock unit\nawards and performance-based VMware restricted stock unit awards. No executive officers or non-employee\ndirectors hold any outstanding stock options.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the second merger,\noutstanding VMware restricted stock unit awards and performance-based VMware restricted stock unit awards will\nbe treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes:\n\u2022\neach outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee director will become vested\nand will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each share of VMware\ncommon stock subject to such award, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and 50% of the\nstock consideration\u037e\n\u2022\neach outstanding time-based VMware restricted stock unit award that is not held by a non-employee\ndirector will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange\nratio calculated as (i) the sum of (1) 50% of the stock consideration and (2) 50% of the cash consideration\ndivided by (ii) the Broadcom trading price\u037e and\n81\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\neach outstanding performance-based VMware restricted stock unit award will be converted into a\nBroadcom restricted stock unit award using the same formula described in the above bullet, provided that\n(i) for each such award granted under the VMware operating performance stock unit plan, performance\ngoals will be deemed achieved (1) at the actual level with respect to performance periods completed prior to\nthe closing of the transactions, or (2) at target level with respect to performance periods not completed\nprior to the closing of the transactions\u037e and (ii) for each such award that was granted under the VMware\nTSR performance stock unit plan, performance will be measured at the closing of the transactions based on\nthe actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals based on the value of merger\nconsideration (with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based on the\nBroadcom trading price).\nPursuant to the VMware, Inc. Change in Control Retention Plan (referred to as the CIC Plan) as described below, if a\nVMware executive officer\u2019s employment is terminated by VMware without \u201ccause\u201d or due to the executive officer\u2019s\nresignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d, in each case, within 12 months following a change in control of VMware, all such\nequity awards then held by such executive officer would fully vest upon such termination of employment.\nThese \u201cdouble trigger\u201d vesting provisions applicable to VMware equity awards held by executive officers will\ncontinue to apply to such awards after such awards are converted to Broadcom restricted stock unit awards at the\neffective time of the second merger.\nSee the section titled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware\u2019s Named Executive Officers in\nConnection with the Transactions\u201d below for the estimated value of each VMware named executive officer\u2019s\nunvested VMware equity awards. Based on the assumptions described above under \u201c-Certain Assumptions,\u201d the\nestimated aggregate value of the unvested VMware equity awards held by non-employee directors is $2,071,683.\nChange in Control Retention Plan\nEach VMware executive officer is eligible to receive change in control benefits pursuant to the CIC Plan upon an\ninvoluntary termination without cause or a resignation for good reason, in each case, within 12 months following a\nchange in control of VMware (each such term as defined in the CIC Plan). The transactions constitute a change in\ncontrol for purposes of the CIC Plan.\nUpon a qualifying termination under the CIC Plan, subject to execution of a release of claims in favor of VMware,\neach executive officer is eligible to receive:\n\u2022\na lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times (or 2.0 times for Mr. Raghuram) the sum of the executive officer\u2019s\nhighest annual base salary and highest target annual bonus, in each case measured during the protected\nperiod (as defined in the CIC Plan)\u037e\n\u2022\na lump sum payment equal to the value of 18 months (or 24 months for Mr. Raghuram) of health insurance\npremiums, which are equal to 150% of the monthly cost required to obtain continuation coverage for the\nexecutive officer and their covered dependents\u037e and\n\u2022\nfull accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards.\nThe CIC Plan does not provide for any tax gross-ups. In the event the executive officer would be subject to an excise\ntax under Section 4999 of the Code, the benefits to the executive officer will be reduced to the extent that such\nbenefits do not trigger the excise tax unless the executive officer would retain greater value (on an after-tax basis) by\nreceiving all benefits and paying applicable excise, income and payroll taxes.\nSee the section titled \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware\u2019s Named Executive Officers in\nConnection with the Transactions\u201d below for an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits that each of\nVMware\u2019s named executive officers would receive under the CIC Plan upon a qualifying termination of employment\nimmediately following the effective time of the second merger.\nBoard Seat on the Broadcom Board of Directors\nPursuant to the merger agreement, one member of the VMware board of directors, to be mutually agreed by VMware\nand Broadcom, will be added to Broadcom\u2019s board of directors.\n82\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPotential Employment Arrangements with Broadcom\nAny of VMware\u2019s executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide\nservices to Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs may, prior to, on, or following the closing of the transactions, enter\ninto new individualized compensation arrangements with Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs and may participate in\ncash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs. As of the date of\nthis proxy statement/prospectus, no new individualized compensation arrangements between VMware\u2019s executive\nofficers and Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs have been established.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nUnder the merger agreement, for a period of six years after the effective time of the second merger, the entity into\nwhich VMware converted in connection with its conversion into a limited liability company (referred to as the\nVMware Converted LLC) must, and Broadcom must cause VMware Converted LLC to, indemnify and hold harmless,\nto the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the organizational documents of VMware or its subsidiaries, or\nany indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of the merger agreement that were provided to Broadcom\nprior to the date of the merger agreement, each current and former director and officer of VMware and its subsidiaries\nagainst any costs and expenses in connection with any actual or threatened claims in respect of acts or omissions\noccurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, whether asserted or\nclaimed prior to, at or after the effective time of the second merger, in connection with such person serving as an\nofficer, director, employee or agent of another corporation or of a limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,\ntrust, enterprise or nonprofit entity if such service was at the request of VMware.\nIn addition, for a period of six years following the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom is required to\nmaintain in effect the provisions in the organizational documents of VMware and any indemnification agreements in\nexistence as of the date of the merger agreement that were provided to Broadcom (except to the extent such\nagreement provides for an earlier termination) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors\nand employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence as of the date of the merger agreement.\nAt or prior to the effective time of the second merger, VMware is required to purchase a directors\u2019 and officers\u2019\nliability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance \u201ctail\u201d insurance policy for a period of six years after the effective\ntime of the second merger with respect to matters arising at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, and\nofficers\u2019 liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance prior to the date of the merger agreement.\nFor a more detailed description of the provisions of the merger agreement relating to director and officer\nindemnification and liability insurance, please see the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019\nIndemnification and Insurance.\u201d\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the\nTransactions\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-K, which\nrequires disclosure of information about the compensation that is payable or that may become payable to each named\nexecutive officer of VMware that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the transactions. For additional details\nregarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption \u201c-Interests\nof VMware\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions\u201d above.\nThe amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually\noccur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the\ntable. As a result, the amount, if any, that a named executive officer actually receives in the transactions may\nmaterially differ from the amounts set forth in the table. For purposes of calculating the amounts set forth in the table,\nthe following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nA per share price of VMware common stock of $130.09, which is the average closing price of VMware\ncommon stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the first five business days following the first public\nannouncement of the transactions on May 26, 2022\u037e\n83\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nThe effective time of the second merger is September 30, 2022\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe employment of each named executive officer was terminated by VMware without cause or by the\nnamed executive officer for good reason, in either case, on or immediately following the effective time of the\nsecond merger.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nName\nCash ($)(1)\nEquity ($)(2)\nTotal ($)\nRaghu Raghuram\n$6,070,797\n$46,510,167\n$52,580,964\nZane Rowe\n$2,921,847\n$44,817,956\n$47,739,803\nSumit Dhawan\n$2,868,904\n$20,799,179\n$23,668,083\nJean-Pierre Brulard\n$2,436,015\n$21,471,615\n$23,907,630\nAmy Fliegelman Olli\n$1,997,328\n$18,911,964\n$20,909,292\n(1)\nConsists of (i) a lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times (or 2.0 times for Mr. Raghuram) the sum of the named executive officer\u2019s\nhighest annual base salary and highest target annual bonus, in each case measured during the protected period (as defined in the\nCIC Plan)\u037e and (ii) a lump sum payment equal to the value of 18 months (or 24 months for Mr. Raghuram) of health insurance\npremiums, which are equal to 150% of the monthly cost required to obtain continuation coverage for the executive officer and\nthe executive officer\u2019s covered dependents.

It does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus equivalent document for any\nsuch securities. No offering of any debt securities of Broadcom shall be made except by means of a prospectus\nmeeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom.\n84\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFinancing of the Transactions\nThe transactions are not conditioned upon any financing arrangements or contingencies. Broadcom anticipates that\nthe funds needed to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be derived from a\ncombination of cash on hand and third party debt financing.\nIn connection with its entry into the merger agreement, Broadcom entered into a debt commitment letter on May 26,\n2022 with certain financial institutions, which was amended, restated and superseded in its entirety by an amended\nand restated commitment letter entered into by Broadcom on June 22, 2022 (such amended and restated commitment\nletter, referred to as the debt commitment letter) with certain financial institutions pursuant to which such financial\ninstitutions committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the debt commitment letter, a senior\nunsecured bridge facility in aggregate principal amount of approximately $32 billion. The availability of the bridge\nfacility is conditioned on the consummation of the transactions in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement\n(subject to certain customary exceptions and qualifications) and certain other customary conditions. Broadcom\nexpects to replace the commitments in respect of the bridge facility prior to the consummation of the transactions\nwith the proceeds of the issuance of one or more series of senior unsecured debt securities and/or other incurrences\nof indebtedness (or commitments in respect thereof).\nAccounting Treatment of the Transactions\nThe transactions will be accounted for as a business combination, with Broadcom using the acquisition method of\naccounting in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations, and, accordingly, will\ngenerally result in the recognition of VMware assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. However, as of the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus, the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets\nacquired (including intangible assets, such as completed technology, customer relationships and customer lists, and\ntrademarks and trade names) and liabilities assumed have been performed based on publicly available benchmarking\ninformation as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market participant assumptions, as there are\nlimitations to the type of information that can be exchanged between Broadcom and VMware at this time. Until the\ntransactions are complete, Broadcom will not have complete access to all the relevant information. Differences\nbetween these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur and there can be no assurances\nthat the final valuations will not result in material changes to this preliminary purchase price allocation. The excess of\nthe consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined financial information will be allocated to goodwill. A final determination of these fair values will reflect\nappraisals prepared by independent third-parties and will be based on the actual tangible and intangible assets and\nliabilities that exist as of the acquisition date. The actual allocation of the consideration transferred may differ from\nthe allocation assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and may result in\nadjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following general discussion addresses the material U.S. federal income tax considerations to U.S. holders (as\ndefined below) of VMware common stock that exchange their VMware common stock for the merger consideration in\nthe transactions. The discussion is based on the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative\nrulings, published positions of the IRS and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to\nchange and to differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect), and any such change or interpretation could\naffect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion applies only to\nU.S. holders that hold their VMware common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code\n(generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal taxation that\nmay be relevant to a particular holder in light of his, her or its individual circumstances or to holders subject to\nspecial treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including:\n\u2022\nbanks or other financial institutions,\n\u2022\nmutual funds,\n\u2022\ntax exempt organizations,\n\u2022\ngovernmental agencies or instrumentalities,\n85\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\ninsurance companies,\n\u2022\ndealers in securities or non-U.S. currency,\n\u2022\ntraders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting,\n\u2022\nentities or arrangements treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities (including S corporations)\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes and investors in such partnerships or other pass-through entities\n(including S corporations),\n\u2022\nholders that are not U.S. holders,\n\u2022\ncertain expatriates,\n\u2022\nholders that exercise appraisal rights,\n\u2022\nregulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts,\n\u2022\nbroker-dealers,\n\u2022\nholders liable for the alternative minimum tax,\n\u2022\nholders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar,\n\u2022\nholders who received their VMware common stock through the exercise of employee stock options,\nthrough a tax-qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation,\n\u2022\nholders that hold (or that held, directly or constructively, at any time during the five-year period ending on\nthe date of the disposition of such holder\u2019s VMware common stock pursuant to the transactions) 5% or\nmore of VMware common stock (by vote or value),\n\u2022\nholders required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being\nrecognized on an \u201capplicable financial statement,\u201d and\n\u2022\nholders who hold VMware common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion\ntransaction or other integrated investment.\nIn addition, this discussion does not address any state, local or foreign tax considerations of the transactions, nor\ndoes it address the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the Foreign Account Tax\nCompliance Act (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements\nentered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith) or any U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the\nU.S. federal income tax.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of VMware common stock who is, for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes:\n(i)\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n(ii)\na corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United\nStates, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n(iii) an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source\u037e or\n(iv) a trust that (A) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all substantial\ndecisions of which are subject to the control of one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of\nSection 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (B) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf a partnership, including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nholds shares of VMware common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will\ngenerally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, such partners and\npartnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the particular tax considerations of the transactions to them.\n86\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEach holder of VMware common stock should consult his, her or its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax\nconsiderations of the transactions to such holder. Holders of VMware common stock that are not U.S. holders\nshould consult their own tax advisors regarding the possibility that, in the event the applicable withholding agent\nis unable to determine whether any cash consideration paid to them in the transactions should be treated as a\ndividend for applicable U.S. federal income tax purposes, such withholding agent may withhold U.S. federal\nwithholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on\nthe entire amount of any cash consideration payable to such non-U.S. holder in the transactions, and such non-\nU.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the possible desirability and timing of selling any shares\nof VMware common stock or Broadcom common stock that they own.\nIn General\nThe obligation of VMware to complete the transactions is conditioned upon the delivery by Gibson Dunn, counsel to\nVMware (or other nationally recognized tax counsel or Big 4 accounting firm as may be reasonably acceptable to\nVMware) of the Tax Opinion. In addition, in connection with the filing of the registration statement of which this\ndocument is a part, Gibson Dunn has delivered an opinion to VMware that the transactions will qualify for the\nIntended Tax Treatment. Each of these tax opinions is or will be based on factual representations contained in\nofficer\u2019s certificates provided by Broadcom and VMware, representations and covenants contained in the merger\nagreement, and on certain customary factual assumptions, all of which must continue to be true and accurate as of\nthe consummation of the transactions. If any of the representations, covenants or assumptions upon which the tax\nopinions are or will be based is inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the\ntransactions could be materially different from those discussed below. None of these opinions is binding on the IRS\nor the courts, and neither Broadcom nor VMware intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations of the transactions. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert,\nor that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of those set forth below.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transactions to U.S. Holders\nVMware has received a legal opinion from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, U.S. tax counsel to VMware, to the effect\nthat, under currently applicable U.S. federal income tax law, (1) the first merger and the LLC conversion, taken\ntogether, will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and (2) the second\nmerger and the third merger, taken together, will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)\n(A) of the Code. Additionally, unless otherwise noted in the following discussion, and subject to the limitations,\nqualifications, and assumptions described herein and set forth in the opinion filed as Exhibit 8.1 hereto, the\ndiscussion in this subsection titled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences-U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the transactions to U.S. Holders\u201d constitutes the opinion of Gibson Dunn, counsel to VMware,\ninsofar as it contains legal conclusions with respect to matters of U.S. federal income tax law.\nThe U.S. federal income tax considerations of the transactions to a U.S. holder generally will depend on whether the\nU.S. holder exchanges its VMware common stock for cash consideration, stock consideration or a combination of\ncash consideration and stock consideration.\nExchange Solely for Cash\nThe exchange of shares of VMware common stock solely for cash generally will result in the recognition of gain or\nloss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in\nthe shares of VMware common stock surrendered. Such gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if\nthe U.S. holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the VMware common stock surrendered is more than one year at the\neffective time of the second merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals,\ngenerally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to\nlimitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of VMware common stock at different times or different\nprices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each\nblock of VMware common stock. In certain circumstances, if a U.S. holder actually or constructively owns Broadcom\ncommon stock after the transactions, the cash consideration received could be treated as having the effect of a\ndistribution of a dividend under the\n87\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntests set forth in Section 302 of the Code, in which case such U.S. holder may have dividend income up to the amount\nof the cash consideration received. Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends primarily upon the\nparticular circumstances of a U.S. holder, including the application of certain constructive ownership rules, U.S.\nholders that actually or constructively own Broadcom common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the\napplication of the foregoing rules to their particular circumstances.\nU.S. holders electing to receive solely cash consideration in the transactions may be subject to proration (as\ndescribed in the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Effects of the Transactions-Proration and Allocation of\nMerger Consideration.\u201d), which may result in the receipt of a portion of the merger consideration in stock\nconsideration, in addition to cash consideration. See \u201c-Exchange for Broadcom Common Stock and Cash\u201d for a\ngeneral description of the U.S. federal income tax considerations to U.S. holders of the receipt of stock consideration\nand cash consideration.\nExchange Solely for Broadcom Common Stock\nIf, pursuant to the transactions, a U.S. holder exchanges all of its shares of VMware common stock solely for shares\nof Broadcom common stock, that U.S. holder generally will not recognize any gain or loss, except with respect to cash\nreceived in lieu of a fractional share of Broadcom common stock (as discussed in \u201c-Cash in Lieu of a Fractional\nShare\u201d). The aggregate adjusted tax basis in the shares of Broadcom common stock received in the transactions\n(including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described in \u201c-Cash in Lieu of a Fractional Share\u201d) will\nbe equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of VMware common stock surrendered, and the holding\nperiod of the shares of Broadcom common stock received in the transactions (including fractional shares deemed\nreceived and redeemed as described in \u201c-Cash in Lieu of a Fractional Share\u201d) will include the holding period of the\nshares of VMware common stock surrendered. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of VMware\ncommon stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder should consult his, her or its tax advisor as to\nthe determination of the tax bases and holding periods of the Broadcom common stock received in the transactions.\nU.S. holders electing to receive solely stock consideration in the transactions may be subject to proration (as\ndescribed in the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Effects of the Transactions-Proration and Allocation of\nMerger Consideration.\u201d), which may result in the receipt of a portion of the merger consideration in cash\nconsideration, in addition to the stock consideration. See \u201c-Exchange for Broadcom Common Stock and Cash\u201d for a\ngeneral description of the U.S. federal income tax considerations to U.S. holders of the receipt of stock consideration\nand cash consideration.\nExchange for Broadcom Common Stock and Cash\nA U.S. holder who receives a combination of Broadcom common stock and cash (other than cash in lieu of a\nfractional share of Broadcom common stock) pursuant to the transactions generally will recognize gain (but not loss)\nin an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the sum of the amount of the cash (other than cash in lieu of a fractional share\nof Broadcom common stock) and the fair market value of the Broadcom common stock received, minus that U.S.\nholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of VMware common stock surrendered in exchange therefor and (2) the\namount of cash received.\nIf a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of VMware common stock at different times or different prices, any\ngain or loss may be determined separately for each block of shares and such U.S. holder\u2019s basis and holding period\nin its shares of Broadcom common stock may be determined with reference to each block of shares of VMware\ncommon stock. Any such U.S. holder should consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding the manner in which the\ncash consideration and stock consideration should be allocated among different blocks of shares of VMware\ncommon stock surrendered, including the ability to specifically identify shares of VMware common stock exchanged\nfor the cash consideration, and the determination of the tax bases and holding periods of the Broadcom common\nstock received.\nAny recognized gain will generally be long-term capital gain if the U.S. holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the\nshares of VMware common stock surrendered is more than one year at the effective time of the second merger. Long-\nterm capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, generally are subject to U.S. federal income\ntax at preferential rates. In certain circumstances, if a U.S. holder actually or constructively owns Broadcom common\nstock other than Broadcom common stock received pursuant to the transactions, the recognized gain could be\ntreated as having the effect of the distribution of a dividend under the tests set forth in\n88\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSection 302 of the Code, in which case such gain would be treated as dividend income. Because the possibility of\ndividend treatment depends upon the particular circumstances of a U.S. holder, including the application of certain\nconstructive ownership rules, U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the\nforegoing rules to their particular circumstances.\nThe aggregate tax basis of the Broadcom common stock received (including fractional shares deemed received and\nredeemed as described in \u201c-Cash in Lieu of a Fractional Share\u201d) will be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of\nthe shares of VMware common stock surrendered, reduced by the amount of cash consideration received by the U.S.\nholder (excluding any cash in lieu of a fractional share) and increased by the amount of gain (regardless of whether\nsuch gain is classified as capital gain or dividend income, as discussed above, but excluding any gain recognized\nwith respect to cash in lieu of a fractional share), if any, recognized by the U.S. holder on the exchange. The holding\nperiod of the Broadcom common stock received in the transactions (including fractional shares deemed received and\nredeemed as described below) will include the holding period of the shares of VMware common stock surrendered.\nCash in Lieu of a Fractional Share\nU.S. holders who receive cash in lieu of a fractional share of Broadcom common stock will generally be treated as\nhaving received such fractional share and then as having received such cash in redemption of the fractional share.\nGain or loss generally will be recognized based on the difference between the amount of cash in lieu of the fractional\nshare and the tax basis allocated to such fractional share. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or\nloss if the holding period for such shares is more than one year at the effective time of the second merger. Long-term\ncapital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax\nat preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to payments made in\nconnection with the transactions. Backup withholding will not apply, however, if the recipient provides proof of an\napplicable exemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with all applicable\ncertification requirements. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld may be allowed as a\nrefund or credit against such U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is\ntimely furnished to the IRS.\nTHIS SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTIONS\nIS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS OF VMWARE COMMON\nSTOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSIDERATIONS TO\nTHEM OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE\nAPPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.\nRegulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Transactions\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters. The transactions are subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which\nprevents VMware and Broadcom from completing the transactions until required information and materials are\nfurnished to the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and the FTC and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires.\nA transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting\nperiod following the parties\u2019 filings of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that\nwaiting period. The parties may also choose to voluntarily re-start the initial 30-calendar-day waiting period by\nfollowing certain prescribed procedures. After the expiration of the initial waiting period (or the re-started initial\nwaiting period), the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC may issue a Request for Additional Information and\nDocumentary Material (referred to as a second request). If a second request is issued, the parties may not complete\nthe transactions until they substantially comply with the second request and observe a second 30-calendar-day\nwaiting period, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier, or the parties commit not to close for some additional\nperiod of time. VMware and Broadcom submitted the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act on\nJune 10, 2022. On July 11, 2022 VMware and Broadcom each received a request for additional information, often\nreferred to as a \u201csecond request,\u201d from the FTC under the HSR Act.\n89\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nForeign Regulatory Clearances. The completion of the transactions is subject to clearance under the antitrust laws\nof the European Union and certain other jurisdictions, and the parties will file or have filed merger notifications\npursuant to antitrust and competition laws with the appropriate regulators in the European Union and certain other\njurisdictions. The parties must observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary approvals, clearances\nor consents pursuant to certain of these foreign laws before completing the transactions.\nOther state or foreign antitrust, competition and foreign investment authorities may take action under the laws of\ntheir jurisdictions, which could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the transactions. For more information\nabout regulatory approvals relating to the transactions, see the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to\nthe Transactions.\u201d\nAlthough the parties expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, the parties cannot\nassure you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the\ngranting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the\ncompletion of the transactions, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or\nobligations or enter into supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the\ntransactions not being satisfied.\nExchange of Shares\u037e Elections as to Form of Consideration\nAt the effective time of the second merger, each issued and outstanding share of VMware common stock (other than\n(i) cancelled shares, (ii) dissenting shares and (iii) excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive, at the\nelection of the stockholder and subject to proration, $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.25200 of a share of\nBroadcom common stock. A VMware stockholder may elect a different form of consideration for each share such\nVMware stockholder owns. A VMware stockholder may elect to receive (i) solely the cash consideration, (ii) solely\nthe stock consideration or (iii) if a VMware stockholder owns more than one share, a combination of the cash\nconsideration for a selected number of shares and the stock consideration for the remaining number of shares. The\nstockholder election will be subject to the election of other VMware stockholders and a proration mechanism, such\nthat the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive the cash consideration, and the total\nnumber of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive the stock consideration, will, in each case, be equal to\n50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time of the second merger. For example, if you elect to receive solely the cash consideration or solely the\nstock consideration, and all other VMware stockholders make the same election, the consideration you receive will\nvary to the maximum extent possible compared to your original election. In such instance, you would receive the cash\nconsideration in exchange for 50% of your shares of VMware common stock and the stock consideration in exchange\nfor 50% of your shares of VMware common stock. The following examples illustrate the proration mechanism in the\ncase of an oversubscription of either the cash consideration or the stock consideration (both if you elect solely the\noversubscribed form of merger consideration and if you elect a combination of the cash consideration and the stock\nconsideration). Note that for illustrative purposes, the following examples do not round shares to the nearest whole\nnumber.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the cash consideration, and\n80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect\nto receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,\nyou will receive cash in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common\nstock in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 55 shares\nand the stock consideration for 45 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive\ncash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the\noutstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 34.375 of your\nshares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 65.625 of your shares of\nVMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the stock consideration, and\n80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock, 15% of the\n90\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\noutstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make\nan election, you will receive cash in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and\nBroadcom common stock in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.\n\u2022\nIf you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 45 shares\nand the stock consideration for 55 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive\nBroadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the\noutstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 65.625 of your\nshares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 34.375 of your shares of\nVMware common stock.\nNo fractional shares of Broadcom common stock will be issued in the second merger, and holders of VMware\ncommon stock will instead receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom common stock.\nPrior to the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom will enter into an exchange agent agreement with a bank or\ntrust company reasonably acceptable to VMware. At or prior to the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom\nwill deposit (i) cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash consideration\nand, to the extent determinable, cash in lieu of fractional shares and (ii) evidence of Broadcom common stock in book-\nentry form representing the number of shares of Broadcom common stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate stock\nconsideration.\nAs described above, VMware stockholders will not receive any fractional shares of Broadcom common stock in the\nsecond merger. Instead, a VMware stockholder who otherwise would have received a fractional share of Broadcom\ncommon stock will be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount determined by\nmultiplying (i) the last reported sale price of Broadcom common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (as\nreported in the Wall Street Journal, or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by\nBroadcom and VMware) on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the effective time of the second merger\nby (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Broadcom common stock held by such holder at\nthe effective time of the second merger and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form)\nof Broadcom common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.\nIf a dividend or other distribution is declared with respect to shares of Broadcom common stock with a record date\nafter the effective time of the second merger, such declaration will include a dividend or other distribution in respect\nof all shares of Broadcom common stock issuable pursuant to the merger agreement.\nThe merger agreement provides that VMware stockholders will be provided with an election form and other\ncustomary transmittal materials. The election form will allow each holder of VMware common stock to specify (i) the\nnumber of shares of VMware common stock owned by such holder with respect to which such holder desires to\nreceive the cash consideration and (ii) the number of shares of VMware common stock owned by such holder with\nrespect to which such holder desires to receive the stock consideration.\nBroadcom and VMware will initially make available and mail the election form at least 20 business days prior to the\nanticipated election deadline to holders of record as of the fifth business day prior to such mailing date. Following\nthe mailing date, Broadcom and VMware will use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible an\nelection form to any stockholder who requests an election form prior to the election deadline. The election deadline\nwill be 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the exchange agent is located) on the date that is\nfive business days prior to Broadcom\u2019s good faith estimate of the closing date or such other date as may be mutually\nagreed to by the parties. Broadcom and VMware will cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to\neach of them announcing the election deadline at least three business days prior to the election deadline.\nTo make a valid election, a VMware stockholder must submit to the exchange agent a properly completed and signed\nelection form (including duly executed transmittal materials included in the election form). The election form must also\nbe accompanied by any certificates representing all certificated shares of VMware common stock to which such\nelection form relates (or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such\nelection, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the\nUnited States).\n91\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA VMware stockholder may change or revoke an election by providing written notice to the exchange agent, which\nmust be received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline, accompanied by a properly completed and\nsigned revised election form, or by withdrawing his or her shares of VMware common stock previously deposited\nwith the exchange agent. If any election is not properly made with respect to any shares of VMware common stock,\nsuch election will be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of VMware common stock covered by such election\nwill be deemed to be non-election shares, unless a proper election is subsequently timely made.\nAfter the effective time of the second merger, shares of VMware common stock will no longer be outstanding, will be\ncancelled and will cease to exist and each certificate or book entry share that previously represented shares of\nVMware common stock (other than (i) cancelled shares, (ii) dissenting shares and (iii) excluded shares) will represent\nonly the right to receive the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement, cash in lieu of fractional shares\nand unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, as described above. With respect to such shares of Broadcom\ncommon stock deliverable upon the surrender of VMware stock certificates or book-entry shares, until holders of\nsuch VMware stock certificates or book-entry shares have properly surrendered such stock certificates or book-entry\nshares to the exchange agent (or another agent appointed by Broadcom) for exchange, along with a duly completed\nletter of transmittal in the case of holders of certificates and any other documents as may customarily be required by\nthe exchange agent, those holders will not receive the merger consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and\nany dividends or distributions that become due to the holders of converted VMware common stock.\nPromptly (and within five business days) after the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom will cause the\nexchange agent to mail to each record holder of certificates who has not previously submitted an election notice with\nduly executed transmittal materials and whose shares of VMware common stock were converted in the second merger\ninto the right to receive the merger consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering VMware\nshare certificates in exchange for payment of the merger consideration. Holders of book-entry shares whose shares of\nVMware common stock were converted in the second merger into the right to receive the merger consideration will\nnot be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent to receive the merger\nconsideration. Upon surrender of VMware share certificates or book-entry shares and a duly executed letter of\ntransmittal in the case of holders of certificates to the exchange agent (or another agent appointed by Broadcom) in\ncompliance with the instructions for surrender, such holders will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and\nany fractional share cash amounts.\nBroadcom will instruct the exchange agent to accept the certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and\nconditions as the exchange agent may impose, to effect an orderly exchange in accordance with normal exchange\npractices. The time that any individual VMware stockholder receives its, his or her merger consideration will vary\ndepending on the underlying arrangements through which such VMware stockholder holds its, his or her shares of\nVMware common stock.\nLitigation Relating to the Transactions\nIn connection with the transactions, five complaints have been filed as individual actions in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York and one complaint has been filed as an individual action in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaints are captioned as follows: (1) Stein v.\nVMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-06307 (filed July 25, 2022)\u037e (2) O\u2019Dell v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-06352 (filed July 26,\n2022)\u037e (3) Whitfield v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-06527 (filed August 1, 2022)\u037e (4) Waterman v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-\ncv-06533 (filed August 2, 2022)\u037e (5) Laufer v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-5146 (filed September 9, 2022)\u037e and (6)\nChapman v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-7735 (filed September 11, 2022) (collectively referred to as the Complaints).\nThe Complaints generally allege that this proxy statement/prospectus misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly\nmaterial information. The Complaints assert violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9\npromulgated thereunder against VMware and the members of the VMware board of directors. The Complaints seek,\namong other things\u037e an injunction enjoining the consummation of the transactions\u037e direction that a registration\nstatement is disseminated, including certain additional information, rescission or rescissory damages in the event the\ntransactions are consummated\u037e declaration that defendants violated Section 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act,\nas well as SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder\u037e direction that defendants account for all damages suffered as a\nresult of any misconduct\u037e costs of the action,\n92\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nincluding plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and experts\u2019 fees\u037e and other relief the court may deem just and proper. In addition\nto the Complaints, beginning on July 20, 2022, certain purported stockholders of VMware sent demand letters\n(referred to as the Demands, and together with the Complaints, the Matters) alleging similar deficiencies regarding the\ndisclosures made in this proxy statement/prospectus, and seek additional disclosures to address those purported\ndeficiencies.\nVMware cannot predict the outcomes of the Matters. VMware management believes that the Matters are without\nmerit and intends to vigorously defend against the Matters and any subsequent similar demands or filed actions. If\nadditional similar complaints are filed or demands sent, absent new or significantly different allegations, VMware will\nnot necessarily disclose such additional filings or demands.\nDividend Policy\nBroadcom currently pays regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. Broadcom most recently paid a cash\ndividend on June 30, 2022, of $4.10 per share. Broadcom currently expects to continue to pay quarterly cash\ndividends, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by Broadcom\u2019s board of directors. The\npayment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including Broadcom\u2019s financial performance,\noutlook and liquidity.\nSubsequent to VMware\u2019s initial public offering in August 2007, VMware has not declared or paid regular cash\ndividends on its common stock.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, during the period before the closing of the transactions, Broadcom is not\npermitted to pay any special cash dividends on its capital stock other than regular, quarterly cash dividends\n(including any increases to current dividend rates approved by the Broadcom board in good faith) and VMware is\nnot permitted to pay any dividends or make any distributions on its capital stock, in each case without the consent of\nBroadcom.\nListing of Broadcom Common Stock\u037e Delisting of VMware Common Stock\nIt is a condition to the consummation of the transactions that the shares of Broadcom common stock to be issued to\nVMware stockholders in the second merger be approved for listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to\nofficial notice of issuance. As a result of the second merger, shares of VMware common stock will cease to be listed\non the New York Stock Exchange.\n93\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n THE MERGER AGREEMENT",

            "text": "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following describes the material provisions of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this\nproxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the material provisions of the\nmerger agreement below and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to\nthe merger agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information\nabout the merger agreement that is important to you. Broadcom and VMware encourage you to read carefully the\nmerger agreement in its entirety before making any decisions regarding the merger as it is the legal document\ngoverning the transactions.\nExplanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement\nThe merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding\nthe terms of the merger agreement. Broadcom and VMware are responsible for considering whether additional\ndisclosure of material information is required to make the statements in this proxy statement/prospectus not\nmisleading. Factual disclosures about Broadcom and VMware contained in this proxy statement/prospectus or\nBroadcom\u2019s or VMware\u2019s public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures\nabout Broadcom or VMware contained in the merger agreement and described in the summary. The representations,\nwarranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by Broadcom, Broadcom Merger Subs and VMware,\nHoldco and Merger Sub 1 are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by the parties to the merger\nagreement in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to\nbear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger\nagreement, and were negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the merger\nagreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a\ncontractual standard of materiality that may be different from that generally relevant to stockholders or applicable\nto reports and documents filed with the SEC, and in some cases are qualified by confidential disclosures that were\nmade by each party to the other, which disclosures are not publicly disclosed. The representations and warranties\nin the merger agreement will not survive the completion of the transactions. Moreover, information concerning the\nsubject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the merger agreement. For\nthe foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should\nnot be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See the\nsection titled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nTransactions\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with Delaware law:\n\u2022\nthe first merger will occur in which Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into VMware, and VMware will\nsurvive the first merger and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco and the separate corporate\nexistence of Merger Sub 1 will cease\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the effective time of the first merger, the LLC conversion will occur in which VMware will be\nconverted into a Delaware limited liability company in accordance with Section 266 of the DGCL and\nSection 18-214 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the effective time of the LLC conversion, the second merger will occur in which Merger Sub 2 will\nmerge with and into Holdco, and Holdco will survive the second merger and become a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Broadcom and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub 2 will cease\u037e and\n\u2022\nfollowing the effective time of the second merger, the third merger will occur in which Holdco will merge\nwith and into Merger Sub 3, and Merger Sub 3 will survive the third merger as a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Broadcom and the separate corporate existence of Holdco will cease.\nWithin 60 business days of the date of the merger agreement, Broadcom may elect, with VMware\u2019s prior written\nconsent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to implement an alternative transaction\n94TABLE OF CONTENTS\nstructure. Under this alternative transaction structure, the first merger and the LLC conversion will be eliminated, and\nthe structure of the second merger will be modified such that it consists of Merger Sub 2 merging with and into\nVMware, with VMware surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom and the separate existence of Merger\nSub 2 ceasing and the third merger will be modified such that it consists of the surviving corporation in the second\nmerger merging with and into Merger Sub 3, with Merger Sub 3 surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom.\nIf the alternative transaction structure is adopted, the parties will enter into an amendment to the merger agreement\nimplementing the alternative transaction structure.\nClosing\u037e Effective Time\nUnless the parties otherwise agree in writing, the closing of the transactions will occur on the third business day\nfollowing the date on which all conditions to the transactions set forth in the merger agreement have been satisfied,\nor, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be\nsatisfied at the closing of the transactions, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law,\nwaiver of such conditions at the closing of the transactions). The first merger will be effective as of 11:59 p.m., New\nYork City time, on the business day prior to the closing date. The second merger will be effective at 8:30 a.m., New\nYork City time, on the closing date or at such other date and time as is agreed to by the parties and specified in the\ncertificate of merger for the second merger.\nIn the event that, pursuant to the terms described in the immediately preceding paragraph, the closing of the\ntransactions would occur on a date that is within 35 days of the last day of Broadcom\u2019s fiscal year or any other\nBroadcom fiscal quarter, Broadcom may irrevocably elect to defer the closing of the transactions until the first\nbusiness day of the immediately succeeding fiscal year or fiscal quarter, respectively, unless another date or time is\nagreed to in writing by VMware and Broadcom. Upon making such written election, (x) each of the conditions to the\nobligations of Broadcom and Broadcom Merger Subs to consummate the transactions (related to accuracy of\nVMware\u2019s, Holdco\u2019s and Merger Sub 1\u2019s representations and warranties, compliance with covenants and absence of\na material adverse effect) will be deemed to have been irrevocably fulfilled, other than with respect to a willful breach\nby VMware, Holdco or Merger Sub 1 occurring after the date of delivery of such written election, (y) Broadcom will\nbe deemed to have irrevocably waived its right to terminate the merger agreement as a result of VMware\u2019s, Holdco\u2019s\nor Merger Sub 1\u2019s breach, failure to perform or violation of covenants or agreements under the merger agreement or\nthe inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties of VMware, Holdco or Merger Sub 1 in the merger\nagreement, other than with respect to a willful breach by VMware, Holdco or Merger Sub 1 occurring after the date of\ndelivery of such written election, and (z) until the fifth business day of the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter,\nneither Broadcom nor VMware will have the right to terminate the merger agreement as a result of the effective time of\nthe merger not having occurred prior to the outside date.\nEffects of the Transactions\nAt the effective time of the first merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately\nprior to the effective time of the first merger will be converted into one share of common stock of Holdco, and each\noutstanding VMware equity award will be converted into a Holdco award that relates to a number of shares of\nHoldco common stock that is equal to the number of shares of VMware common stock that were subject to such\naward prior to such conversion. All terms and conditions applicable to each such VMware security (including any\nVMware equity awards) immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger will, except as described in the\nimmediately preceding sentence, remain in effect immediately after the effective time of the first merger. After the\nconsummation of the first merger, all references in this proxy statement/prospectus to VMware, including VMware\ncommon stock, VMware stock options, VMware restricted stock unit awards, VMware equity awards and other\nsecurities of VMware will be deemed, where applicable, to be references to Holdco and the same securities of Holdco,\nand all references to VMware stockholders will be deemed to be references to common stockholders of VMware.\nAt the effective time of the LLC conversion, each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of VMware (then a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Holdco) will be converted into one limited liability company interest of VMware\nConverted LLC, the entity into which VMware will have converted in connection with its conversion into a limited\nliability company.\n95\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt the effective time of the second merger, subject to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom\ncommon stock as described below under \u201c-No Fractional Shares\u201d and proration as described below under \u201c-Proration\nand Allocation of Merger Consideration,\u201d each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately\nprior to the effective time of the second merger, other than cancelled shares, dissenting shares and excluded shares\nas described below under \u201c-Cancellation of Certain VMware Common Stock,\u201d \u201c-Shares of Dissenting Stockholders,\u201d\nand \u201c-Conversion of Excluded Shares,\u201d respectively, will be converted into the right to receive, without interest:\n\u2022\nfor each share of VMware common stock with respect to which an election to receive cash (referred to as a\ncash election) has been properly made and not revoked (referred to as a cash election share), $142.50 in\ncash (referred to as the cash consideration)\u037e\n\u2022\nfor each share of VMware common stock with respect to which an election to receive Broadcom common\nstock (referred to as a stock election) has been properly made and not revoked (referred to as a stock\nelection share), 0.25200 of a share of Broadcom common stock (referred to as the stock consideration)\u037e and\n\u2022\nfor each share of VMware common stock that is not a cash election share or a stock election share (referred\nto as a non-election share), the right to receive cash consideration or stock consideration as determined in\naccordance with the proration methodology described below under \u201c-Proration and Allocation of Merger\nConsideration.\u201d\nThe stock consideration will be appropriately adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, subdivision,\nconsolidation, combination or reclassification with respect to the outstanding shares of Broadcom common stock,\nVMware common stock or Holdco common stock, payment of a stock dividend or other distribution in respect of\nsuch shares or the changing of such shares into other securities, in each case that occurs prior to the effective time\nof the second merger.\nAt the effective time of the third merger, each share of capital stock of Holdco (then a wholly owned subsidiary of\nBroadcom) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the third merger will be converted into\none limited liability company interest of Merger Sub 3.\nNo Fractional Shares\nCash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom common stock as described in the next sentence. Each\nholder of VMware common stock that would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Broadcom\ncommon stock in the second merger will instead receive a cash payment equal to the product obtained by multiplying\n(i) the fraction of a share of Broadcom common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (accounting\nfor all shares of VMware common stock held by such holder at the effective time of the second merger), rounded to\nthe nearest one-thousandth of one share, by (ii) the last reported sale price of Broadcom common stock on The\nNasdaq Global Select Market (as reported in the Wall Street Journal, or if not reported therein, in another\nauthoritative source mutually selected by Broadcom and VMware) on the last complete trading day prior to the date\nof the effective time of the second merger.\nProration and Allocation of Merger Consideration\nThe total number of shares of VMware common stock to be entitled to receive the cash consideration, referred to as\nthe maximum cash share number, will be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock\nissued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger (other than any cancelled shares\nand excluded shares), and the total number of shares of VMware common stock to be entitled to receive the stock\nconsideration will be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger (other than any cancelled shares and\nexcluded shares). Accordingly, depending on the elections made by other holders of VMware common stock, a\nholder of VMware common stock may receive a portion of the merger consideration in the form such holder did not\nelect.\nWithin five business days after the effective time of the second merger, VMware will cause the exchange agent for the\npayment of the merger consideration, referred to as the exchange agent, to effect the allocation among holders of\nVMware common stock of rights to receive the cash consideration and the stock consideration as follows (with the\nexchange agent to determine, consistent with the immediately preceding paragraph, whether\n96\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfractions of cash election shares, stock election shares and non-election shares, as applicable, will be rounded up or\ndown):\nOversubscription of Cash Election Option. If the aggregate number of cash election shares (including, for this\npurpose, dissenting shares as of the effective time), referred to as the cash election number, equals or exceeds the\nmaximum cash share number, then\n\u2022\nthe cash election shares of each holder of such cash election shares will be converted into the right to\nreceive the cash consideration in respect of that number of cash election shares equal to the product\nobtained by multiplying (i) the number of cash election shares held by such holder by (ii) a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the maximum cash share number and the denominator of which is the cash election\nnumber, with the remaining number of such holder\u2019s cash election shares being converted into the right to\nreceive the stock consideration\u037e\n\u2022\nall stock election shares will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration\u037e and\n\u2022\nall non-election shares will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration.\nUndersubscription of Cash Election Option. If the cash election number is less than the maximum cash share number\n(the amount by which the maximum cash share number exceeds the cash election number referred to as the shortfall\nnumber), then\n\u2022\nall cash election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration\u037e\n\u2022\nif the shortfall number is less than or equal to the number of non-election shares, then all stock election\nshares will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration, and the non-election shares of\neach holder of such non-election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration in\nrespect of that number of non-election shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number\nof non-election shares held by such holder by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the shortfall number\nand the denominator of which is the total number of non-election shares, with the remaining number of\nsuch holder\u2019s non-election shares being converted into the right to receive the stock consideration\u037e and\n\u2022\nif the shortfall number exceeds the number of non-election shares, then all non-election shares will be\nconverted into the right to receive the cash consideration, and stock election shares of each holder of such\nstock election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration in respect of that\nnumber of stock election shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of stock\nelection shares held by such holder by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the\nshortfall number exceeds the total number of non-election shares, and the denominator of which is the total\nnumber of stock election shares, with the remaining number of such holder\u2019s stock election shares being\nconverted into the right to receive the stock consideration.\nCancellation of Certain VMware Common Stock\nAt the effective time of the second merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately\nprior to the effective time of the second merger that is owned or held in treasury by VMware or owned by Merger Sub\n2 or in the treasury of VMware as the surviving company in the first merger, referred to as cancelled shares, will\nautomatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. No consideration will be delivered in exchange for any cancelled\nshares.\nConversion of Excluded Shares\nEach share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second\nmerger that is owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of VMware, referred to as excluded shares, will automatically\nbe converted into the right to receive, without interest, the stock consideration.\nShares of Dissenting Stockholders\nShares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger\nand held by a person, referred to as a dissenting stockholder, (i) who did not vote in favor of approval of the merger\nagreement proposal, (ii) who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of\n97\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsuch shares of VMware common stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (iii) who complies in all respects with\nthe provisions of the DGCL concerning the rights of VMware stockholders to require payment by the surviving\ncorporation of the \u201cfair value\u201d of such shares of VMware common stock, referred as dissenting shares, will not be\nconverted into the right to receive the merger consideration.\nInstead, if the second merger is consummated, then dissenting shares will represent the right to receive whatever\nconsideration may be determined to be due to such dissenting stockholder under Section 262 of the DGCL. If any\ndissenting stockholder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Section\n262 or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section\n262, dissenting shares held by such dissenting stockholder will be treated as though such dissenting shares had\nbeen converted into the right to receive the merger consideration as of the effective time of the second merger.\nHowever, in such case, the proposed dissenting shares will be deemed to be cash election shares, unless such holder\nthereafter otherwise make a timely election. If any holder of proposed dissenting shares fails to perfect or has\neffectively withdrawn, waived or lost such holder\u2019s right to dissent from the adoption of the merger agreement after\nthe election deadline, each of such holder\u2019s shares of VMware common stock will be deemed to have been converted\ninto the right to receive the merger consideration and will be treated as cash election shares.

If any election is not properly made with respect to any shares of VMware common stock (none of Broadcom,\nVMware or the exchange agent being under any duty to notify any holder of any such defect), such election will be\ndeemed to be not in effect, and the shares of VMware common stock covered by such election will be deemed to be\nnon-election shares, unless a proper election is thereafter timely made.\nAny holder may, at any time during the election period, revoke his, her or its election by written notice received by\nthe exchange agent prior to the election deadline or by withdrawal prior to the election deadline of his, her or its\ncertificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the exchange agent.

Such cash and book-entry shares, together with any dividends or other distributions with\nrespect to such book-entry shares, are referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the exchange fund. No such\ndeposits will be required to be made with respect to any dissenting shares.\nExchange of VMware Share Certificates and Book-Entry VMware Shares\nPromptly (and within five business days) after the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom will cause the\nexchange agent to mail to each record holder of certificates who has not previously submitted an election notice with\nduly executed transmittal materials and whose shares of VMware common stock were converted in the second merger\ninto the right to receive the merger consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering VMware\nshare certificates in exchange for payment of the merger consideration. Holders of book-entry shares whose shares of\nVMware common stock were converted in the second merger into the right to receive the merger consideration will\nnot be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent to receive the merger\nconsideration. Upon surrender of VMware share certificates or book-entry shares and a duly executed letter of\ntransmittal in the case of holders of certificates to the exchange agent (or to another agent appointed by Broadcom)\nin compliance with the instructions for surrender, such holders will be entitled to receive the merger consideration\nand any fractional share cash amounts.\nBroadcom will instruct the exchange agent to accept the certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and\nconditions as the exchange agent may impose, to effect an orderly exchange in accordance with normal exchange\npractices.

After proper surrender, Broadcom will cause such holder to be paid, without interest, (i) the\namount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time of the second merger and\npaid with respect to such shares of Broadcom common stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the merger\nagreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record\ndate after the effective time of the second merger but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to\nsuch surrender payable with respect to such shares of Broadcom common stock.

From and after the effective time of the second merger, all holders of VMware share\ncertificates and book-entry shares will cease to have any rights as stockholders of VMware other than the right to\nreceive the merger consideration upon the surrender of such shares (together with the fractional share cash amount\nand any dividends or other distributions to which such shares become entitled in accordance with the merger\nagreement), without interest. From and after the effective time of the second merger, the stock transfer books of\nVMware will be closed with respect to all shares of VMware common stock outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time of the second merger. From and after the effective time of the second merger, there will be no further\nregistration of transfers on the stock transfer books of VMware and any certificates or book-entry shares formerly\nrepresenting shares of VMware common stock that are presented to Broadcom or the exchange agent for any reason\nwill be cancelled and exchanged for the merger consideration in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement\n(subject to any appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL).\nNone of the parties to the merger agreement or the exchange agent will be liable to any person with respect to any\nportion of the exchange fund or the merger consideration delivered to a public official if required by any applicable\nabandoned property, escheat or similar law. Further, any portion of the merger consideration that remains\nundistributed to holders of VMware share certificates and book-entry shares immediately prior to the date on which\nthe merger consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity will, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Broadcom, free and clear of all claims or interest of any\nperson previously entitled to such claims or interest.\nWithholding Rights\nEach party to the merger agreement, the exchange agent and any other person with a withholding obligation under\napplicable law will be entitled to deduct and withhold, from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the merger\nagreement, any amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to such payment under the Code or any\nother applicable tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate\ngovernmental entity, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to\nthe person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.\nTreatment of VMware Equity Awards\nTreatment of Stock Options\nAt the effective time of the second merger, each outstanding and in-the-money VMware stock option will become\nvested and will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each net option share\nsubject to such stock option, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and 50% of the stock consideration,\nless applicable tax withholding. For this purpose, net option shares are calculated as the number of shares of VMware\ncommon stock having a value equal to the in-the-money value of the stock option based on the value of the merger\nconsideration, with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based on the volume weighted\naverage sale price of Broadcom common stock over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the second to last\ntrading day immediately preceding the effective time of the second merger (referred to as the Broadcom trading price).\nTreatment of Restricted Stock Units\nAt the effective time of the second merger:\n\u2022\neach outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee director will become vested\nand will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each share\n101\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof VMware common stock subject to such award, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and\n50% of the stock consideration\u037e\n\u2022\neach outstanding time-based VMware restricted stock unit award that is not held by a non-employee\ndirector will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange\nratio calculated as the sum of (i) 50% of the stock consideration and (ii) 50% of the cash consideration\ndivided by the Broadcom trading price\u037e and\n\u2022\neach outstanding performance-based VMware restricted stock unit award will be converted into a\nBroadcom restricted stock unit award using the same formula described in the above bullet, provided that\n(i) for each such award granted under the VMware operating performance stock unit plan, performance\ngoals will be deemed achieved (1) at the actual level with respect to performance periods completed prior to\nthe closing of the transactions, or (2) at target level with respect to performance periods not completed\nprior to the closing of the transactions\u037e and (ii) for each such award that was granted under the VMware\nTSR performance stock unit plan, performance will be measured at the closing of the transactions based on\nthe actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals based on the value of merger\nconsideration (with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based on the\nBroadcom trading price).\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, VMware, the VMware board or the compensation committee of the\nVMware board, as applicable, will take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of VMware\u2019s employee stock\npurchase plan, as amended (referred to as the ESPP) to terminate the ESPP effective as of immediately prior to the\neffective time of the second merger, contingent upon the occurrence of the second merger, and to provide that, (i) no\noffering or purchase period will be continued or commenced under the ESPP, except for any offering or purchase\nperiod under VMware\u2019s ESPP that was in effect on the date of the merger agreement (referred to as the current ESPP\noffering period)\u037e (ii) no new participants may elect to participate in the ESPP during the current ESPP offering period\u037e\nand (iii) no participant may increase the participant\u2019s payroll deductions with respect to the current ESPP offering\nperiod.

VMware has agreed that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement with any person\nwhich directly or indirectly prohibits VMware from providing any information to Broadcom in accordance with, or\notherwise complying with, the obligations of VMware described in this paragraph.\nUnless the merger agreement has been validly terminated, VMware is obligated not to take any action to exempt any\nperson other than Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs from the restrictions on any \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d\ncontained in any applicable takeover statute or in VMware\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or otherwise cause\nsuch restrictions not to apply (other than actions consistent with actions taken in connection with the voting\nagreements prior to the approval of any transactions).\n112\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAn \u201cacquisition proposal\u201d for purposes of the merger agreement and the voting agreements means any offer,\nproposal or indication of interest from any person or group (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other\nthan a proposal or offer by Broadcom or a subsidiary of Broadcom, at any time relating to any transaction or series of\nrelated transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) involving:\n\u2022\nany acquisition or purchase by any person, directly or indirectly, of more than 20% of any class of\noutstanding VMware voting or equity securities (whether by voting power or number of shares)\u037e\n\u2022\nany tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any\nperson or group beneficially owning more than 20% of any class of outstanding VMware voting or equity\nsecurities (whether by voting power or number of shares)\u037e\n\u2022\nany merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture, recapitalization,\nreorganization or other similar transaction, in each case involving VMware and any other person or group,\npursuant to which the VMware stockholders immediately prior to such transaction hold less than 80% of\nthe equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction (whether by voting power or\neconomic interest)\u037e or\n\u2022\nany sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition to any person or group of more than 20% of the\nconsolidated assets of VMware and its subsidiaries (measured by fair market value).\nA \u201csuperior proposal\u201d for purposes of the merger agreement means a bona fide, written acquisition proposal by a\nthird party which the VMware board determines in good faith (after consultation with VMware\u2019s outside legal\ncounsel and financial advisors) to be more favorable to VMware\u2019s stockholders from a financial point of view than\nthe transactions, taking into account all relevant factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal or\noffer (including the transaction consideration, conditionality, timing, certainty of financing and/or regulatory\napprovals and likelihood of consummation) and the merger agreement (and any changes to the terms of the merger\nagreement proposed by Broadcom in response to any acquisition proposal)), although any acquisition proposal by\nthe persons executing the voting agreements (or their affiliates) will not constitute a \u201csuperior proposal.\u201d When\ndetermining whether an offer constitutes a superior proposal, references in the term \u201cacquisition proposal\u201d to \u201c20%\u201d\nor \u201c80%\u201d will be replaced with references to \u201c70%\u201d and \u201c30%,\u201d respectively.\nChange of Recommendation\u037e Match Rights\nThe merger agreement requires the VMware board to recommend that VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger\nagreement and not make a change of recommendation as described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to\nthe VMware stockholders adopting the merger agreement:\n\u2022\nthe VMware board may make certain types of a change of recommendation in response to an intervening\nevent (as defined below) if the VMware board has determined in good faith, after consultation with\nVMware\u2019s outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be\ninconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe VMware board may make a change of recommendation and cause VMware to terminate the merger\nagreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for an acquisition proposal that did not\nresult from a breach (other than a de minimis and unintentional breach) of VMware\u2019s non-solicitation\nobligations (subject to payment by VMware to Broadcom of the termination fee described under \u201c-\nTermination Fee and Expenses\u201d) which the VMware board has determined in good faith after consultation\nwith VMware\u2019s outside legal counsel and financial advisors is a superior proposal, but only if the VMware\nboard has determined in good faith after consultation with VMware\u2019s outside legal counsel, that the failure\nto take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties\nunder applicable law.\nPrior to making a change of recommendation for any reason set forth above, VMware must provide Broadcom four\nbusiness days\u2019 prior written notice advising Broadcom that it intends to make a change of recommendation. The\nnotice must specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such change of recommendation due to an intervening event\n(as defined below), or the material terms and conditions of the acquisition proposal (including a copy of any\nproposed definitive agreement) for any change of recommendation due to a superior proposal. In each case, VMware\nmust cause its representatives (including executive officers) to negotiate in good\n113\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfaith (to the extent Broadcom desires to negotiate) any proposal by Broadcom to amend the merger agreement in a\nmanner that would eliminate the need for the VMware board to make a change of recommendation, and the VMware\nboard must make all of the required determinations regarding its fiduciary duties again at the end of such four\nbusiness day negotiation period (after in good faith taking into account the amendments to the merger agreement\nproposed by Broadcom). With respect to any change of recommendation in response to a superior proposal, if there\nis any material amendment, revision or change to the terms of the then-existing superior proposal (including any\nrevision to the amount, form or mix of consideration proposed to be received by VMware\u2019s stockholders as a result of\nsuch superior proposal), VMware must again comply with the obligations described in this paragraph, except that\nreferences to the applicable four business day period will be replaced with two business days.\nAn \u201cintervening event\u201d for purposes of the merger agreement is any event, change or development first occurring or\narising after the date of the merger agreement that is material to VMware and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and\nwas not known by or reasonably foreseeable to the VMware board as of the date of the merger agreement (or if\nknown, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the VMware board as of\nthe date of the merger agreement), except that in no event will the following events, changes or developments\nconstitute an \u201cintervening event\u201d: (a) the receipt, existence or terms of an acquisition proposal or any matter relating\nthereto or consequence thereof or (b) changes in the market price or trading volume of shares of VMware common\nstock or Broadcom common stock or any other securities of VMware, Broadcom or their respective subsidiaries, or\nany change in credit rating or the fact that VMware meets or exceeds internal or published estimates, projections,\nforecasts or predictions for any period (except that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such\nchanges may be taken into account to the extent not otherwise excluded).\nNothing in the merger agreement prohibits VMware or the VMware board from (a) disclosing to VMware\u2019s\nstockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (b) making\nany \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d communication to VMware\u2019s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under\nthe Exchange Act, or any similar statement in response to any publicly disclosed acquisition proposal, (c) making any\nfactually accurate public statement that solely describes VMware\u2019s receipt of an acquisition proposal, the terms\nthereof and the identity of the person making such acquisition proposal, and the operation of the merger agreement\nwith respect thereto or (d) making any disclosure to the stockholders of VMware, if the VMware board determines in\ngood faith (after consultation with VMware\u2019s outside legal counsel) that the failure to so disclose would be\nreasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the VMware board under applicable law\u037e provided\nthat, in each case, any such disclosure also includes an express reaffirmation of the VMware\u2019s board recommendation\nthat VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.\nActions with Respect to VMware Debt\nAt the closing, VMware will deliver all notices and take other actions to facilitate the termination of all commitments\nand the repayment of all obligations outstanding under each of (i) the Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of\nSeptember 2, 2021, by and among VMware, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the lenders party thereto and (ii) the\nFive-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of September 2, 2021, by and among VMware, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the\nother borrowers party thereto and the other lenders party thereto (together, referred to as the credit facilities).\nAccess\u037e Integration Committee\u037e Strategic Transactions\nThe merger agreement provides that from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the effective time of the\nsecond merger or the date (if any) the merger agreement is validly terminated, to the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, VMware and its subsidiaries will give Broadcom and its representatives reasonable access during normal\nbusiness hours and upon reasonable advance notice to VMware\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 offices, properties, contracts,\npersonnel, books and records (so long as any such access does not unreasonably interfere with VMware\u2019s\nbusiness), and will furnish as promptly as practicable to Broadcom all information concerning VMware\u2019s business,\nproperties and personnel as Broadcom reasonably requests (including information for the purposes of transition and\nintegration planning). However, VMware is not required to provide access to or disclose information that may not be\ndisclosed pursuant to certain contractual or legal restrictions or that is subject to attorney-client, attorney work\nproduct or other legal privilege, in each case subject to certain exceptions and requirements to make substitute\narrangements.\n114\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe merger agreement provides that Broadcom and VMware will establish a transition and integration planning team,\nwhich will discuss and plan for a transition and integration planning process concerning the combination of the\noperations of Broadcom, VMware and their respective subsidiaries after the closing of the transactions, and will meet\nfrom time to time as reasonably requested by Broadcom\u2019s chief executive officer.\nThe merger agreement provides that in connection with the evaluation of strategic transactions involving any assets,\nproperties or businesses of Holdco, VMware or any subsidiary or business of the foregoing that Broadcom may\nundertake, Broadcom will be permitted to provide, with prior notice to VMware, information about such assets,\nproperties or businesses to potential counterparties thereof (and their representatives) so long as (i) such potential\ncounterparties are subject to a customary nondisclosure agreement with Broadcom (to which VMware is an express\nthird party beneficiary) and (ii) promptly following the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its\nterms, Broadcom shall request in writing that each such potential counterparty promptly destroy or return to VMware\nall non-public information of VMware furnished pursuant to such nondisclosure agreement.\nFinancing Cooperation\nUnder the merger agreement, prior to the effective time of the second merger, VMware and its subsidiaries will, and\nwill use their reasonable best efforts to cause their representatives to, provide all customary cooperation and all\ncustomary financial information, in each case, that is reasonably requested by Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs\nin connection with any financing obtained by Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs for the purpose of financing the\ntransactions or any transaction undertaken in connection therewith, subject to certain limitations set forth in the\nmerger agreement.\nIn addition, the merger agreement provides that VMware will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and\ntake all other actions reasonably requested by Broadcom that are required to facilitate in accordance with the terms\nthereof the termination of all commitments outstanding under VMware\u2019s credit facilities, the repayment in full of all\nobligations, if any, outstanding thereunder, the release of all liens, if any, securing such obligations, and the release\nof guarantees in connection therewith on the closing date as of the effective time of the second merger, subject to\ncertain limitations set forth in the merger agreement.

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, (i) Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into VMware, with\nVMware surviving the first merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco, (ii) following the effective\ntime of the first merger, VMware, the surviving company of the first merger, will be converted into a Delaware limited\nliability company, (iii) following the effective time of the LLC conversion, Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into\nHoldco, with Holdco surviving the second merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom, and (iv)\nfollowing the effective time of the second merger, Holdco, the surviving company of the second merger, will merge\nwith and into Merger Sub 3, with Merger Sub 3 surviving the third merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of\nBroadcom. See the section titled \u201cThe Transactions\u201d for additional information on the effects of the transactions\nmentioned here.\nAs a result of the transactions, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time of the second merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of each holder\nof such share of VMware common stock, and subject to proration in accordance with the merger agreement, either:\n(a)\n$142.50 per share in cash, without interest, or\n(b)\n0.25200 shares of Broadcom common stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nThe shareholder election will be subject to a proration mechanism, such that the total number of shares of VMware\ncommon stock entitled to receive the cash consideration, and the total number of shares of VMware common stock\nentitled to receive the stock consideration, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of\nVMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger. See the\nsection titled \u201cThe Transactions - Merger Consideration\u201d for additional information regarding the merger\nconsideration.\nThe transactions will be treated as a business combination for accounting purposes. Broadcom is determined to be\nthe accounting acquirer after taking into account the relative share ownership, the composition of the governing\nbody of the combined entity, and the designation of certain senior management positions. The purchase price of the\ntransactions will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their preliminary fair values at\nthe closing date.\nFinancing\nIn connection with the merger agreement, Broadcom entered into a debt commitment letter with certain financial\ninstitutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, a senior unsecured\nbridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32.0 billion. See the section titled \u201cThe Transactions - Financing\nof the Transactions\u201d for additional information regarding the anticipated financing of the transactions.\nBroadcom plans to fund the cash portion of the transactions through a combination of (i) cash on hand and (ii) new\ndebt financing. Broadcom intends to borrow $32.0 billion for the transactions. Broadcom expects to replace the\ncommitments in respect of the bridge facility prior to the consummation of the transactions with the proceeds from\nthe issuance of one or more series of senior unsecured debt securities and/or other incurrences of indebtedness.\nSince terms of the senior unsecured debt securities and/or other indebtedness are currently unavailable, the\nunaudited pro forma

condensed combined financial information is prepared in accordance with Article 11 of\nRegulation S-X as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 \u201cAmendments to Financial Disclosures about\nAcquired and Disposed Businesses\u201d. The historical information of Broadcom and VMware is presented in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of July 31, 2022 is prepared using the historical\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets of Broadcom and VMware as of July 31, 2022 and July 29, 2022,\nrespectively, giving effect to (i) the transactions as if they had been completed on July 31, 2022 and (ii) the\nassumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended July 31, 2022 and\nthe year ended October 31, 2021 give effect to (i) the transactions as if they had been completed on November 2,\n2020, the beginning of Broadcom\u2019s most recently completed fiscal year and (ii) the assumptions and adjustments\ndescribed in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended July 31, 2022 is\nprepared using Broadcom\u2019s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended\nJuly 31, 2022 and VMware\u2019s unaudited condensed combined statement of income for the nine months ended July 29,\n2022, which is derived by adding the audited consolidated statement of income for the year ended January 28, 2022\nand unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the six months ended July 29, 2022 and subtracting\nthe unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended October 29, 2021. As the\ndifference between Broadcom\u2019s and VMware\u2019s fiscal year-end dates is less than one fiscal quarter, the unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 is prepared using\nBroadcom\u2019s historical audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 and\nVMware\u2019s historical audited consolidated statement of income for the year ended January 28, 2022, as permitted\nunder Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X. However, given the different fiscal year ends, VMware\u2019s historical unaudited\ncondensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended January 28, 2022 is included in both the\nfiscal year ended October 31, 2021 and the nine months ended July 31, 2022 unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined statements of operations. VMware reported revenue of $3.5 billion and net income of $586 million for the\nthree months ended January 28, 2022.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared using the acquisition method of\naccounting in accordance with the business combination accounting guidance as provided in Accounting Standards\nCodification 805, Business Combinations, with Broadcom treated as the accounting acquirer for the transactions. As\na result of the proration mechanism described in the introduction section, the unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined financial information is prepared based on the expectation that 50% of VMware\u2019s common stock are cash\nelection shares and the remaining 50% of VMware\u2019s common stock are stock election shares.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is provided for informational purposes only and\nis not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred if the transactions had been completed\nas of the dates set forth above, nor is it indicative of the future results of Broadcom following the transactions. In\ndetermining the preliminary estimate of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of VMware, Broadcom\nused publicly available benchmarking information as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market\nparticipant assumptions. The purchase price allocation relating to the transactions is preliminary and subject to\nchange, as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. There can be no\nassurances that the final valuations will not result in material changes to this preliminary purchase price allocation.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to the potential impact of\nany anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the transactions or of any\nintegration costs. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not purport to project the\nfuture operating results or financial position of Broadcom following the transactions.\n132\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with:\n\u2022\nthe accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\u037e\n\u2022\nthe separate historical audited consolidated financial statements of Broadcom as of and for the year ended\nOctober 31, 2021, included in Broadcom\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 17,\n2021 and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus\u037e\n\u2022\nthe separate historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Broadcom as of and for\nthe nine months ended July 31, 2022, included in Broadcom\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the\nSEC on September 8, 2022 and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus\u037e\n\u2022\nthe separate historical audited consolidated financial statements of VMware as of and for the year ended\nJanuary 28, 2022, included in VMware\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 24, 2022\nand incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus\u037e\n\u2022\nthe separate historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of VMware as of and for the\nsix months ended July 29, 2022, included in VMware\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on\nSeptember 2, 2022 and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe separate historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of VMware as of and for the\nnine months ended October 29, 2021, included in VMware\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the\nSEC on December 3, 2021 and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.\n2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u202f\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial\ninformation are those set out in Broadcom\u2019s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended October 31,\n2021. Upon consummation of the transactions, management will perform a comprehensive review of the accounting\npolicies between the two entities. Management is currently not aware of any significant accounting policy\ndifferences and has therefore not made any adjustments to the pro forma condensed combined financial information\nrelated to any potential differences. Upon completion of management\u2019s review, management may identify differences\nin accounting policies between the two entities which, when conformed, could have a material impact on the financial\nstatements of Broadcom following the transactions.\nCertain reclassifications are reflected in the pro forma adjustments to conform VMware\u2019s presentation to Broadcom\u2019s\nin the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of operations. These reclassifications\nhave no effect on previously reported total assets, total liabilities and shareholders\u2019 equity, or net income of\nBroadcom or VMware. The pro forma financial information may not reflect all reclassifications necessary to conform\nVMware\u2019s presentation to that of Broadcom due to limitations on the availability of information as of the date of this\nproxy statement/prospectus. Accounting policy differences and additional reclassification adjustments may be\nidentified as more information becomes available.\nThe following reclassification adjustments were made to conform VMware\u2019s presentation to Broadcom\u2019s\npresentation:\n(a)\nRepresents the reclassification of deferred tax assets to other long-term assets.\n(b)\nRepresents the reclassification of unearned revenue to other current liabilities, offset by reclassifications of\n$1.1 billion of employee related liabilities from other current liabilities to employee compensation and\nbenefits, and the reclassification of $6 million of current finance lease liabilities from other current liabilities\nto current portion of long-term debt.\n(c)\nRepresents the reclassification of unearned revenue - non-current, income tax payable, and operating lease\nliabilities to other long-term liabilities offset by the reclassification of $37 million of long-term finance lease\nliabilities from other long-term liabilities to long-term debt.\n(d)\nRepresents the reclassification of license revenue, subscription and SaaS revenue, and services revenue to\nsubscriptions and services revenue.\n(e)\nRepresents the reclassification of cost of license revenue, cost of subscription and SaaS revenue and cost\nof services revenue to cost of subscriptions and services revenue (referred to as CoSS).\n133\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(f)\nRepresents the reclassification of sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense to\nselling, general and administrative expense (referred to as SG&A).\n(g)\nRepresents the reclassification of investment income to other income (expense), net.\u202f\n(h)\nRepresents the reclassification of realignment expense to restructuring, impairment and disposal charges.\n3.\nCalculation of Merger Consideration and Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation of the Transactions\nThe estimated preliminary merger consideration of $60,565 million is calculated based on the expectation that 50% of\nVMware common stock are cash election shares and the remaining 50% of VMware common stock are stock election\nshares due to the proration mechanism. The fair value of the merger consideration expected to be transferred on the\nclosing date includes the value of the estimated cash consideration\u037e the estimated fair value of approximately 54\nmillion shares of Broadcom common stock to be transferred, calculated by using the price per share of Broadcom\ncommon stock as of September 9, 2022\u037e the estimated fair value of assumed VMware equity awards attributable to\npre-combination services\u037e and the estimated amount of cash to be paid for the repayment of VMware\u2019s outstanding\ndebt. The calculation of the merger consideration is as follows:\nConsideration Transferred\n(dollars in\nmillions)\nEstimated cash consideration(1)\n$30,265\nEstimated fair value of Broadcom common stock to be issued(2)\n27,960\nEstimated fair value of assumed VMware equity awards attributable to pre-combination\nservices(3)\n340\nservices(3)\n340\nEstimated repayment of VMware's outstanding debt(4)\n2,000\nTotal estimated merger consideration\n$60,565\nTotal cash consideration\n32,265\nTotal equity consideration\n28,300\nTotal estimated merger consideration\n$60,565\n(1)\nRepresents the estimated cash consideration to be paid, consisting of (i) approximately $30,243 million for the cash election\nshares and (ii) approximately $22 million to settle all outstanding VMware stock options and VMware restricted stock unit awards\nheld by non-employee members of VMware board of directors (referred to as director RSUs). The cash to be paid to settle\nVMware stock options and director RSUs included in the merger consideration represents the amount attributable to pre-\ncombination services. The amount of cash consideration to be paid for the cash election shares is estimated based on $142.50 per\nshare of VMware common stock. The cash settlement amount to be paid for director RSUs is calculated based on $71.25 per each\nshare of VMware common stock underlying such award and the cash settlement amount to be paid for VMware stock options is\ncalculated based on $71.25 per each net option share (net option shares are calculated as the number of shares of VMware\ncommon stock having a value equal to the in-the-money value of the VMware stock option based on the value of the merger\nconsideration). The calculation of preliminary merger consideration is based on 424,467,467 shares of VMware common stock\noutstanding as of September 9, 2022.\n(2)\nRepresents the estimated fair value of approximately 54 million shares of Broadcom common stock estimated to be issued,\ncalculated using the per share price of Broadcom common stock as of September 9, 2022. The fair value of Broadcom common\nstock to be issued consists of (i) approximately $27,939 million for the stock election shares and (ii) approximately $21 million\nfor the settlement of VMware stock options and director RSUs. The fair value of Broadcom common stock to be issued to settle\nVMware stock options and director RSUs included in the merger consideration represents the amount attributable to pre-\ncombination services. As outlined in the merger agreement, each stock election share to be settled at closing will be exchanged\nfor 0.25200 shares of Broadcom common stock and each net option share and director RSU to be settled at closing will be\nexchanged for 0.12600 shares of Broadcom common stock. The calculation of preliminary merger consideration is based on\n424,467,467 shares of VMware common stock outstanding as of September 9, 2022.\n(3)\nRepresents the estimated fair value of VMware restricted stock unit awards (other than director RSUs) and performance stock\nunit awards attributable to pre-combination services. As outlined in the merger agreement, each outstanding VMware restricted\nstock unit award (other than director RSUs) and each outstanding VMware performance stock unit award will be assumed by\nBroadcom and converted into a number of restricted stock units denominated in shares of Broadcom common stock. Broadcom\nestimates that approximately 7 million Broadcom restricted stock unit awards with an estimated fair value of $3,506 million will\nbe issued in connection with the transactions, and $340 million is attributable to pre-combination services.\n(4)\nRepresents estimated pay-off amount for the repayment of VMware\u2019s senior unsecured term loan facility.\n134\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe actual value of Broadcom common stock to be issued will depend on the per share price of Broadcom common\nstock at the closing date of the transactions, and therefore, the actual merger consideration will fluctuate with the\nmarket price of Broadcom common stock until the transactions are consummated. The following table shows the\neffect of changes in Broadcom\u2019s stock price and the resulting impact on the estimated merger consideration and\nestimated goodwill:\u202f\nChange in Stock Price\nStock\nPrice\nEstimated\nMerger\nConsideration\nEstimated\nGoodwill\n(dollars in millions, except stock price)\nIncrease of 10%\n$574.64\n$63,395\n$50,373\nDecrease of 10%\n$470.16\n$57,735\n$44,713\nPreliminary Purchase Price Allocation\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, VMware\u2019s identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by\nBroadcom will be recorded at the acquisition date fair values and added to those of Broadcom. The pro forma\nadjustments are preliminary and based on estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed and are prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the transactions. The final determination of\nthe purchase price allocation will be completed as soon as practicable after the completion of the transactions and\nwill be based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the closing date. The final\namounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed could differ significantly from the amounts presented in\nthe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price\nallocation is subject to further adjustment as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses and\nfinal valuations are completed. There can be no assurances that these additional analyses and final valuations will\nnot result in material changes to the estimates of fair value set forth below.\nThe following table sets forth a preliminary allocation of the estimated merger consideration to VMware\u2019s identifiable\ntangible and intangible assets expected to be acquired and liabilities expected to be assumed by Broadcom, as if the\ntransactions had been completed on July 31, 2022, based on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of\nVMware as of July 29, 2022, with the excess recorded as goodwill:\n(dollars in\nmillions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\u200b3,122\nTrade accounts receivable, net\n3,340\nOther current assets\n605\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n1,734\nIntangible assets, net\n30,000\nOther long-term assets\n1,385\nTotal assets\n40,186\nAccounts payable\n(294)\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n(1,105)\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n(6)\nOther current liabilities\n(8,084)\nLong-term debt\n(8,419)\nOther long-term liabilities\n(9,256)\nTotal liabilities\n(27,164)\nNet assets acquired (a)\n13,022\nEstimated purchase consideration (b)\n60,565\nEstimated goodwill (b) - (a)\n$47,543\nGoodwill represents the excess of the preliminary estimated merger consideration over the estimated fair value of the\nunderlying net assets acquired. Goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be reviewed for impairment at least\nannually, absent any indicators of impairment. Goodwill is attributable to planned growth in new markets, and\nsynergies expected to be achieved from the combined operations of Broadcom and VMware. Goodwill recognized in\nthe transactions is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n135\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n4.\nTransaction Accounting Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet\n(a)\nRepresents the total merger consideration of $60,565 million, consisting of (i) cash consideration of $30,243\nmillion for cash election shares, (ii) cash consideration of $22 million for the pre-combination portion of\nVMware stock options and director RSUs, (iii) repayment of the outstanding principal balance of $2,000\nmillion under VMware\u2019s senior unsecured term loan facility by Broadcom, (iv) issuance of approximately 54\nmillion shares of Broadcom common stock with an estimated fair value of $27,960 million, and (v) issuance\nof approximately 7 million Broadcom restricted stock unit awards with an estimated fair value of $340 million\nattributable to pre-combination services.

Preliminary\nproperty, plant and equipment fair values, and the revised value of the ROU assets related to finance\nleases, in the pro forma financial information are provided in the table below. The depreciation expense\nrelated to these assets, except the ROU assets related to finance leases, is reflected as a pro forma\nadjustment in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, as further described\nin Note 5(b). The net adjustment to the ROU assets related to operating leases is reflected in other long-\nterm assets. VMware's acquired ROU assets and lease liabilities are measured and recognized based on\nremaining future lease payments using Broadcom\u2019s incremental borrowing rates.

Because VMware\u2019s outstanding stock options and director RSUs will be settled at closing\nand require no further service, the entire post-combination portion of such awards is recognized as\ncompensation expense immediately after the closing of the transactions.\n(o)\nRepresents the adjustment to the deferred tax asset and the deferred tax liability balances associated with\nthe incremental differences in the book and tax basis created from the preliminary purchase price allocation,\nprimarily resulting from the preliminary fair value of intangible assets. The total adjustment of $8.5 billion is\nreflected as the netting of the historical VMware deferred tax asset balance of $6.0 billion against the\ndeferred tax liability, and an additional $2.5 billion adjustment made to the deferred tax liability. In addition,\n$426 million of Broadcom\u2019s historical deferred tax asset balance is reclassified to the deferred tax liability to\nappropriately reflect the net deferred tax liability balance of Broadcom after the transactions. Deferred taxes\nare established based on a blended statutory tax rate based on jurisdictions where income is generated.\nThe effective tax rate of Broadcom following the transactions could be significantly different (either higher\nor lower) depending on post-acquisition activities, including the geographical mix of income. This\ndetermination is preliminary and subject to change based upon the final determination of the closing date\nfair value, primarily of the identifiable intangible assets.\n5.\nTransaction Accounting Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations\n(a)\nRepresents the adjustment to record elimination of historical amortization expense and recognition of new\namortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets based on the estimated fair value as of July 31,\n2022. Amortization expense is calculated based on the estimated fair value of each of the identifiable\nintangible assets and the associated estimated useful lives as discussed in Note 4(i) above, and is allocated\nbetween amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets - cost of revenue (referred to as ACoR) and\namortization of acquisition-related intangible assets - operating expenses (referred to as AOE) based on the\nnature of activities associated with the intangible assets acquired.\nThe adjustment for the amortization expense is as follows:\u202f\nFor the Nine Months Ended July 31, 2022\nFor the Year Ended October 31, 2021\nCoSS\nR&D\nSG&A\nACoR\nAOE\nCoSS\nR&D\nSG&A\nACoR\nAOE\n(dollars in millions)\nReversal of VMware\u2019s\nhistorical amortization\nexpense\n$(145)\n$(8)\n$(51)\n$-\n$-\n$(210)\n$(8)\n$(85)\n$-\n$-\nAmortization of purchased\nidentifiable intangible\nassets\n-\n-\n-\n2,273\n925\n-\n-\n-\n3,031\n1,233\nTotal intangible asset\namortization adjustment\n$(145) $(8)\n$(51) $2,273 $925 $(210) $(8)\n$(85) $3,031 $1,233\nIn addition, the periods the amortization impacts will ultimately be based on the periods in which the\nassociated economic benefits are expected to be derived. Therefore, the amount of amortization following\nthe transactions may differ significantly between periods based upon the final value assigned and\namortization methodology used for each identifiable intangible asset.\n138\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(b)\nRepresents the adjustment to record elimination of historical depreciation expense and recognition of new\ndepreciation expense based on the estimated fair value as of July 31, 2022. The depreciation of property,\nplant and equipment is calculated based on the estimated fair value of each asset and the associated\nremaining useful lives as discussed in Note 4(f) above. Depreciation expense is allocated among CoSS,\nresearch and development (referred to as R&D), and SG&A based upon the nature of activities associated\nwith the use of the property, plant and equipment.\nThe adjustment for the depreciation expense is as follows:\u202f\nFor the Nine Months Ended July 31, 2022\nFor the Year Ended October 31, 2021\nCoSS\nR&D\nSG&A\nCoSS\nR&D\nSG&A\n(dollars in millions)\nReversal of VMware\u2019s\nhistorical depreciation\nexpense\n$(48)\n$(64)\n$(111)\n$(51)\n$(79)\n$(146)\nDepreciation of acquired\nproperty, plant and\nequipment\n42\n57\n98\n109\n145\n251\nTotal depreciation expense\nadjustment\n$(6)\n$(7)\n$(13)\n$58\n$66\n$105\n(c)\nRepresents the adjustment to record the elimination of historical VMware stock-based compensation\nexpense and recognition of new stock-based compensation expense for the post-combination portion of\nVMware\u2019s stock options, restricted stock unit awards and performance stock unit awards. As discussed in\nadjustment 4(n) above, because VMware\u2019s outstanding stock options and director RSUs will be settled and\nrequire no further service, the entire post-combination portion of such awards is recognized as a\ncompensation expense immediately after the closing of the transactions. This is a non-recurring adjustment.\nThe income tax benefit resulting from this adjustment is $0.5 million using Broadcom\u2019s statutory tax rate of\n18%.\nVMware\u2019s performance stock unit awards and restricted stock unit awards (other than director RSUs) are\nassumed and converted into approximately 7 million Broadcom restricted stock unit awards with an\nestimated fair value of $3,506 million, of which $3,166 million is attributable to post-combination services\nand will be recognized as compensation expense. Broadcom restricted stock unit awards will be subject to\nthe same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding VMware equity awards, including vesting\nterms. Therefore, the post-combination portion of Broadcom restricted stock unit awards will be recognized\nas stock-based compensation expense ratably over the remaining vesting period. With respect to any\nBroadcom restricted stock unit award that replaces a VMware performance stock unit award, vesting will no\nlonger be subject to the achievement of performance goals or metrics and will solely be based on providing\ncontinued services to Broadcom and its affiliates, including VMware, through the end of the applicable\nperformance period.\nThe following table reflects the elimination of VMware\u2019s historical stock-based compensation expense and\nthe recognition of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of Broadcom restricted stock\nunit awards. Stock-based compensation expense is allocated among CoSS, R&D and SG&A based upon\nthe nature of activities associated.\n139\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe adjustment for the stock-based compensation expense is as follows:\nFor the Nine Months Ended July 31,\n2022\nFor the Year Ended October 31,\n2021\nCoSS\nR&D\nSG&A\nCoSS\nR&D\nSG&A\n(dollars in millions)\nReversal of VMware\u2019s\nhistorical stock-based\ncompensation expense\n$(87)\n$(404)\n$(364)\n$(114)\n$(528)\n$(433)\nPost-combination stock-based\ncompensation expense\n81\n377\n339\n134\n619\n558\nTotal stock-based\ncompensation expense\nadjustment\n$(6)\n$(27)\n$(25)\n$20\n$91\n$125\n(d)\nRepresents the reversal of historical deferred commission amortization expense related to the elimination in\nNote 4(e) above.\n(e)\nRepresents the reversal of VMware\u2019s historical interest expense, including the amortization of debt\nissuance costs. In addition, this adjustment reflects the addition of the estimated interest expense based on\nthe estimated fair value of VMware debt assumed by Broadcom.\nFor the Nine\nMonths \nEnded July 31,\n2022\nFor the Year\nEnded \nOctober 31, 2021\n(dollars in millions)\nReversal of VMware\u2019s historical interest expense and\namortization of debt issuance costs\n$(224)\n$(252)\nInterest expense with the fair value of VMware debt\nassumed by Broadcom\n277\n209\nTotal interest expense adjustment\n$53\n$(43)\n(f)\nRepresents the income tax benefit resulting from the aggregate increase in expenses due to the transaction\naccounting adjustments described herein. As a result of the corresponding decrease in income before\nincome taxes in the statements of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 and the nine months\nended July 31, 2022, an income tax benefit is recognized for each period respectively. A blended statutory\ntax rate of approximately 12% is assumed for the amortization of intangible assets, and a blended statutory\ntax rate of approximately 18% is assumed for all other pro forma adjustments. The applicable blended\nstatutory tax rates are based on the jurisdictions in which the assets are located and are not necessarily\nindicative of the effective tax rate of Broadcom following the transactions, which could be significantly\ndifferent depending on post-acquisition activities, including the geographical mix of income.\n(g)\nRepresents the elimination of revenue recognized by VMware and selling, general and administrative\nexpenses recognized by Broadcom from the pre-existing relationship between the two entities.\n(h)\nReflects the total estimated transaction costs for Broadcom and VMware that have not yet been recognized\nin the statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021. Transaction costs are expensed as\nincurred and reflected as if incurred on November 2, 2020, the date the transactions are assumed to have\nbeen completed for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of\noperations. This is a non-recurring item. The income tax benefit resulting from this adjustment is $76 million\nusing Broadcom\u2019s statutory tax rate of 18%.\n(i)\nRepresents the pro forma basic net income per share attributable to common stock calculated using the\nhistorical basic weighted average shares of Broadcom common stock outstanding, adjusted for additional\nshares to be issued to holders of VMware common stock and holders of VMware equity awards to\nconsummate the transactions.

As noted in the Financing section above, Broadcom expects to issue one or\nmore series of senior unsecured debt securities and/or other incurrences of indebtedness prior to closing of\nthe transactions. Therefore, the bridge facility is not expected to be utilized. However, as the terms of the\nbridge facility are the best available information, the financing adjustments are calculated based on the\nterms of the bridge facility. The new debt is classified as current debt based on the bridge facility\u2019s term of\n364 days.\u202f\n(b)\nTo record estimated interest expense, including the amortization of capitalized costs, related to the\nadjustment in Note 6(a) above. The bridge facility is assumed to be outstanding for the entire year ended\nOctober 31, 2021 and the nine months ended July 31, 2022. The interest rate assumed for purposes of\npreparing this pro forma financial information is 4.004%, which represents the 1-month Term SOFR\nreference rate published by the CME term SOFR administrator as of September 9, 2022, plus 1.225%. In\naddition to the interest expense, the adjustments also include adjustments to additional fees.\n141\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA sensitivity analysis on interest expense for the nine months ended July 31, 2022 and the year ended\nOctober 31, 2021 has been performed to assess the effect of a change of 12.5 basis points of the\nhypothetical interest rate would have on the interest expense.

The differences between the rights of VMware\nstockholders and Broadcom stockholders primarily result from differences between their respective organizational\ndocuments. As a result, if the transactions are completed, the rights of VMware stockholders who become Broadcom\nstockholders will continue to be governed by the DGCL and will also then be governed by Broadcom\u2019s amended\nand restated certificate of incorporation (referred to as the Broadcom charter) and amended and restated bylaws\n(referred to as the Broadcom bylaws).\nThe following description summarizes the material differences between the rights of Broadcom stockholders and\nVMware stockholders but does not purport to be a complete statement of all those differences, or a complete\ndescription of the specific provisions referred to in this summary.

        "APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF VMWARE STOCKHOLDERS": {
            "text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF VMWARE STOCKHOLDERS\nGeneral. Holders of VMware common stock will become holders of Holdco common stock as a result of the first\nmerger. Holders of VMware common stock will not have appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL in connection\nwith the first merger. The holders of Holdco common stock will be entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the\nDGCL in connection with the second merger.\nIf you hold one or more shares of VMware common stock, you are entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law and\nhave the right to have your shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive the \u201cfair value\u201d of such\nshares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) as of\ncompletion of the second merger in place of the merger consideration, as determined by the court, if you strictly\ncomply with the procedures specified in Section 262 of the DGCL. Any such VMware stockholder awarded \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d for its, his or her shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value in cash, together with interest, if\nany, in lieu of the right to receive the merger consideration.\nThe following discussion is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is\nqualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus\nas Annex F. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder\nof the shares of VMware common stock. The following discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor\ndoes it constitute a recommendation that you exercise your rights to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, when a merger is submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders as in the case\nof approval of the merger agreement proposal, VMware, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each\nstockholder who was a VMware stockholder on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for\nwhich appraisal rights are available, that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262\nof the DGCL. This proxy statement/prospectus constitutes the required notice, and the copy of Section 262 of the\nDGCL is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex F. A holder of VMware common stock who wishes to\nexercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve the right to do so should review the following discussion and\nAnnex F carefully and consult with legal advisors. Failure to strictly comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the\nDGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who\nloses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration.\nHow to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights. VMware stockholders wishing to exercise the rights to seek an\nappraisal of their shares must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nyou must not vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement proposal. Because a proxy that is signed\nand submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of\napproval of the merger agreement proposal, if you submit a proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal\nrights, you must instruct the proxy to vote your shares against approval of the merger agreement proposal\nor abstain from voting your shares on the approval of the merger agreement proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nyou must deliver to VMware a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the approval of the merger\nagreement proposal at the special meeting and be a stockholder of record at the time of the making of such\ndemand\u037e\n\u2022\nyou must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of\nthe second merger\u037e and\n\u2022\nyou or the surviving company in the third merger (or any other stockholder that has properly demanded\nappraisal rights and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights) must file a petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective time\nof the second merger. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition in the\nDelaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the\nVMware stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of\nVMware common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\n160TABLE OF CONTENTS\nVoting, virtually or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the approval of the merger\nagreement proposal will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The\nwritten demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote.\nWho May Exercise Appraisal Rights. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of\nrecord. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder\u2019s name as it appears on the stock\ncertificates (or in the stock ledger). The demand must reasonably inform VMware of the identity of the stockholder\nand that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its common stock. Non-record owners may not\ndirectly make appraisal demands to VMware. The non-record owner must, in such cases, have the owner of record,\nsuch as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of\ncommon stock. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds shares of VMware\ncommon stock as a nominee for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of VMware common\nstock held for one or more non-record owners, while not exercising this right for other non-record owners. In that\ncase, the written demand should state the number of shares of VMware common stock as to which appraisal is\nsought. Where no number of shares of VMware common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed\nto cover all shares of VMware common stock held in the name of the record owner.\nIF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND\nYOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE\nFIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE\nBANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE\nSHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER\nPERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO\nCAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS\nNECESSARY TO PERFECT YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nIf you own shares of VMware common stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy\nin common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent,\nincluding an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record\u037e\nhowever, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in making the demand, such\nperson is acting as agent for the record owner. If you hold shares of VMware common stock through a broker who in\nturn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of\nsuch shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as\nrecord holder.\nIf you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand,\nexecuted as set forth above, to:\nVMWARE, INC. \n3401 Hillview Ave\nPalo Alto, California 94304\n(650) 427-5000\nAttention: Office of the Secretary\nActions After Completion of the second merger. If the second merger is consummated, the surviving company in the\nthird merger will give written notice that the second merger has become effective within 10 days after the effective\ntime of the second merger to each stockholder that did not vote in favor of the merger agreement and delivered a\nwritten demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the\neffective time of the second merger, any stockholder that did not commence an appraisal proceeding or join in such a\nproceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such demand and to accept the merger consideration in\naccordance with the merger agreement for his, her or its shares of common stock. Within 120 days after the effective\ntime of the second merger, but not later, any stockholder that has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL, or the surviving company in the third merger may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving company in the third merger in the case of a\npetition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the value of the shares of VMware common stock held\nby all such stockholders. The surviving company in the third merger is under no obligation to file an appraisal\npetition and has no intention of doing so.\n161\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf you desire to have your shares appraised and have otherwise complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the\nDGCL, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time periods\nand in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the second merger, any stockholder that has complied with the provisions\nof Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the surviving company in the third merger, upon written\nrequest, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the approval of the merger\nagreement proposal and with respect to which VMware has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of holders of those shares. The surviving company in the third merger must mail this statement within the\nlater of 10 days of receipt by the surviving company in the third merger of the request therefor or 10 days after\nexpiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the non-record owner of shares of stock held\nin a voting trust or by a nominee on your behalf, you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from\nthe surviving company in the third merger the statement described in this paragraph.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving company in the third\nmerger, the surviving company in the third merger will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a\ncopy of the petition, to provide the Delaware Register in Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and\naddresses of all holders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then\ndetermine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders demanding appraisal\nwho hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the\npendency of the appraisal proceedings and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any\nstockholder who fails to comply with this direction. Where proceedings are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal\nis not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of VMware common stock\nowned by such stockholders in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules\nspecifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value\nof the shares of VMware common stock at the effective time of the second merger held by all stockholders who have\nproperly perfected appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation\nof the second merger. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause\nshown, interest from the effective time of the second merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be\ncompounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during the period between the effective time of the second merger and the date of\npayment of the judgment. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of\nsuch value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same, upon surrender by such\nstockholders of their stock certificates or, in the case of book-entry shares, forthwith.\nIn determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining\nfair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally\nconsidered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered and that\n\u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware\nSupreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset\nvalue, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained\nas of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the\nDGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such\nexclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only\nto the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware\nSupreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,\nmay be considered.\u201d An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under\nSection 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater\nthan, the same as, or less than the value of the merger consideration. Broadcom and the surviving company in the\nthird merger do\n162\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnot anticipate offering more than the merger consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserve\nthe right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of\nVMware common stock is less than the merger consideration.\nIf no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective time of the second merger, then all\nstockholders will lose the right to an appraisal, and will instead receive the merger consideration described in the\nmerger agreement, without interest thereon.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may tax those costs\nagainst the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems to be equitable under the circumstances. However,\ncosts do not include attorneys and expert witness fees. Each stockholder is responsible for its own attorneys and\nexpert witnesses expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order\nall or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares\nentitled to appraisal.\nAny stockholder that has duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the\neffective time of the second merger, be entitled to vote the VMware shares subject to that demand for any purpose or\nreceive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to\nholders of record of VMware shares as of a record date prior to the effective time of the second merger.\nAny stockholder that has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party may\nwithdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the\ndemand for appraisal to the surviving corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after\nthe effective time of the second merger will require written approval of the surviving company in the third merger. No\nappraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval\nof the Delaware Court of Chancery and such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems just, provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the second merger within 60 days after the effective time of\nthe second merger. If you fail to perfect, successfully withdraw or lose the appraisal right, your shares will be\nconverted into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest thereon.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of\nappraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration for your shares in accordance\nwith the merger agreement. In view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a\nVMware stockholder and are considering exercising your appraisal rights under the DGCL, you should consult your\nown legal advisor.\nTHE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE\nWITH TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD\nCONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION\n262 OF THE DGCL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FOREGOING\nSUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.\n163\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLEGAL MATTERS",

The Company agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any\nagreement with any Person which directly or indirectly prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in

Company\u2019s outside legal\ncounsel that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under\napplicable Law or (ii) make a Change of Recommendation and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance\nwith Section 9.1(g) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach\n(other than a de minimis and unintentional breach) of Section 6.3(b)), which the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after\nconsultation with the Company\u2019s outside legal counsel and financial advisors is a Superior Proposal, but only if the Company Board of\nDirectors has determined in good faith after consultation with the Company\u2019s outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would\nreasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law\u037e provided that, notwithstanding anything\nto the contrary herein, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless this\nAgreement has been validly terminated in accordance with Section 9.1(g). \u201cIntervening Event\u201d means any event, change or development first\noccurring or arising after the date hereof that is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and was not\nknown by or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board of Directors as of the date hereof (or if known, the material consequences of\nwhich were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board of Directors as of the date of this Agreement)\u037e provided, however,\nthat in no event shall the

Parent desires to negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a\nmanner that would obviate the need to effect a Change of Recommendation and at the end of such four business day period the Company\nBoard of Directors again makes all of the required determinations under Section 6.3(e)(i) (after in good faith taking into account any\namendments proposed by Parent) or (ii) under Section 6.3(e)(ii), the Company shall provide Parent with four business days\u2019 prior written\nnotice advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the material terms and conditions of\nthe Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of any proposed definitive documentation, and during such four business day period,

conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer\nconstitute a Superior Proposal and at the end of such four business day period the Company Board of Directors again makes all of the\nrequired determinations under Section 6.3(e)(ii) (after in good faith taking into account the amendments proposed by Parent). With respect to\nSection 6.3(f)(ii), if there are any material amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any\nrevision to the amount, form or mix of consideration the Company Stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal), the\nCompany shall comply again with Section 6.3(f)(ii) with references to the applicable four business day period being replaced by two\nbusiness days.\n(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Company\nStockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any \u201cstop, look and\nlisten\u201d communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or any similar\nstatement in response to any publicly disclosed Acquisition Proposal, (iii) making any factually accurate public statement that solely\ndescribes the Company\u2019s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the terms thereof and the identity of the person making such Acquisition\nProposal, and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto or (iv) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company, if the\nCompany Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company\u2019s outside legal counsel) that the failure to so\ndisclose would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law\u037e\nprovided that, in each case, any such disclosure also includes an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation. For the\navoidance of doubt, this Section 6.3(g) shall not permit the Company Board of Directors to make (or otherwise modify the definition of) a\nChange of Recommendation except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.3(e) and Section 6.3(f).",
