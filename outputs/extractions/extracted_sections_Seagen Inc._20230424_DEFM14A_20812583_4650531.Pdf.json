A copy of the voting agreement is\nattached as Annex B to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the entire voting agreement carefully because it is the principal document\ngoverning the terms of the voting commitment from Baker Bros.\nThe Merger Consideration (see page 32) \nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of our common stock issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares of our common stock to be canceled or converted in accordance with the terms\nand subject to the conditions set forth in\n \n-4- \nTable of Contents\nthe merger agreement and any shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by a holder who has\ncomplied with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as amended, and all rules and regulations promulgated\nthereunder, the \u201cDGCL\u201d) with respect to such shares of our common stock, the \u201cdissenting shares\u201d) will be converted into the right to receive an\namount in cash equal to $229.00 (the \u201cmerger consideration\u201d), without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nRecommendation of the Board of Directors\u037e Reasons for the Merger (see pages 24 and 45) \nAfter careful consideration, the Board has, by resolutions unanimously adopted by the Board: (i) determined that the merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Seagen and its stockholders\u037e (ii) approved and\ndeclared it advisable to enter into the merger agreement and the voting agreement\u037e (iii) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be\nsubmitted to a vote of Seagen stockholders at the special meeting\u037e and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, resolved to\nrecommend that Seagen stockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement and approve the merger on the terms and subject to the\nconditions set forth in the merger agreement (the \u201ccompany board recommendation\u201d). Certain factors considered by the Board in reaching its\ndecision to can be found in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Recommendation of the Board of Directors\u037e Reasons for the Merger.\u201d\nThe Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger agreement proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal.\nOpinion of Centerview Partners LLC (see page 48 and Annex C)\nSeagen retained Centerview Partners LLC (\u201cCenterview\u201d) as financial advisor to the Board in connection with the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement. In connection with this engagement, the Board requested that Centerview evaluate the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, to the holders of shares of our common stock (other than (i) all shares of our common stock that are owned by Seagen as\ntreasury shares and any shares of our common stock owned by Pfizer, Merger Sub, or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer or\nSeagen and (ii) any dissenting shares (the shares referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), together with any shares of our common stock held by any\naffiliate of Seagen or Pfizer, \u201cexcluded shares\u201d)) of the merger consideration proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement.\nOn March 12, 2023, Centerview rendered to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated\nMarch 12, 2023 that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and\nqualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders\nof shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nholders.\nThe full text of Centerview\u2019s written opinion, dated March 12, 2023, which describes the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this\nproxy statement and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. Centerview\u2019s financial advisory services and opinion were provided for\nthe information and assistance of the Board (in the directors\u2019 capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for\npurposes of its consideration of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and Centerview\u2019s opinion addressed\nonly the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date thereof, to the holders of shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) of\nthe merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. Centerview\u2019s opinion did not address any other term or\naspect of the merger agreement, the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and does not constitute a\nrecommendation to \n \n-5- \nTable of Contents\nany Seagen stockholder or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the merger or otherwise act\nwith respect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter. \nThe full text of Centerview\u2019s written opinion should be read carefully in its entirety for a description of the various assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion.\nInterests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 58) \nIn considering the recommendation of the Board that Seagen stockholders adopt the merger agreement, Seagen stockholders should be aware that\nthe executive officers and directors of Seagen have certain interests in the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Seagen stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these\ninterests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and in making their recommendation that Seagen\nstockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement. These interests include, among others, cash severance payments that may be payable\nfollowing a qualifying termination of an executive officer\u2019s employment under employment agreements and the treatment of Seagen equity awards.\nAdditional interests that were considered by the Board include the provision of indemnification and insurance arrangements pursuant to the merger\nagreement. These interests are discussed in more detail in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Interests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement.\nFinancing of the Merger (see page 64) \nCompletion of the merger is not subject to a financing condition. Pfizer and Merger Sub have represented in the merger agreement that, as of the\ndate the closing of the merger occurs (the \u201cclosing date\u201d), Pfizer and Merger Sub will have available sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other\nsources of immediately available funds to pay the amounts required to be paid by Pfizer or Merger Sub, as applicable, pursuant to the merger\nagreement.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger (see page 64) \nWe expect to complete the merger in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including approval of the merger\nagreement proposal by Seagen stockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals and clearances. The merger is subject to various\nregulatory approvals and clearances and other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Seagen or Pfizer could result in the\nmerger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the\nmerger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required approvals.\nRegulatory Approvals and Clearances Required for the Merger (see page 65)\nThe respective obligations of the parties to effect the merger are subject to certain regulatory approvals and clearances. Subject to the terms and\nconditions set forth in the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until (i) the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof)\nunder the HSR Act has expired or been terminated, and (ii) any agreements not to close the transaction with any governmental authority have\nexpired or been terminated. In addition to antitrust approval in the United States, the completion of the merger is conditioned on approvals and\nclearances in accordance with antitrust laws and foreign investment laws in certain other jurisdictions.\n \n-6- \nTable of Contents\nThe merger agreement also provides that if, prior to the effective time of the merger (i) the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (the \u201cCMA\u201d)\nindicates in writing to Pfizer that it has decided to formally investigate the merger and, accordingly, requests Pfizer to submit a merger notice in the\nform prescribed under the Enterprise Act 2002, (ii) the European Commission (the \u201cEC\u201d) indicates in writing to Pfizer that a member state of the\nEuropean Union or the EC is making, or has made, a referral of the merger to the EC under Article 22 of the EU Merger Regulation, or (iii) a merger\ncontrol, foreign direct investment, or national security inquiry or review is initiated or commenced by certain other governmental authorities,\napproval of the merger by the CMA, the EC or such other governmental authority, as the case may be, will be a condition precedent to the\ncompletion of the merger.\nOn April 5, 2023, Pfizer filed a briefing paper with the EC. On April 21, 2023, Pfizer filed a briefing paper with the CMA.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, the FTC or the DOJ (notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR\nAct or the expiration or termination of any agreement with the FTC or the DOJ) could take such action under antitrust laws as they deem necessary\nor desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger and seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Seagen or\nPfizer or imposing other conduct relief. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, any state or non-U.S. governmental authority could\ntake such action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Seagen or Pfizer or imposing other conduct relief. Private parties may also seek\nto take legal action under antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nThere can be no assurance that all of the regulatory approvals described above, or any other regulatory approvals that might be required to\nconsummate the merger, will be sought or obtained and, if obtained, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any approvals, ability to obtain the\napprovals on satisfactory terms or the absence of any litigation challenging such approvals. There can also be no assurance that the FTC, the DOJ\nor any other governmental authority or any private party will not attempt to challenge the merger on antitrust grounds, and, if such a challenge is\nmade, there can be no assurance as to its result. You should read the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Required Efforts to Consummate the\nMerger\u201d for a description of the parties\u2019 obligations with respect to regulatory approvals related to the merger.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger (see page 65) \nAs of April 24, 2023, we are aware of four complaints that have been filed in connection with the merger. The complaints allege, among other things,\nthat certain disclosures in the preliminary proxy statement filed by Seagen on April 14, 2023 in connection with the merger were materially incomplete\nand misleading.\nThe four actions are captioned O\u2019Dell v. Seagen Inc. et al., No. 1:23-cv-03254 (Apr. 19, 2023), filed in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York, Boyd v. Seagen Inc. et al., No. 1:23-cv-03309 (Apr. 20, 2023), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, Wang v. Seagen Inc. et al., No. 1:23-cv-03302 (Apr. 20, 2023), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York, and Ober v. Seagen Inc. et al., No. 1:23-cv-03378 (Apr. 21, 2023), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork. The complaints name Seagen and the current members of the Board as defendants.\nThe complaints allege, among other things, violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78n(a), 78t(a), SEC Rule 14a-9, 17\nC.F.R. 240.14a-9 and 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.100. The complaints seek, among other relief, to enjoin Seagen from consummating the merger and to be awarded\nrescissory damages, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 and expert fees and expenses.\nSeagen believes that the allegations asserted in the complaints are without merit. As of April 24, 2023, Seagen was not aware of the filing of other\nlawsuits challenging the merger or the proxy statement\u037e however, additional lawsuits arising out of the merger or the proxy statement may be filed in\nthe future.\n \n-7- \nTable of Contents\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 95) \nThe exchange of shares of our common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for\nsuch purposes, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) who receives cash\nin the merger in exchange for shares of our common stock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash that the U.S. holder receives pursuant to the merger with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in such shares.\nYou should read the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d and consult your tax advisor regarding the\nparticular tax consequences of the merger to you, including any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing\njurisdiction.\nAppraisal Rights (see page 98) \nIf the merger is completed, Seagen stockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal are entitled to appraisal rights under the\nDGCL in connection with the merger, provided that such stockholders fully comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, which are\nfurther summarized in the section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights,\u201d beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement. In addition, a copy of Section 262 of the\nDGCL, which details the applicable Delaware appraisal statutes, may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available\nwebsite: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. This means that you may be entitled to have the \u201cfair value\u201d of your shares\nof our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, to be paid upon the amount determined to be \u201cfair value,\u201d in lieu of the amount of the merger consideration you would have\nreceived pursuant to the merger agreement, if you follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. The ultimate amount you may\nreceive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount you would have otherwise received under the merger\nagreement if you do not seek appraisal of your shares of our common stock.\nTo exercise your appraisal rights with respect to your shares of our common stock, you must, among other things, deliver a written demand for\nappraisal to Seagen before the vote is taken on the merger agreement proposal and you must not vote (either via the virtual meeting website or by\nproxy) in favor of the merger agreement proposal with respect to such shares of our common stock, and you must continue to hold such shares of\nour common stock from the record date of making the demand for appraisal through the effective time. As such, merely voting against, abstaining or\nfailing to vote on the merger agreement proposal will not by itself preserve your right to appraisal under the DGCL. If you fail to follow exactly the\nprocedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you will lose your appraisal rights.

that such Pfizer performance\ncash award is subject to will be waived, and the award will vest in full upon achievement of performance conditions (and will be\nforfeited if such performance conditions are not achieved).\nNo Solicitation\u037e Adverse Recommendation Changes (see page 77) \nSeagen has agreed that it will not, and will cause its representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or\nknowingly facilitate the making of any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal\u037e\n(ii) enter into any agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any acquisition proposal\u037e or (iii) engage in\nnegotiations or discussions with, or

information concerning Seagen\u2019s business, properties or assets to any person in accordance with a confidentiality agreement\nwith terms not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Seagen than those contained in its confidentiality agreement with Pfizer and may\nparticipate in discussions and negotiations with such person concerning an acquisition proposal if, but only if, such person has submitted a bona\nfide proposal to Seagen relating to such acquisition proposal that (i) did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the\nmerger agreement, and (ii) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors, either constitutes or could reasonably be\nexpected to lead to a superior proposal.\nPrior to obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, if Seagen receives an acquisition proposal, the Board may effect an adverse\nrecommendation change or terminate the merger agreement to enter an agreement\n \n-10- \nTable of Contents\nproviding for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any superior proposal if, but only if, the Board concludes in good faith, after\nconsultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal and determines in good\nfaith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties\nto Seagen stockholders in accordance with law, so long as Seagen has first complied with certain terms of the merger agreement, including (i)\nnotifying Pfizer of its intent with respect to a superior proposal and negotiating with Pfizer in good faith regarding adjustments proposed by Pfizer to\nthe terms of the merger agreement for a period of four business days, subject to additional two-business-day negotiation periods if the terms of the\nsuperior proposal are materially revised during such negotiation

        "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER": {
            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following are brief answers to certain questions that you, as a stockholder of Seagen, may have regarding the merger agreement, the merger, the\nspecial meeting and the proposals being considered at the special meeting. Seagen urges you to carefully read the remainder of this proxy statement\nbecause the information in this section does not provide all the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger agreement, the\nmerger and the special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference\ninto, this proxy statement.\n \nQ.\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\n \nA.\nThe Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to Seagen stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be\nvoted at the special meeting.\n \nQ.\nWhat is the purpose of the special meeting?\n \nA.\nAt the special meeting, stockholders will consider and act upon the matters outlined in the notice of meeting on the cover page of this proxy\nstatement, namely:\n \n\u2022\nthe merger agreement proposal\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe compensation proposal.\n \nQ.\nWhere and when is the special meeting?\n \nA.\nThe special meeting of stockholders of Seagen is scheduled to be held on May 30, 2023 at 12:00 p.m. (Pacific time), via the Internet at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SGEN2023SM. Online check-in will begin at 11:45 a.m. (Pacific time), and you should allow ample time for the\ncheck-in procedures. At the special meeting, stockholders who owned shares of our common stock as of the record date will be able to attend, vote\nand submit questions via the Internet by logging in to the virtual meeting website using the 16-digit control number provided to you on your proxy\ncard. If you do not have a control number, you may attend the special meeting in listen-only mode by visiting\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SGEN2023SM, but you will not be able to vote or to submit questions. Whether or not you plan to attend the\nspecial meeting, we urge you to vote and submit your proxy in advance of the special meeting by one of the methods described in these proxy\nmaterials. You will not be able to attend the special meeting in person.\n \nQ.\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?\n \nA.\nThe Board recommends that you vote as follows:\n \n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the merger agreement proposal\u037e and\n \n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal.\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board to vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal, Seagen stockholders should be aware that\nSeagen\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Seagen\nstockholders generally. For a more complete description of these interests, see the information provided in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nInterests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement.\n \nQ.\nWhat will I receive in the merger?\n \nA.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of our common stock issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares\n \n-14-Table of Contents\nof our common stock to be cancelled or converted in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and\nany dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $229.00, without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes.\n \nQ.\nHow does the merger consideration compare to the market price of Seagen common stock prior to the announcement of the merger?\n \nA.\nThe merger consideration of $229.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 42% to the closing price of $161.37 per share of our common\nstock on February 24, 2023, the last trading day prior to the first media accounts regarding a possible acquisition of Seagen by Pfizer, and a premium\nof approximately 54% to the 30-trading day volume-weighted average share price of $148.42 per share of our common stock on that same date.\nOn April 21, 2023, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was first mailed to our stockholders, the closing price for our\ncommon stock on the Nasdaq was $203.80 per share of our common stock. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our common\nstock in connection with voting your shares of our common stock.\n \nQ.\nWhat will happen in the merger?\n \nA.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL,\nMerger Sub will be merged with and into Seagen at the effective time. At the effective time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will\ncease, and Seagen will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. As a result of the merger, our\ncommon stock will no longer be publicly traded and you will no longer have any interest in the future earnings or growth of Seagen or Pfizer. In\naddition, our common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Seagen will no longer be required to file\nperiodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) with respect to our common stock, in each case, in accordance with\napplicable law, rules and regulations.\n \nQ.\nWhat vote is required to adopt the merger agreement?\n \nA.\nAssuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d approval of the merger agreement proposal.\nIn addition, pursuant to the voting agreement, until the Expiration Time, at the special meeting (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof),\nBaker Bros. will cause each stockholder identified in the voting agreement to be represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting (or cause\nthe holders of record as of the record date to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order for the Covered Shares to be counted\nas present for purposes of establishing a quorum and to cause the Covered Shares to be voted in favor of the merger agreement proposal. At the\nclose of business on the record date, the Covered Shares represented approximately 25.0% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock.\n \nQ.\nWhat vote is required to approve (on a non-binding, advisory basis) the compensation proposal?\n \nA.\nAssuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes\ncast affirmatively or negatively on the matter. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the approval of the compensation proposal.\n \n-15-\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to\nSeagen\u2019s named executive officers that relates to the merger?\n \nA.\nThe SEC rules require Seagen to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain payments that will, or may be made to\nSeagen\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the merger. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cAdvisory Vote on Named\nExecutive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Arrangements (Proposal 2)\u201d beginning on page 90 of this proxy statement.\n \nQ.\nWhat will happen if Seagen stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal?\n \nA.\nThe vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger agreement proposal. Accordingly, a stockholder\nmay vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the\ncompensation proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on Seagen, Pfizer or Merger Sub. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is\nadopted by Seagen stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to Seagen\u2019s named executive officers\nto the extent payable in accordance with the terms of their respective compensation agreements and arrangements even if the stockholders do not\napprove the compensation proposal.\n \nQ.\nAre there any voting agreements related to the merger?\n \nA.\nBaker Bros. has entered into the voting agreement with Pfizer and Seagen, pursuant to which it has agreed, on the terms and subject to the\nconditions set forth in the voting agreement, to, among other things: (I) cause each stockholder identified in the voting agreement to be\nrepresented in person or by proxy at the special meeting (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof) (or cause the holders of record on\nany applicable record date to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order for the Covered Shares to be counted as present for\npurposes of establishing a quorum and to cause the Covered Shares to be voted in favor of the merger agreement proposal\u037e and (II) vote (including\nvia proxy) (or cause the holder of record on the record date to vote (including via proxy)) all of the Covered Shares: (a) in favor of the merger\nagreement proposal\u037e and (b) against (1) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to Seagen\u2019s\nobligations to complete the merger not being fulfilled or result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or\nagreement of Seagen contained in the merger agreement, or of Baker Bros. contained in the voting agreement and (2) any acquisition proposal, or\nany agreement, transaction or other matter that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, impede or interfere with the consummation of\nthe merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nAt the close of business on the record date, the Covered Shares represented approximately 25.0% of the outstanding voting power of our common\nstock.\n \nQ.\nDo any of Seagen\u2019s directors or executive officers have any interests in the merger agreement that are different from, or in addition to, my\ninterests as a Seagen stockholder?\n \nA.\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board that Seagen stockholders adopt the merger agreement, Seagen stockholders should be aware that\nthe executive officers and directors of Seagen have certain interests in the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Seagen stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these\ninterests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and in making their recommendation that Seagen\nstockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement. These interests include, among others, cash severance payments that may be payable\nfollowing a qualifying termination of an executive officer\u2019s employment under employment agreements and the treatment of Seagen equity awards.\nAdditional interests that were considered by the Board include the provision of indemnification and insurance arrangements pursuant to the merger\nagreement. These interests\n \n-16-\nTable of Contents\nare discussed in more detail in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning\non page 58 of this proxy statement.\n \nQ.\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\n \nA.\nWe expect to complete the merger in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including the approval of Seagen\nstockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals and clearances. The merger is subject to various regulatory approvals and clearances and\nother conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Seagen or Pfizer could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or\nnot at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the\nmerger promptly following the receipt of all required approvals.\n \nQ.\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger?\n \nA.\nThe exchange of shares of our common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for\nsuch purposes, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page\n95 of this proxy statement) who receives cash in the merger in exchange for shares of our common stock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that the U.S. holder receives pursuant to the merger\nwith respect to such shares and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares.\nYou should read the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d and consult your tax adviser regarding the\nparticular tax consequences of the merger to you, including any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing\njurisdiction.\n \nQ.\nWho is entitled to vote at the special meeting?\n \nA.\nThe record date for the special meeting is April 17, 2023. Only common stockholders of record at the close of business on that date are entitled to\nattend and vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on all\nmatters that come before the special meeting.\n \nQ.\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Seagen common stock after the record date but before the special meeting?\n \nA.\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date on which the merger is expected to be completed.\nIf you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as\nprovision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of our common stock, and each of\nyou notifies Seagen in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration, if the merger is\ncompleted, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the\nspecial meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and\nreturn the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in\naccordance with the instructions detailed in the section entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u201d beginning on page 24 of this proxy statement).\n \nQ.\nWho may attend the special meeting?\n \nA.\nOnly stockholders as of the close of business on April 17, 2023, or their duly appointed proxies, and invited guests of Seagen may attend the\nspecial meeting via the virtual meeting website. \u201cStreet name\u201d holders (those whose shares of our common stock are held through a broker, bank or\nother nominee) who wish to\n \n-17-\nTable of Contents\nvote at the special meeting must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote your\nshares of our common stock at the special meeting.\n \nQ.\nWho is soliciting my vote?\n \nA.\nThe Board is soliciting your proxy, and Seagen will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree M&A Incorporated (\u201cInnisfree\u201d) has been retained\nto assist with the solicitation of proxies. Innisfree will be paid approximately $25,000 in total and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket\nexpenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies\nand proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians and other like parties to the beneficial owners of shares of our common\nstock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by\ntelephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by Seagen or certain of Seagen\u2019s\ndirectors, officers and employees.\n \nQ.\nWhat do I need to do now?\n \nA.\nCarefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including its annexes. Whether or\nnot you expect to attend the special meeting by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, please submit a proxy to vote your shares of\nour common stock as promptly as possible so that your shares of our common stock may be represented and voted at the special meeting. A failure\nto vote your shares of our common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the\nmerger agreement.\n \nQ.\nHow do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?\n \nA.\nIf you are a stockholder of record, there are four methods by which you may vote at the special meeting:\n \n\u2022\nInternet: To vote over the Internet, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote over the Internet, you do not have to mail\nin a proxy card.\n \n\u2022\nTelephone: To vote by telephone, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote by telephone, you do not have to mail in a\nproxy card.\n \n\u2022\nMail: To vote by mail, complete, sign and date a proxy card and return it promptly in the postage-paid envelope provided. If you return your\nsigned proxy card to us before the special meeting, we will vote your shares of our common stock as you direct.\n \n\u2022\nVirtually During the Special Meeting: To vote your shares of our common stock during the special meeting, click on the vote button\nprovided on the screen and follow the instructions provided. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the special meeting during the\ncheck-in or meeting time, please call the technical support number that will be posted on the log in page.\nWhether or not you plan to attend the special meeting by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, as applicable, we urge you to vote\nby proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the special meeting if you have already voted by proxy. We encourage you to vote\nover the Internet or by telephone, both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail. \n \nQ.\nHow do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker (street name)?\n \nA.\nIf your shares of our common stock are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, often referred to as held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you will receive a\nform from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares of our common stock should be voted. You should contact\nyour broker, bank or other nominee with questions about how to provide or revoke your instructions.\n \n-18-\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nCan I change my vote after I submit my proxy?\n \nA.\nYes. You have the right to revoke a proxy at any time prior to the taking of the vote at the special meeting. You may revoke your proxy prior to the\ntaking of the vote at the special meeting, by submitting a new proxy to vote your shares of our common stock over the Internet or by telephone\n(only your latest Internet or telephone proxy is counted), by signing a later-dated new proxy and mailing it, in each case, in accordance with the\ninstructions on the enclosed proxy card or by sending a written revocation of your proxy to Seagen prior to the special meeting. In addition, you\nmay revoke your proxy by attending the special meeting virtually and voting\u037e however, attending the special meeting virtually will not revoke your\nwritten, Internet or telephone proxy, as the case may be, unless you specifically request revocation or vote in person at the special meeting.\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may change your instruction to your bank, broker or other\nnominee, as applicable, by submitting a subsequent instruction to such bank, broker or other nominee, or you may also change your vote by\nobtaining a legal proxy, executed in your favor from the holder of record, and voting your shares in person at the special meeting.\n \nQ.\nIf the merger is completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares of Seagen common stock?\n \nA.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each eligible share will be automatically canceled and\nwill cease to exist, and will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding\ntaxes. If your shares of our common stock are evidenced by stock certificates, after the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal\nand related materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of our common stock.\nHolders of book-entry shares will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent to receive the merger\nconsideration. If your shares of our common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions\nfrom your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange\nfor the merger consideration.\n \nQ.\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\n \nA.\nNo. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of common stock now or with your proxy card.\n \nQ.\nAm I entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL instead of receiving the merger consideration for my shares of Seagen\u2019s common\nstock?\n \nA.\nStockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the\nDGCL in connection with the merger if they take certain actions and meet certain conditions. For additional information, see the section entitled\n\u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement. In addition, a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL, which details the applicable\nDelaware appraisal statute, may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.\nFailure to strictly comply with all procedures required by Section 262 of the DGCL will result in a loss of your right to appraisal. We encourage you\nto read these provisions carefully and in their entirety and, in view of their complexity, to promptly consult with your legal and financial advisors if\nyou wish to pursue your appraisal rights in connection with the merger.\n \nQ.\nHow many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the special meeting?\n \nA.\nThe presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power of the\nshares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled\n \n-19-\nTable of Contents\nto vote thereat will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be\npresent at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Seagen to additional expense.\nPursuant to the voting agreement, Baker Bros. has agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the voting agreement, to cause\neach stockholder identified in the voting agreement to be represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting (and at every adjournment or\npostponement thereof) (or cause the holders of record on any applicable record date to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in\norder for the Covered Shares to be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. At the close of business on the record date, the\nCovered Shares represented approximately 25.0% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock.\n \nQ.\nWhat if I abstain from voting?\n \nA.\nIf you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal, your shares of our common stock will\nstill be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. If you abstain from voting or fail to vote your shares of our common stock (including\nthe failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d by a broker to give voting instructions to the broker), that abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as if you voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe merger agreement proposal. However, abstentions and a failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares of our common stock\nwill have no effect on the approval of the compensation proposal, assuming a quorum is present.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of our common stock should be voted on a matter, the\nshares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the merger agreement proposal\u037e and (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation\nproposal.\n \nQ.\nWhat is a broker non-vote?\n \nA.\nEach \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but will have no effect on the\ncompensation proposal. Broker non-votes are shares of our common stock held by brokers that are present in person or by proxy at the special\nmeeting, but with respect to which the broker is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares of our common stock how to vote on a\nparticular proposal, and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers do not have discretionary voting\nauthority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d does not give voting instructions to the broker, then those shares of our common stock will not be present in person or by proxy at the\nspecial meeting. For shares of our common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d only shares of our common stock affirmatively voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal\nto adopt the merger agreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the special\nmeeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Seagen does not expect any broker non-votes at the special\nmeeting.\n \nQ.\nWhat is a proxy?\n \nA.\nA proxy is a Seagen stockholder\u2019s legal designation of another person to vote shares of our common stock owned by such Seagen stockholder on\ntheir behalf. If you are a Seagen stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the\ninstructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. If you hold shares of our common stock beneficially in \u201cstreet name\u201d, you should follow the\nvoting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.\n \n-20-\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nIf a Seagen stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of our common stock voted?\n \nA.\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies will vote your shares of our\ncommon stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your\nshares of our common stock should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come\nbefore the special meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of our common stock should be voted on a matter, the\nshares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the merger agreement proposal\u037e and (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation\nproposal.\n \nQ.\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?\n \nA.\nThis means you own shares of our common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For example, you may\nown some shares of our common stock directly as a stockholder of record and other shares of our common stock through a broker or you may own\nshares of our common stock through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign\nand return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order\nto vote all of the shares of our common stock you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit\nyour proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.\n \nQ.\nWill my shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?\n \nA.\nNo. Because any shares of our common stock you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares\nyou hold of record, any shares of our common stock so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of our common stock you hold\nof record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor,\nyou will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of our common stock because they are held in a different\nform of record ownership. Shares of our common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the\nentity. Shares of our common stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.\n \nQ.\nCan I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?\n \nA.\nIf you are unable to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card or to vote over the Internet or\nby telephone.\n \nQ.\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\n \nA.\nSeagen intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and to publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will\nbe filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Seagen files with the SEC are publicly available.\n \nQ.\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\n \nA.\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by Seagen stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Seagen stockholders will not\nreceive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, shares of our common stock will continue to be\nlisted and traded on the Nasdaq. The merger agreement provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain\n \n-21-\nTable of Contents\ncircumstances, Seagen may be required to pay to Pfizer a termination fee of $1,646 million in cash. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\n\u2014Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 87 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which such a termination fee may be\nrequired to be paid. The merger agreement also provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain other circumstances, Pfizer\nmay be required to pay to Seagen a reverse termination fee of $2,224 million in cash. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Reverse\nTermination Fee\u201d beginning on page 88 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which such a reverse termination fee\nmay be required to be paid.\n \nQ.\nHow can I obtain additional information about Seagen?\n \nA.\nSeagen will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2022, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, without charge to any stockholder\nwho makes a written request to our Corporate Secretary at 21823 30th Drive SE, Bothell, Washington 98021. Seagen\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nand other SEC filings may also be accessed at www.sec.gov or on Seagen\u2019s Investor Relations website at https://investor.seagen.com. Seagen\u2019s\nwebsite address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is not part of this\nproxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other reference to our website provided in this proxy statement.\n \nQ.\nHow many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another stockholder?\n \nA.\nThe SEC\u2019s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to\ntwo or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly\nreferred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. Seagen and some brokers\nmay be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to multiple stockholders who request a copy and share an\naddress, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in\nhouseholding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you\nwish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if your shares of our common stock are held in a\nbrokerage account or Seagen if you are a stockholder of record by sending a written request to our Corporate Secretary at 21823 30th Drive SE,\nBothell, Washington 98021 or calling (425) 527-4000. In addition, Seagen will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or\ntelephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement.\n \nQ.\nWho should I contact if I have any questions?\n \nA.\nIf you have questions about the merger or the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting or desire additional copies of this proxy statement\nor additional proxy cards or otherwise need assistance voting, you should contact:\n \nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, NY 10022\nShareholders may call toll free: (877) 800-5194 \nBanks and Brokers may call collect: (212) 750-5833 \n \n-22-\nTable of Contents",

Certain factors considered by the Board in reaching its decision can be found in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of\nthe Board of Directors\u037e Reasons for the Merger, beginning on page 45 of this proxy statement.\u201d\nOur stockholders must approve the merger agreement proposal in order for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to approve the merger agreement\nproposal, the merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read\ncarefully and in its entirety.\nThe vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger agreement proposal. Accordingly, a stockholder may\nvote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the\ncompensation proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on Seagen, Pfizer or Merger Sub. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted\nby Seagen stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to\n \n-24-Table of Contents\nSeagen\u2019s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of their respective compensation agreements and arrangements\neven if the stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that Seagen stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d each of the above proposals.\nRecord Date\u037e Stockholders Entitled to Vote",

If the merger is completed, any Seagen stockholder who does not vote in favor of the merger agreement\nproposal and who otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL has the right to seek appraisal of such person\u2019s shares of our\ncommon stock and to receive payment in cash for the \u201cfair value\u201d of such person\u2019s shares of our common stock, as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery, to be paid upon the amount determined to be \u201cfair value,\u201d in lieu of the amount of the merger consideration you would have received pursuant\nto the merger agreement. The ultimate amount you may receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount you would\nhave otherwise received under the merger agreement if you do not seek appraisal of your shares of our common stock.\nTo exercise your appraisal rights with respect to your shares of our common stock, you must, among other things, deliver a written demand for appraisal\nto Seagen before the vote is taken on the merger agreement proposal, and you must not vote (either via live webcast at the virtual meeting website or by\nproxy) in favor of the merger agreement proposal with respect to such shares of our common stock, and you must continue to hold such shares of our\ncommon stock from the record date of making the demand for appraisal through the effective time. As such, merely voting against, abstaining or failing to\nvote on the merger agreement proposal will not by itself preserve your right to appraisal under the DGCL. If you fail to follow exactly the procedures set\nforth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you will lose your appraisal rights. The requirements for exercising appraisal rights are further described in the section\nentitled \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement. In addition, a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL, which details the applicable\nDelaware appraisal statute, may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. We encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. If you hold your\nshares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank,\nbroker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures. In view of the complexity of the DGCL, Seagen stockholders who may wish to pursue\nappraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors promptly. The discussion of appraisal rights in this proxy statement is not a full summary\nof the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL, and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, accessible without\nsubscription or costs at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.\nAdjournment",

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Board and Seagen\u2019s executive leadership team regularly meet and consider Seagen\u2019s long-term strategy, including Seagen\u2019s efforts to build and scale\na global oncology company that develops and commercializes new and innovative targeted treatments for cancer patients. As part of their regular review,\nthe Board and Seagen\u2019s executive leadership team continually assess Seagen\u2019s business, financial prospects and opportunities to enhance stockholder\nvalue, including Seagen\u2019s ongoing buildout of a new biomanufacturing facility in Everett, Washington, Seagen\u2019s products and pipeline, additional global\nexpansion of clinical and commercial capabilities, capital raising opportunities, prospective acquisition and licensing transactions, and other strategic\nopportunities.\nDuring October 2019, Seagen\u2019s then chairman and chief executive officer met with a senior executive of a global biopharmaceutical company which we\nrefer to as \u201cCompany A\u201d, at which time Company A suggested exploring a potential strategic transaction with Seagen.\nBeginning in early December 2019 and continuing through March 2020, representatives of Seagen, including Seagen\u2019s then chairman and chief executive\nofficer, had a number of communications and meetings with representatives of Company A, which made a series of six proposals to Seagen. These\nproposals ranged from (i) a potential strategic collaboration between Company A and Seagen with respect to certain of Seagen\u2019s commercialized and\npipeline products together with a purchase by Company A of a 20% equity stake in Seagen, (ii) an acquisition of Seagen by Company A where,\nimmediately prior to such acquisition, Seagen would spin off to Seagen stockholders a new company (a \u201cSpinCo\u201d) that would serve as a discovery and\nearly development engine, and (iii) an acquisition of Seagen by Company A for $200 per share in cash. Between December 1, 2019 and March 31, 2020, our\ncommon stock traded in a price range between $90.57 and $124.32 per share.\nThe Board met regularly from December 2019 through April 2020 to discuss these proposals and provide guidance and direction directly to Seagen\u2019s then\nchairman and chief executive officer. The Board meetings from January 18, 2020 through April 2020 included representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP,\nSeagen\u2019s outside M&A counsel (\u201cSullivan & Cromwell\u201d), which provided legal advice to the Board. At a Board meeting on January 27, 2020, it was the\nconsensus of the Board that Seagen should engage Centerview to support management in preparing a standalone financial valuation of Seagen. The\nBoard selected Centerview for this mandate based on, among other considerations, Centerview\u2019s reputation, experience and knowledge of the\nbiopharmaceutical industry and experience with merger and acquisition transactions in that industry. At a meeting on February 4, 2020, Seagen\u2019s chief\nfinancial officer reviewed with the directors management\u2019s projections for the future financial performance of Seagen on a standalone basis. At a meeting\non March 13, 2020, representatives of Centerview reviewed with the directors various preliminary financial analyses concerning the then current proposal\nfrom Company A.\nAt each juncture in these discussions with Company A, it was the consensus of the Board that (a) Company A\u2019s proposals with respect to a SpinCo were\nnot acceptable, and (b) the per-share transaction prices proposed by Company A in respect of an acquisition of Seagen by Company A were not\nadequate. In mid-April 2020, Seagen and Company A ceased discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Seagen, including any spin off. Throughout\nthe remainder of 2020 and into the spring of 2022, Seagen and the Board continued to evaluate strategic collaborations with various global\nbiopharmaceutical companies to enhance stockholder value and executed on certain of these collaborations over that period. These executed\ncollaborations included (a) a September 2020 strategic collaboration providing for (i) the co-development and co-commercialization of Seagen\u2019s antibody-\ndrug conjugate (\u201cADC\u201d) ladiratuzumab vedotin globally, for which Seagen received a $600 million upfront payment, and (ii) an acquisition of $1 billion\n \n-34-Table of Contents\nof our common stock at a price of $200 per share, (b) an August 2021 strategic collaboration providing for the exclusive worldwide license and co-\ndevelopment of disitamab vedotin, for which Seagen made a $200 million upfront payment, and (c) a March 2022 strategic collaboration providing for the\nco-design, development, and commercialization of ADCs for up to three cancer targets.\nOn February 4, 2022, Seagen\u2019s then chairman and chief executive officer met with representatives of Company A at Company A\u2019s request. At this meeting,\nrepresentatives of Company A expressed Company A\u2019s interest in acquiring Seagen at a transaction price in the range of $235 to $245 per share. Seagen\u2019s\nthen chairman and chief executive officer communicated this indication of interest to the Board, and on February 7, 2022, the Board met, together with\nmembers of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Centerview. Seagen\u2019s then chairman and chief executive officer updated\nthe directors on his discussion with Company A, including Company A\u2019s indication of interest. A discussion ensued regarding Seagen\u2019s prospects as a\nstandalone company and the range of transaction values mentioned by Company A. On February 10, 2022, the Board met again, together with members of\nsenior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Centerview. Representatives of Centerview reviewed various preliminary financial\nanalyses with the Board.\nOn February 17, 2022, the Board met again, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell. After discussion,\nthe consensus of the Board was that Seagen\u2019s then chairman and chief executive officer should continue discussions with Company A regarding a\npotential transaction, and the Board provided Seagen\u2019s then chairman and chief executive officer with guidance and direction for negotiating the financial\nand other terms for a potential transaction.\nOn both February 21 and February 22, 2022, Seagen\u2019s then chairman and chief executive officer and Company A\u2019s chief executive officer discussed\nCompany A\u2019s indication of interest, including perspectives on financial and other terms for a potential transaction.\nOn February 24, 2022, at the direction of Seagen, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell provided to representatives of Company A\u2019s outside counsel a\nterm sheet containing certain proposed provisions for a potential merger agreement, which focused on transaction certainty. Representatives of Seagen\nand Company A, together with representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Company A\u2019s outside M&A counsel, continued to negotiate transaction\ncertainty provisions in various discussions during March and April, 2022. During this period of discussion of a potential transaction, Seagen and\nCompany A entered into a non-disclosure agreement, the terms of which included a standstill obligation that expired upon Seagen\u2019s entry into the merger\nagreement.\nOn March 14, 2022, representatives of Seagen gave a technical presentation to representatives of Company A regarding Seagen\u2019s programs and\ntechnology.\nOn April 12, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management. At this meeting, the directors discussed the status of the potential\ntransaction with Company A.\nOn May 5, 2022, Company A submitted a written proposal to acquire Seagen at a transaction price of $230 per share in cash, subject to completion of\nconfirmatory due diligence, together with certain proposed provisions for a potential merger agreement. Later on May 5, 2022, the Board met to discuss\nCompany A\u2019s proposal. Members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview, MTS Health Partners LP (\u201cMTS\u201d) and\nSeagen\u2019s outside securities counsel attended the meeting. Prior to the meeting, the Board determined to engage MTS to provide financial advice based\non, among other considerations, MTS\u2019s familiarity with Seagen, its business and its products. Felix Baker, then Seagen\u2019s lead independent director,\nupdated the directors on Company A\u2019s proposal, and the directors discussed this proposal. A representative of Centerview summarized for the directors\nthe preliminary financial analyses reviewed with the directors in February 2022. The directors, in consultation with representatives of Centerview,\ndiscussed whether one or more additional third parties, including global biopharmaceutical companies, could undertake an acquisition of Seagen.\nRepresentatives of Centerview and MTS commented on the financial capability of several such companies and provided their perspective concerning\nthose companies\u2019 probable level of strategic interest in Seagen, as well as their respective abilities\n \n-35-\nTable of Contents\nand probable level of motivation for commencing and completing negotiations and diligence on a timely basis. After discussion, it was the consensus of\nthe Board that Dr. Baker should assume the lead role in negotiating on behalf of Seagen with Company A.\nOn May 6, 2022, the Board met to further discuss Company A\u2019s proposal. Members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell,\nCenterview, MTS, and Seagen\u2019s outside securities counsel attended the meeting. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that while certain\nportions of Company A\u2019s proposal were acceptable, Dr. Baker should convey to Company A that the transaction price proposed by Company A was not\nacceptable. Later on May 6, 2022, Dr. Baker conveyed a counterproposal to Company A, indicating that he would be prepared to recommend to the Board\nthat it accept certain terms set out in Company A\u2019s proposal, provided that the transaction price was at least $235 per share.\nOn May 9, 2022, Company A reiterated its previously proposed transaction price of $230 per share.\nOn May 11, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. Dr.\nBaker updated the directors on the discussions with Company A. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that Dr. Baker should communicate\nto Company A that while Seagen did not agree to the transaction price being proposed by Company A, Seagen was prepared to provide additional\ndetailed information to Company A and undertake preliminary contract negotiations with a view to enhancing the transaction price and terms. The\ndirectors also discussed the potential benefits and risks of contacting third parties to solicit proposals to acquire Seagen. Representatives of Centerview\nand MTS expressed their view as to the viability of receiving actionable bids from private equity sponsors and reviewed with the directors various global\nbiopharmaceutical companies in terms of their financial ability to undertake an acquisition of this size, likely strategic interest in Seagen, and ability to\ncommence and complete an acquisition process expeditiously. The directors, in consultation with representatives of Centerview, MTS and Sullivan &\nCromwell, discussed the likelihood that a party could provide a proposal that was competitive with Company A\u2019s proposal, the utility of discussions with\nanother party in maintaining leverage on Company A, the utility of developing alternative strategic options, and the risk and potential impact of a media\nleak on Seagen\u2019s operations, strategy and employees. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board not to reach out to third parties at such time,\nbut to revisit this topic as discussions with Company A progressed.\nOn May 15, 2022, Seagen\u2019s then chairman and chief executive officer resigned as chairman and chief executive officer, with Dr. Baker being appointed as\nchairman and Dr. Roger Dansey, who had been previously appointed as interim chief executive officer, remaining in such position.\nOn the evening of May 15, 2022, Company A received access to due diligence materials (including access to a virtual data room) and commenced due\ndiligence of detailed information provided by Seagen, including participating in management meetings and due diligence sessions with Seagen.\nOn May 19, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. The\nCenterview representatives reviewed the status of diligence discussions with Company A, as well as preliminary financial perspectives related to the\nvalue of Seagen including possible value attributable to Seagen\u2019s then-ongoing arbitration with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Ltd. (\u201cDaiichi Sankyo\u201d). The\nconsensus of the Board was that Dr. Baker should approach Company A to proffer an additional due diligence meeting in order to provide Company A\nwith further information in an effort to increase the transaction price that Company A was willing to pay. The directors next discussed that, following\nannouncement of the change in Seagen\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer roles, representatives of two global biopharmaceutical companies, which\nwe refer to as \u201cCompany B\u201d and \u201cCompany C,\u201d had separately indicated to certain directors their respective interest in discussing a potential strategic\ntransaction with Seagen. With respect to Company C specifically, Dr. Baker informed the Board that he had received an inbound call from Company C\u2019s\nfinancial advisor to facilitate a call between Dr. Baker and Company C\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, but that no call was ultimately placed by\nCompany C\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer. A\n \n-36-\nTable of Contents\nrepresentative of Centerview reviewed information concerning Company B and advised the Board that, given Company B\u2019s size, capital structure and\nbalance sheet, any consideration in a transaction with Company B would have to be all or mostly stock, as a result of which Seagen stockholders would\nhold a majority of the combined company. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that Seagen communicate to Company B\u2019s chief executive\nofficer that Seagen was not interested in discussing a combination with Company B at this time. A representative of Centerview reviewed information\nconcerning Company C and advised the Board that, given Company C\u2019s capital structure and balance sheet, the consideration in a transaction with\nCompany C would need to consist at least partly of stock. A Centerview representative also reviewed Company C\u2019s financial position and strategic focus,\ncommenting on Company C\u2019s ability to complete a transaction with Seagen. After discussion, the consensus of the Board was that Seagen should not\nreach out to Company C, but could remain open to a potential incoming proposal from Company C. The directors, in consultation with representatives of\nSullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS, next discussed the desirability of reaching out to additional potential bidders, with particular focus on Pfizer\nand another global biopharmaceutical company which we refer to as \u201cCompany D\u201d. The discussion focused on the respective financial capacity of Pfizer\nand Company D, the respective strategic benefit of a combination between Seagen and Pfizer or Company D, the capacity of Seagen\u2019s executive\nleadership team to manage discussions with one or more additional companies in addition to Company A, the likelihood that either Pfizer or Company D\nwould be interested in a potential acquisition of Seagen, the likely extent to which a transaction with either Pfizer or Company D would need to include\nstock, and the risk of media leaks. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that a representative of Centerview should inquire whether Pfizer\nwould be prepared to evaluate a potential acquisition of Seagen.\nOn May 19, 2022, a representative of Centerview spoke to Albert Bourla, Pfizer\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, to inquire whether Pfizer would be\nprepared to evaluate a potential acquisition of Seagen.\nOn May 20, 2022, Aamir Malik, Pfizer\u2019s chief business innovation officer, called a representative of Centerview. Mr. Malik noted that Pfizer had been\nassessing Seagen for some time and indicated that Pfizer would be interested in exploring a potential acquisition of Seagen and would like to receive a\npresentation from Seagen management. Later that day, at the direction of Seagen, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell provided a draft non-disclosure\nagreement to Pfizer.\nOn May 22, 2022, Company A\u2019s outside M&A counsel provided a draft merger agreement to Sullivan & Cromwell for a proposed acquisition of Seagen by\nCompany A. Company A\u2019s outside M&A counsel also provided a draft voting agreement to Sullivan & Cromwell pursuant to which Baker Bros. and its\naffiliates would agree to vote in favor of the potential transaction with Company A. Drafts of these documents continued to be negotiated into July 2022.\nAlso on May 22, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management. Dr. Baker updated the directors on the status of discussions with\nPfizer and with Company A.\nOn May 24, 2022, following an exchange of drafts, Pfizer executed a non-disclosure agreement. The non-disclosure agreement had a standstill provision\nthat by its terms would expire on June 30, 2023, but the non-disclosure agreement provided that Pfizer could make proposals on a confidential basis to the\nchairman of Seagen, and that the standstill would terminate if Seagen entered into a definitive agreement providing for an acquisition of 50% or more of\nSeagen\u2019s outstanding stock.\nOn May 25, 2022 Seagen provided a management presentation to Pfizer.\nOn June 1, 2022, Pfizer\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer submitted a written proposal to acquire Seagen at a transaction price in the range of $210 to\n$220 per share in cash. Also on June 1, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell,\nCenterview and MTS. A Centerview representative updated the directors on discussions with Pfizer, including the due diligence information made\navailable to Pfizer to date. The directors, in consultation with representatives of Centerview and MTS, discussed their objective of securing a higher\ntransaction value from Pfizer and the best tactics for doing so. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that Centerview should communicate\nto Pfizer that its transaction price was not adequate, but that Seagen was willing to provide Pfizer with access to additional\n \n-37-\nTable of Contents\ndetailed information and make available representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell to discuss legal matters, with a view to receiving early in the week of June\n13, 2022 an updated written proposal from Pfizer reflecting a meaningful improvement in the terms of its June 1 proposal, together with a markup of a draft\nmerger agreement to be provided by Sullivan & Cromwell. Later that day, a representative of Centerview conveyed this to Deborah Baron, Pfizer\u2019s senior\nvice president, worldwide business development. During the June 1 Board meeting, a Centerview representative also reviewed with the directors the\nstatus of discussions with Company A, and explained that Company A would likely conclude due diligence during the week of June 13, 2022.\nOn June 2, 2022, Pfizer received access to due diligence materials (including access to a virtual data room) and commenced due diligence of detailed\ninformation provided by Seagen, including participating in management meetings and due diligence sessions with Seagen.\nOn June 3, 2022, the chief executive officer of Company D contacted Dr. Baker. Dr. Baker and the chief executive officer of Company D spoke the following\nday. During this discussion, the chief executive officer of Company D expressed Company D\u2019s interest in acquiring Seagen. Dr. Baker informed the chief\nexecutive officer of Company D that Seagen was in a position of strength, but could be open to a discussion if Company D would be willing to pay a\nsubstantial biotech premium. The chief executive officer of Company D indicated that he wished to discuss a specific proposal with Dr. Baker after a\nmeeting of Company D\u2019s board of directors later that week.\nOn June 5, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell. Representatives of Sullivan &\nCromwell reviewed with the directors the status of merger agreement negotiations with Company A, as well as the merger agreement that representatives\nof Sullivan & Cromwell had prepared to send to Pfizer. The directors then provided guidance and direction to Sullivan & Cromwell. Dr. Baker also updated\nthe directors on his discussion with Company D\u2019s chief executive officer the prior day. The directors discussed whether to broaden discussions to\ninclude other potential parties, whether a broader process may yield a higher transaction price, Seagen\u2019s likely ability under any merger agreement to\nreceive and accept a higher transaction price from a third party under comparable terms, the risks of overextending management resources by engaging\nwith too many parties, the impact of any potential media leaks on Seagen and the transaction negotiations, and other considerations. After discussion,\nthe consensus of the Board was that Pfizer and Company A represented the two global biopharmaceutical companies with the greatest financial\nwherewithal to complete a transaction, and the two global biopharmaceutical companies with the greatest probable strategic interest in Seagen.\nLater on June 5, 2022, at the direction of Seagen, Sullivan & Cromwell provided a revised draft merger agreement to Company A\u2019s outside M&A counsel.\nAt the direction of Seagen, Sullivan & Cromwell also provided a draft merger agreement to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d), Pfizer\u2019s\noutside legal counsel. The draft merger agreement included a hell-or-high-water regulatory covenant, a 2.0% forward termination fee, a 6.5% regulatory\ntermination fee, and a six month outside date with a possible extension to a nine month outside date if regulatory approvals remained outstanding.\nOn June 10, 2022, the chief executive officer of Company D communicated to Dr. Baker that Company D was interested in engaging in due diligence of\nSeagen with a view to proposing an acquisition at a price of $200 per share. Dr. Baker replied that he did not consider this proposal to be of sufficient\ninterest to Seagen and that, under the circumstances, it would not make sense for Seagen to allow Company D to conduct due diligence with a view to\nproposing an acquisition at that price. Company D did not revert with a revised proposal following this discussion.\nOn June 13, 2022, the day that an updated proposal had been requested by Seagen, a representative of Pfizer indicated to a representative of Centerview\nthat Pfizer would not be submitting an updated proposal.\nOn June 17, 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported that Seagen was in discussions with a global biopharmaceutical company regarding a potential sale of\nSeagen. Further reports on this topic were published in\n \n-38-\nTable of Contents\nthe Wall Street Journal on June 23, 2022, July 6, 2022 and July 15, 2022. The closing trading price of our common stock on June 17, 2022 was $165.45,\nrepresenting an approximately 13% increase from the prior day\u2019s closing. Following the June 17 report, a representative of Pfizer contacted a\nrepresentative of Centerview regarding a reference in the report to a large potential marketing alliance that Seagen was purportedly considering. The\nPfizer representative indicated that Pfizer might be interested in engaging in discussions with Seagen concerning such a marketing alliance.\nLater on June 17, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS.

The directors then discussed the Wall Street Journal article, including the potential impact of the article on Seagen\u2019s\nemployees and on transaction negotiations. The directors also discussed the benefits, risks and practicalities of reaching out proactively to other\npotential bidders, and the consensus of the Board was to continue discussions with Company A.\nOn June 27, 2022, Dr. Baker and Company A\u2019s chief executive officer discussed the potential transaction. Company A\u2019s chief executive officer indicated\nthat, due to the uncertainty regarding the significant components of value, it would be difficult for Company A to agree to a transaction price but that the\nparties should continue finalizing transaction documentation with an intention of finalizing value at a later date.\nOn both June 28, 2022 and July 25, 2022, the Board met and discussed the status of the potential transaction with Company A.

Drs. Baker and Bourla spoke the following day.\nDuring their discussion, Dr. Bourla conveyed Pfizer was now ready to move forward with pursuing an acquisition of Seagen. Dr. Bourla communicated to\nDr. Baker that Pfizer was prepared to conduct diligence and agreement negotiations and could be in a position to propose a transaction price in the $210\nto $220 per share range specified in its June 1, 2022 letter if Pfizer could confirm certain assumptions during its due diligence of Seagen. In this\nconversation, Dr. Bourla also conveyed Pfizer\u2019s interest in retaining Seagen personnel and in maintaining Seagen\u2019s presence in the Seattle area.\nOn February 2, 2023, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS.

Dr. Baker related that following his discussion with Dr.\nBourla, Dr. Baker and Mr. Epstein received preliminary advice from Sullivan & Cromwell concerning a potential acquisition by Pfizer. The directors then\ndiscussed a potential acquisition by Pfizer, including Pfizer\u2019s recent public statements concerning its immediate strategic priorities in the oncology area,\nPfizer\u2019s track record of swiftly executing significant transactions, the need for confidentiality in any discussions with Pfizer in light of the pervasive media\nleaks surrounding discussions with Company A in 2022, and the need to minimize distraction of Seagen\u2019s management from Seagen\u2019s operations and\nstrategy. To contextualize developments in Seagen\u2019s business since Seagen\u2019s discussions with Company A ceased in 2022, Dr. Baker reminded the\ndirectors of elements of the preliminary financial analyses that representatives of Centerview had reviewed with the Board in 2022 in connection with\nSeagen\u2019s discussions with Company A. Mr. Epstein then reviewed with the directors certain developments that had occurred in the intervening period.\nDr. Baker and Mr. Epstein commented on various other global biopharmaceutical companies and their likely strategic interest in and financial wherewithal\nfor entering into discussions to acquire Seagen, and the directors discussed the same.

Mr. Epstein then described the\npositive revenue opportunities represented by Seagen\u2019s marketed products, expansion opportunities and the quality of Seagen\u2019s extensive product\npipeline, including candidates with blockbuster potential. A discussion among directors ensued, in which the directors commented on and discussed\nvarious strategies and tactics for maximizing the transaction price. The directors also discussed the risks to Seagen arising out of an extensive due\ndiligence investigation by Pfizer, including the risk of a media leak or leaks similar to those Seagen experienced in 2022, the potential negative impacts of\nany such leaks, and the heightened risk to employees, management, and investors of repetitive distraction from Seagen\u2019s operations and strategy. The\ndirectors, in consultation with representatives of Centerview and MTS, then discussed perspectives on valuation in light of both internal and external\ndevelopments since 2022. The directors discussed certain non-price transaction terms that they would wish to have substantially agreed prior to granting\nPfizer access to detailed information, including the percentage amount of the regulatory termination fee and the outside date for the transaction. After\ndiscussion, it was the consensus of the Board that Dr. Baker should speak to Dr. Bourla and seek the highest transaction price possible but no less than\nthe upper end of the range to which Dr. Bourla referred, as early an outside date as was achievable, and a large regulatory termination fee.\nOn February 13, 2023, Dr. Baker spoke with Dr. Bourla and related that Seagen would not provide detailed due diligence information to Pfizer unless and\nuntil certain key transaction terms had been substantially agreed, including transaction pricing. Drs. Baker and Bourla then discussed transaction pricing,\nregulatory matters, and human resources matters in connection with a potential acquisition, including retention awards to employees to ensure\nemployees are retained during the pendency of the transaction and following the closing of the transaction. Dr. Baker also conveyed to Dr. Bourla the\npositive financial and operational trends at Seagen.\nLater on February 13, 2023, the Board met, together with representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. Dr. Baker provided the directors\nwith an update concerning his discussion with Dr. Bourla earlier that day. A discussion among the directors ensued, in which various directors discussed\ntheir views on transaction price, and negotiating tactics for maximizing price. Further discussion among the directors ensued concerning the importance\nof a rapid transaction evaluation process, the need to avoid media leaks and the potential negative impacts on Seagen and its operations, strategy and\npersonnel arising from a lengthy process and/or one or more media leaks. Mr. Epstein provided his views concerning the likely impact on Seagen of the\nInflation Reduction Act as well as positive new data generated on several new medicines. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that Dr.\nBaker should reconvene with Dr. Bourla to seek a transaction price in excess of $225 per share and preferably at or near $230 per share, and that if such a\ntransaction price were available, Dr. Baker should seek to negotiate the best possible terms with respect to regulatory and human resources matters.\nOn February 14, 2023, Drs. Baker and Bourla discussed Pfizer\u2019s potential acquisition of Seagen. During these discussions, Dr. Bourla indicated that Pfizer\nwas prepared to move forward at a transaction price toward the high end of the previously indicated range of $210 to $220 per share, and might consider a\nhigher transaction price subject to receipt and confirmation of certain items in diligence. Dr. Baker indicated that Pfizer should offer a price at or near $230\nper share. Dr. Baker also noted to Dr. Bourla that Seagen would need a transaction structure with a 5.5% regulatory termination fee in the event that the\ntransaction did not close for regulatory reasons.\nOn February 15, 2023, Seagen announced financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022 as well as portfolio updates, including\nupdates with respect to Seagen\u2019s clinical pipeline. Seagen delivered total revenue of nearly $2 billion in 2022, reflecting 25% growth compared to 2021,\nwhich was above consensus expectations. Seagen also provided a 2023 financial outlook and announced multiple key milestones anticipated in 2023,\nincluding potential label expansion, key data readouts and additional international launches for current products. The closing trading price of our\ncommon stock on February 16, 2023, the first trading day following the announcement of financial results, was $160.91, representing an approximately\n13.3% increase from the prior trading day\u2019s closing price.\n \n \n-42-\nTable of Contents\nAlso on February 15, 2023, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and\nMTS.\nOn February 17, 2023, Dr. Baker spoke twice with Dr. Bourla. During the first discussion, Dr. Bourla relayed that he expected to have a meeting later in the\nday to review final valuation and would be able to propose a firm transaction price at that time. Drs. Baker and Bourla also discussed Seagen\u2019s year end\nresults and Dr. Bourla asked Dr. Baker a series of questions concerning certain matters, which Dr. Baker answered. Later on February 17, 2023, Dr. Bourla\nconveyed that Pfizer was prepared to move forward with finalizing diligence and documentation for an acquisition of Seagen at a transaction price of\n$228.50 per share in cash, targeting an announcement of the transaction on March 13, 2023. After negotiation with Dr. Baker, Dr. Bourla agreed to an\nincreased transaction price of $229 per share in cash. Drs. Baker and Bourla next discussed regulatory matters, and aligned on a structure with a 5.0%\nregulatory termination fee, an 18-month outside date, a covenant whereby Pfizer would not be required to make regulatory divestitures, but would commit\nto litigate against a government authority seeking to block the transaction on antitrust grounds, and a covenant whereby Pfizer would forbear from\nengaging in transactions that would be reasonably expected to delay completion of the acquisition beyond the outside date. Drs. Baker and Bourla also\naligned on the framework for Seagen retaining and compensating employees to keep the workforce intact. Between February 17 and March 12, 2023, the\ndetailed terms agreed to by the parties with respect to the retention pool were negotiated and finalized by members of senior management of Seagen and\nPfizer, together with representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton. During the discussion, Dr. Baker agreed that Pfizer could proceed with\ndiligence.\nThe Board met twice on February 17, 2023, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and\nMTS, with such respective meetings taking place following Dr. Baker\u2019s respective discussions with Dr. Bourla that day.\nOn February 24, 2023, Pfizer received access to due diligence materials (including access to a virtual data room) and commenced due diligence of detailed\ninformation provided by Seagen, including participating in management meetings and due diligence sessions with Seagen. Between February 24 and\nMarch 12, 2023, representatives of Pfizer engaged in a number of diligence discussions with representatives of Seagen.\nAlso on February 24, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided to representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell a draft of the merger agreement,\nrevised from the version that Sullivan & Cromwell had initially provided to Wachtell Lipton in June 2022, and a draft voting agreement to be entered into\nby Baker Bros. The draft merger agreement reflected the terms discussed by Drs. Baker and Bourla on February 17, 2023, and a 3.9% forward termination\nfee. The draft voting agreement was also distributed to Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP (\u201cAkin\u201d), counsel to Baker Bros.\nOn February 26, 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported that Seagen and Pfizer were discussing a potential acquisition of Seagen by Pfizer. The closing\ntrading price of our common stock on February 27, 2023, the first trading day following this report, was $178.16, representing an approximately 10%\nincrease from the prior trading day\u2019s closing.\nDuring the evening of February 26, 2023, following the Wall Street Journal report, Company A\u2019s head of business development contacted a\nrepresentative of Centerview seeking additional information about the speculation reflected in the Wall Street Journal report. During the morning of\nFebruary 27, 2023, after updating Dr. Baker on this development, the representative of Centerview spoke with Company A\u2019s head of business\ndevelopment. The Centerview representative indicated that neither Centerview nor Seagen would comment on market rumors. During this discussion,\nCompany A\u2019s head of business development said that he did not believe Company A\u2019s position had changed from September 2022 that Company A was\nnot interested in discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Seagen. Thereafter, Company A did not communicate further with Seagen regarding a\npotential acquisition of Seagen.\nOn February 27, 2023, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton discussed open points in the merger agreement, including deal\ncertainty and deal protection provisions, including the amount of the forward\n \n-43-\nTable of Contents\ntermination fee. Later that day, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell provided revised drafts of the merger agreement and voting agreement to\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton, the latter of which reflected input from Akin. The revised draft merger agreement noted that the amount of the forward\ntermination fee remained an open point. On February 28, 2023, Centerview provided its written relationships disclosure to Seagen. On March 1, 2023, MTS\nprovided its written relationships disclosure to Seagen.\nOn March 2, 2023, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton continued to discuss open points in the merger agreement.\nOn March 3, 2023, the Board met, together with members of senior management, Seagen\u2019s internal finance team and representatives of Sullivan &\nCromwell, Centerview and MTS. Seagen\u2019s chief financial officer reviewed with the directors Seagen\u2019s financial position and the Seagen Projections. After\ndiscussion, the Seagen Projections were approved by the Board, and the Board instructed Centerview to use the Seagen Projections in connection with\nCenterview\u2019s financial analyses. Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell also reviewed with the directors the open points on the merger agreement and\nreceived guidance and direction from the directors. The directors also discussed the Wall Street Journal leak that occurred the prior week, and recognized\nthe importance of a rapid transaction exploration process given the potential negative impacts on Seagen, its operations and employees of any such\nleaks. After Centerview and MTS departed the meeting, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties.\nRepresentatives of Sullivan & Cromwell then reviewed with the directors the written relationships disclosures provided to the Board by Centerview and\nMTS prior to the meeting\u037e following this review, no director expressed concern regarding the ability of Centerview and MTS to continue to provide\nindependent financial advice to the Board.\nAlso on March 3, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided to representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell a revised draft of the merger agreement\nand a revised draft of the voting agreement.\nBetween March 5, 2023 and March 12, 2023, representatives of Seagen, Pfizer, Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton had a number of discussions\nconcerning the open points on the merger agreement.\nOn March 8, 2023, the Board met, together with representatives of senior management, Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. Representatives of\nCenterview reviewed various preliminary financial analyses based on the Seagen Projections reviewed and approved by the Board on March 3.\nRepresentatives of Sullivan & Cromwell reviewed the open points on the merger agreement and received guidance and direction from the directors.\nOn March 10, 2023, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton exchanged drafts of the merger agreement, and representatives of Akin\nprovided a revised draft of the voting agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton.\nOn March 11, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided a revised draft of the voting agreement to representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and\nAkin, the form of which was acceptable to all parties thereto.\nAlso on March 11, 2023, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS.\nDuring the meeting, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell also reviewed the remaining open points in the merger agreement and received guidance and\ndirection.\nThroughout March 11, 2023 and into the morning of March 12, 2023, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton exchanged drafts of the\nmerger agreement and participated in various calls to discuss the open points on the merger agreement. On certain of these calls, representatives of\nSullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton were joined by representatives of Seagen and Pfizer. The parties ultimately aligned on a forward termination fee\nof $1,646 million (or approximately 3.7% of equity transaction value).\nOn the morning of March 12, 2023, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview\nand MTS. Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell\n \n-44-\nTable of Contents\nreviewed with the directors the proposed resolution of the open points of the merger agreement. Representatives of Centerview then reviewed with the\nBoard Centerview\u2019s financial analysis of the merger consideration, and rendered to the Board Centerview\u2019s oral opinion, which was subsequently\nconfirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 12, 2023, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the\nmerger consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Centerview\u2019s opinion, please see below under the caption \u201c \u2014Opinion of\nSeagen\u2019s Financial Advisor.\u201d After careful consideration, the Board, by resolutions unanimously adopted by the Board then: (i) determined that the\nmerger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Seagen and its stockholders\u037e (ii) approved\nand declared it advisable to enter into the merger agreement and the voting agreement\u037e (iii) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be\nsubmitted to a vote of the Seagen stockholders at the special meeting\u037e and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, resolved to\nmake the company board recommendation. The merger agreement and voting agreement were executed later that day.\nOn the morning of March 13, 2023, prior to the opening of trading on Nasdaq, Seagen and Pfizer issued a joint press release announcing the execution of\nthe merger agreement.\nRecommendation of the Board of Directors\u037e Reasons for the Merger\nAfter careful consideration, at a meeting held on March 12, 2023, the Board, by resolutions unanimously adopted by the Board: (i) determined that the\nmerger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Seagen and Seagen stockholders\u037e (ii)\napproved and declared it advisable to enter into the merger agreement and the voting agreement\u037e (iii) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement\nbe submitted to a vote of Seagen stockholders at the special meeting\u037e and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, resolved to\nmake the company board recommendation.\nOur stockholders must approve the merger agreement proposal in order for the merger to occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A\nto this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully and in its entirety.\nThe vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger agreement proposal. Accordingly, a stockholder may\nvote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the\ncompensation proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on Seagen, Pfizer or Merger Sub. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted\nby our stockholders in accordance with the requisite company vote and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to\nSeagen\u2019s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of their respective compensation agreements and arrangements\neven if the stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that the Seagen stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the above proposals.\nIn evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, the Board consulted with the senior management of\nSeagen, its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following non-exhaustive list of material\nreasons (which are not listed in order of relative importance) that the Board believes support its unanimous determination and recommendation:\n \n\u2022\nthe likelihood of realizing a compelling, immediate and certain value of $229.00 per share in cash pursuant to the merger as compared to the\nuncertain prospect that the market price of our common stock would reach $229.00 in the foreseeable future, if ever, due to clinical,\nregulatory, commercialization and other business risks, including the risk that one or more of disitamab vedotin, ladiratuzumab vedotin,\nSGN-B6A and Seagen\u2019s other product candidates do not obtain regulatory approval or market acceptance\u037e\n \n-45-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nrecent and historical market prices for our common stock, as compared to the merger consideration, including the fact that the merger\nconsideration of $229.00 per share represents an approximate premium of:\n \n\u2022\n42% to the $161.37 closing price per share of our common stock on February 24, 2023, the last trading day prior to the first media\naccounts speculating about a possible acquisition of Seagen by Pfizer\u037e\n \n\u2022\n54% to the $148.42 price per share of our common stock based on the volume weighted average price per share of common stock for\nthe 30-trading day period ended February 24, 2023\u037e and\n \n\u2022\n33% to the $172.61 closing price per share of our common stock on March 10, 2023, the last trading day before public announcement\nof the merger agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe oral opinion of Centerview rendered to the Board on March 12, 2023, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion\ndated such date that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration\nto be paid to the holders of shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Centerview\u2019s opinion, please see below in \u201c\u2014Opinion of Centerview\nPartners LLC.\u201d The written opinion delivered by Centerview is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe course and history of the negotiations between Seagen and Pfizer, including the Board\u2019s belief that these negotiations yielded Pfizer\u2019s\nbest offer, and the enhancements to the merger agreement that Seagen was able to obtain as a result of these negotiations, as described\nunder \u201c\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that Seagen had held robust, extensive discussions with Company A in 2020 and 2022 and that such discussions did not yield a firm\noffer equivalent or superior to the merger consideration\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief, following discussion with senior management and representatives of Seagen\u2019s financial advisors, and after considering\nSeagen\u2019s prior discussions with Company A and preliminary discussions with Company D, that it was unlikely that any other potential\nacquirors, including financial sponsors and strategic buyers, would be willing and able to acquire Seagen at a price in excess of $229.00 per\nshare in cash, even if Seagen were to conduct an auction process or other solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that there were media reports that Pfizer was in talks to acquire Seagen, and, in 2022, there were extensive media reports that another\nglobal biopharmaceutical company was in talks to acquire Seagen, which provided any third party wishing to engage in discussions with\nSeagen multiple opportunities to make its interest known\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that, although the Board had not granted Pfizer exclusivity and was free to consider indications of interest from any other party, no\npotential acquiror other than Pfizer made a proposal to acquire Seagen during the period between the initial media reports of Pfizer\u2019s interest\non February 26, 2023 and the public announcement of the merger agreement on March 13, 2023, and the Board\u2019s view that, if potential\nacquirors were interested in exploring a transaction with Seagen, such potential acquirors could have engaged with the Board or its\nrepresentatives before such public announcement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe anticipated timing of the consummation of merger, including the likelihood of consummation, based upon the scope of the conditions to\nthe consummation of the merger including the definition of \u201cmaterial adverse effect,\u201d the terms of the voting agreement, the relative\nlikelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, the remedies available to Seagen under the merger agreement in the event of various\nbreaches by Pfizer, including specific performance, and Pfizer\u2019s business reputation in the biopharmaceutical industry, its financial capacity\nto complete an acquisition of this size and its track record of successfully completing acquisitions of other businesses\u037e\n \n-46-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe fact that Pfizer agreed to pay to Seagen a reverse termination fee of $2,224 million if the merger is not consummated by reason of failure\nto obtain approval under antitrust or foreign direct investment laws under the circumstances described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the termination fee and other limitations applicable to, among other things, an adverse recommendation change and\nacquisition proposals agreed to in the merger agreement (as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation\u037e\nAdverse Recommendation Changes\u201d) were reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable potential\nacquirer from submitting an unsolicited proposal to acquire Seagen following the announcement of the merger agreement or prohibit the\nBoard or its representatives from engaging with any such potential acquiror in such a circumstance, subject to the applicable provisions of\nthe merger agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s review of the structure of the merger and the financial and other terms of the merger agreement, including, among others, the\nfollowing terms of the merger agreement:\n \n\u2022\nthe conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, which the Board believed are reasonable and customary in number and\nscope\u037e\n \n\u2022\nrepresentations from Pfizer and Merger Sub that they will have all funds necessary to pay the amounts required to be paid by them,\npursuant to the merger agreement, and the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Seagen in the merger agreement\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe state of the U.S. and global economies, increased market volatility, U.S. and global inflation trends and the increasing interest rate\nenvironment to combat inflation, the potential for a recession, the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory changes\nincluding the Inflation Reduction Act, and the current and potential impact in both the near term and long term on the biopharmaceutical\nindustry and Seagen of these trends and developments.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Board, in consultation with senior management of Seagen, its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, also\nconsidered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the merger agreement and the merger, including the following factors (which\nare not listed in order of relative importance):\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that Seagen will no longer exist as a standalone public company and Seagen\u2019s stockholders will forgo participation in any future\nincrease in Seagen\u2019s value that might result from our earnings or possible growth as a standalone public company, including if each of\ndisitamab vedotin, ladiratuzumab vedotin, SGN-B6A and Seagen\u2019s other pipeline product candidates prove successful in clinical trials and\nobtain regulatory approval and market acceptance\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe covenants in the merger agreement that preclude Seagen from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals (although Seagen is able to\nprovide information in response to unsolicited acquisition proposals, as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No\nSolicitation\u037e Adverse Recommendation Changes\u201d) and provide Pfizer with customary \u201cmatching\u201d rights prior to Seagen terminating the\nmerger agreement to accept a superior proposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe possibility that the voting agreement may serve to deter potentially interested parties from submitting an alternative acquisition\nproposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that Seagen would be obligated to pay the termination fee of $1,646 million in cash under certain circumstances, including the\npotential impact of such termination fee on the willingness of other potential acquirors to propose alternative transactions, although the\nBoard believed that the termination fee was reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable\n \n-47-\nTable of Contents\npotential acquiror from submitting a proposal to acquire Seagen following the announcement of the merger agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe effect of the public announcement of the merger agreement on Seagen\u2019s operations and employees, as well as Seagen\u2019s ability to attract\nand retain key personnel while the merger is pending\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that Pfizer\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligation to consummate the merger are subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, and\nthe possibility that such conditions may not be satisfied on a timely basis or at all, including as a result of events outside of Seagen\u2019s\ncontrol, and the fact that, if the merger is not consummated:\n \n\u2022\nSeagen\u2019s directors, officers and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant\ndistractions from their work during the pendency of the merger, and Seagen will have incurred significant transaction costs attempting\nto consummate the merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s perception of Seagen\u2019s continuing business could potentially result in a loss of customers, suppliers, distributors,\nbusiness partners, collaboration partners and employees\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Seagen must refrain from a number of actions related to the conduct of its business\nwithout first obtaining Pfizer\u2019s written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the possibility these terms\nmay limit the ability of Seagen to pursue business opportunities that it would otherwise pursue, including potential acquisitions,\ninvestments, licenses and other strategic opportunities\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that certain of Seagen\u2019s directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different from, and in addition to, those\nof Seagen\u2019s other stockholders, as described in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Interests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger\u201d\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that Seagen has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection with the proposed\ntransaction, regardless of whether the merger is consummated\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe potential for litigation by stockholders in connection with the merger, which, even where lacking in merit, could nonetheless result in\ndistraction and expense\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that receipt of the merger consideration generally would be taxable to Seagen\u2019s stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and reasons considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material reasons\nconsidered by the Board. In view of the variety of reasons considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement, the Board did not find it\npracticable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons considered in reaching its determination and\nrecommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different reasons. The Board did not undertake to make any\nspecific determination as to whether any reason, or any particular aspect of any reason, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The\nBoard based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented. After considering these reasons, the Board concluded that the positive\nreasons related to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, substantially outweighed the potential negative\nreasons.\nPortions of this explanation of the reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore,\nshould be read in light of the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d",

In addition, Centerview reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for Seagen and compared\nthat data with similar data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that Centerview deemed relevant.\nCenterview also compared certain of the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other\ntransactions that Centerview deemed relevant, and conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as\nCenterview deemed appropriate.\n \n-49-\nTable of Contents\nCenterview assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal, regulatory,\ntax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by Centerview for purposes of its opinion and, with Seagen\u2019s consent,\nCenterview relied upon such information as being complete and accurate. In that regard, Centerview assumed, at Seagen\u2019s direction, that the internal data\n(including, without limitation, the forecasts) were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the\nmanagement of Seagen as to the matters covered thereby and Centerview relied, at Seagen\u2019s direction, on the internal data for purposes of Centerview\u2019s\nanalysis and opinion.

Centerview also\nassumed, at Seagen\u2019s direction, that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with all applicable\nlaws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or the waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the\neffect of which would be material to Centerview\u2019s analysis or Centerview\u2019s opinion and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental,\nregulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, no\ndelay, limitation, restriction, condition or other change will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to Centerview\u2019s analysis or Centerview\u2019s\nopinion.

Centerview\u2019s financial advisory services and its written opinion were\nprovided for the information and assistance of the Board (in the directors\u2019 capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for\npurposes of its consideration of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The issuance of Centerview\u2019s opinion was\napproved by the Centerview Partners LLC Fairness Opinion Committee.\nSummary of Centerview Financial Analysis\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the Board in connection with Centerview\u2019s opinion, dated\nMarch 12, 2023. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by,\nand underlying the opinion of, Centerview, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to\nthose financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so the\nreference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized below should not be taken to be Centerview\u2019s view of the actual\nvalue of Seagen. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully\nunderstand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete\ndescription of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the tables below without considering all financial analyses or\nfactors or the full narrative description of such analyses or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors,\ncould create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview\u2019s financial analyses and its opinion. In performing its analyses,\nCenterview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of\nwhich are beyond the control of Seagen or any other parties to the merger. None of Seagen, Pfizer, Merger Sub or Centerview or any other person\nassumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily\nindicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition,\nanalyses relating to the value of Seagen do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which Seagen may actually be sold. Accordingly, the\nassumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. Except as\notherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before\nMarch 10, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger) and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nSelected Public Company Analysis\nCenterview reviewed and analyzed certain financial information of Seagen and compared it to corresponding financial information of certain publicly-\ntraded, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies (which companies are referred to as the \u201cselected companies\u201d in this summary of Centerview\u2019s\nopinion) that Centerview, based on its experience and professional judgment, deemed relevant to consider in relation to Seagen. Although none of the\nselected companies is identical or directly comparable to Seagen, the selected companies were selected by Centerview because, among other reasons,\nthey are publicly-traded, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies with certain business, operational and/or financial characteristics that, for\npurposes of Centerview\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to those of Seagen.\nHowever, because none of the selected companies is exactly the same as Seagen, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not,\nrely solely on the quantitative results of the selected public company analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its\nexperience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the business, operational and/or financial characteristics and other factors that\ncould affect the public trading values of the selected companies and Seagen in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the\nquantitative analysis.\n \n-51-\nTable of Contents\nUsing publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of March 10, 2023, Centerview calculated, for each selected\ncompany, such company\u2019s enterprise value (calculated as the equity value (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account\noutstanding in-the-money options, warrants, restricted stock units, performance stock units and other convertible securities) plus the book value of debt\nand certain liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of Wall Street research analyst consensus estimated revenue for calendar year 2026\n(\u201cEV/2026E Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nThe selected companies are summarized below:\n \nSelected Company\nEV/2026E\nRevenue\nMultiple\nAlnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n6.5x\nBiogen Inc.\n3.7x\nBioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.\n4.3x\nGenmab A/S\n5.4x\nIncyte Corporation\n2.5x\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n5.3x\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n5.6x\nMedian:\n5.3x\nBased on this analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and experience, related to, among other\nthings, differences in the business, operational and/or financial conditions and prospects of Seagen and the companies included in the selected public\ncompany analysis, Centerview selected a reference range of EV/2026E Revenue Multiples of 4.5x to 5.5x. Centerview applied this reference range of\nEV/2026E Revenue Multiples to Seagen\u2019s estimated calendar year risk-adjusted 2026 revenue of $4.371 billion as set forth in the forecasts and added to it\nSeagen\u2019s estimated net cash, as of June 30, 2023, of $1.334 billion, provided by the management of Seagen as set forth in the internal data, and divided the\nresults of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of our common stock (determined using the treasury stock method\nand taking into account outstanding in-the-money options, long-term incentive plans, restricted stock units, and performance stock units (including\nassumptions regarding the vesting of such performance stock units)) based on information provided by the management of Seagen as set forth in the\ninternal data. This analysis resulted in an implied per share equity value range for shares of our common stock of approximately $109.15 to $131.70,\nrounded to the nearest $0.05. Centerview then compared this range to the merger consideration of $229.00 per share of our common stock to be paid to\nthe holders of shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement.\nSelected Precedent Transaction Analysis\nCenterview reviewed and analyzed certain financial information of Seagen and compared it to corresponding financial information of certain transactions\nlisted below involving commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies (which transactions are referred to as the \u201cselected transactions\u201d in this summary\nof Centerview\u2019s opinion) that Centerview, based on its experience and professional judgment, deemed relevant to consider in relation to Seagen and the\nmerger. Although none of the selected transactions is identical or directly comparable to the merger, the companies included in the selected transactions\nwere selected by Centerview because, among other reasons, they are commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies with certain business, operational\nand/or financial characteristics that, for purposes of Centerview\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the merger.\nHowever, because none of the selected transactions is exactly the same as the merger, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did\nnot, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected precedent transactions analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments,\nbased on its experience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the business, operational and/or financial characteristics and other\nfactors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the target companies in the selected transactions and Seagen in order to provide\na context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.\n \n-52-\nTable of Contents\nUsing publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of the time of the announcement of the selected transactions,\nCenterview calculated, for each selected transaction, the transaction value (calculated as the offer value (determined using the treasury stock method and\ntaking into account outstanding in-the-money options, warrants, restricted stock units, performance stock units and other convertible securities), plus\nthe book value of debt and certain liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and excluding any contingent consideration) implied for each target company\nbased on the consideration payable in the applicable selected transaction) as a multiple of the target company\u2019s Wall Street research analyst consensus\nestimated three-year forward revenue at the time of the transaction announcement (\u201cThree-Year Forward Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nThe selected transactions considered in this analysis are summarized below:\n \nDate Announced\nTarget\nAcquiror\nTransaction\nValue / 3\n-Year\nForward\nRevenue\nMultiple\nDecember 12, 2022\nHorizon Therapeutics Public Limited\nCompany\nAmgen Inc.\n5.6x\nDecember 12, 2020\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAstraZeneca PLC\n5.1x\nSeptember 13, 2020\nImmunomedics, Inc.\nGilead Sciences, Inc.\n21.4x\nJune 25, 2019\nAllergan plc\nAbbVie Inc.\n5.1x\nJanuary 3, 2019\nCelgene Corporation\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company\n4.1x\nMay 7, 2018\nShire plc\nTakeda Pharmaceutical Company\nLimited\n5.2x\nJanuary 25, 2017\nActelion Ltd.\nJohnson & Johnson\n9.6x\nJanuary 11, 2016\nBaxalta Incorporated\nShire plc\n4.6x\nMarch 4, 2015\nPharmacyclics, Inc.\nAbbVie Inc.\n9.3x\nFebruary 16, 2011\nGenzyme Corporation\nSanofi-Aventis\n3.3x\nMedian:\n5.2x\nBased on this analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its experience and professional judgment, related to, among other\nthings, differences in the business, operational and/or financial conditions and prospects of Seagen and the companies included in the selected\ntransactions analysis, Centerview selected a reference range of Three-Year Forward Revenue Multiples of 5.0x to 9.5x derived from the selected\ntransactions. Centerview applied this reference range of Three-Year Forward Revenue Multiples to Seagen\u2019s estimated three-year forward revenue based\non the internal data of $4.016 billion, added to it Seagen\u2019s estimated net cash as of June 30, 2023 of $1.334 billion, and divided the result of the foregoing\ncalculations by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of our common stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account\noutstanding in-the-money options, long-term incentive plans, restricted stock units, and performance stock units (including assumptions regarding the\nvesting of such performance stock units)) based on information provided by the management of Seagen as set forth in the internal data. This analysis\nresulted in an implied per share equity value range for shares of our common stock of approximately $111.15 to $203.65, rounded to the nearest $0.05.\nCenterview then compared this range to the merger consideration of $229.00 per share of our common stock to be paid to the holders of shares of our\ncommon stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nCenterview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Seagen based on the forecasts. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation\nmethodology used to derive a valuation of an asset or set of assets by calculating the \u201cpresent value\u201d of estimated future cash flows of the asset or set\nof assets. \u201cPresent value\u201d refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts\nby a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other\nappropriate factors.\n \n-53-\nTable of Contents\nIn performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range of equity values for shares of our common stock by (a) discounting to present value, as of\nJune 30, 2023, using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 9.5% (reflecting Centerview\u2019s analysis of Seagen\u2019s weighted average cost of capital) and using a\nmid-year convention: (i) the forecasted risk-adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows of Seagen over the period beginning on July 1, 2023 and ending\non December 31, 2034, utilized by Centerview based on the forecasts, (ii) a range of implied terminal values of Seagen, calculated by Centerview using a\nreference range of price-to-earnings multiples of 16x to 20x (which range was selected by Centerview using its experience and professional judgment) and\napplying this reference range of price-to-earnings multiples to Seagen\u2019s estimated calendar year risk-adjusted 2034 net income, based on information\nprovided by the management of Seagen, as of March 10, 2023, and set forth in the internal data and (iii) tax savings from usage of Seagen\u2019s federal net\noperating losses of $682 million, as of December 31, 2022, and Seagen\u2019s future losses and (b) adding to the foregoing results Seagen\u2019s estimated net cash,\nas of June 30, 2023, of $1.334 billion, which amount was provided by the management of Seagen as set forth in the internal data. Centerview divided the\nresult of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of our common stock (determined using the treasury stock method\nand taking into account outstanding in-the-money options, long-term incentive plans, restricted stock units, and performance stock units (including\nassumptions regarding the vesting of such performance stock units)), based on information provided by the management of Seagen as set forth in the\ninternal data. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of our common stock of $179.40 to $231.80, rounded to the nearest $0.05.\nCenterview then compared this range to the merger consideration of $229.00 per share of our common stock to be paid to the holders of shares of our\ncommon stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement.\nOther Factors\nCenterview noted for the Board certain additional factors solely for reference and informational purposes only, including, among other things, the\nfollowing:\n \n\u2022\nHistorical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed historical closing trading prices of shares of our common stock during the\n52-week period ended March 10, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger), which reflected low and high\nstock closing prices for Seagen during such period of $108.81 to $181.29 per share of our common stock, and the closing trading price of\nshares of our common stock on February 24, 2023 (the last trading day prior to the date on which the trading price of our common stock was\nperceived by Centerview to be affected by a potential transaction) of $161.37 per share of our common stock.\n \n\u2022\nAnalyst Price Targets Analysis. Centerview reviewed stock price targets for shares of our common stock in publicly available Wall Street\nresearch analyst reports as of March 10, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger) which indicated low and\nhigh stock price targets for Seagen ranging from $141.00 to $215.00 per share of our common stock.\n \n\u2022\nPrecedent Premiums Paid Analysis. Centerview performed an analysis of premiums paid in the selected transactions involving publicly-\ntraded, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies, as set forth above in \u201cSelected Precedent Transaction Analysis.\u201d The premiums in\nthis analysis were calculated by comparing the per share acquisition price in each transaction to the closing price of the target company\u2019s\ncommon stock for the date one day prior to the date on which the trading price of the target\u2019s common stock was perceived by Centerview\nto be affected by a potential transaction. Based on the analysis above and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its\nprofessional judgment, Centerview applied a range of 40% to 60% to Seagen\u2019s closing stock price on February 24, 2023 (the last trading day\nprior to the date on which the trading price of our common stock was perceived by Centerview to be affected by a potential transaction) of\n$161.37, which resulted in an implied price range of approximately $225.90 to $258.20 per share of our common stock, rounded to the nearest\n$0.05.\n \n-54-\nTable of Contents\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods\nof financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to\nsummary description. In arriving at its opinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis that it\nconsidered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results\nof all of the analyses.\nCenterview\u2019s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in its evaluation of the merger and the\nother transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the\nviews of the Board or management of Seagen with respect to the merger consideration or as to whether the Board would have been willing to determine\nthat a different consideration was fair. The consideration for the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement was determined\nthrough arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Seagen and Pfizer and was approved by the Board. Centerview provided advice to Seagen during these\nnegotiations. Centerview did not, however recommend any specific amount of consideration to Seagen or the Board or that any specific amount of\nconsideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nCenterview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory and\nmerchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, except for Centerview\u2019s current engagement, Centerview had not\nbeen engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Seagen, and did not receive any compensation from Seagen during such period. In the\ntwo years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview had been engaged to provide and was providing, as of the date of its written opinion,\nfinancial advisory services unrelated to Seagen to Pfizer, for which Centerview has received compensation and for which Centerview expects to receive\nadditional compensation, including in connection with Pfizer\u2019s acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2022 and certain other strategic matters.\nCenterview has received between $30 million and $40 million in aggregate compensation from Pfizer for work performed during such period, including\nexpected fees for work currently being performed. Centerview may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to Seagen or Pfizer or\ntheir respective affiliates in the future, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 directors, officers,\nmembers and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview\u2019s affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other\npersons in which any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt,\nequity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, Seagen, Pfizer, or any of\ntheir respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nThe Board selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the merger based on Centerview\u2019s reputation, experience and knowledge of the\nbiopharmaceutical industry. Centerview is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to\nthe merger.\nIn connection with Centerview\u2019s services as the financial advisor to the Board, Seagen has agreed to pay Centerview an aggregate fee of approximately\n$88 million, $8.5 million of which was payable upon execution of the merger agreement and will be paid on December 1, 2023, and the remainder of which is\npayable contingent upon consummation of the merger. In addition, Seagen has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview\u2019s expenses arising, and to\nindemnify Centerview against certain liabilities that may arise out of Centerview\u2019s engagement.\nCertain Unaudited Financial Information",

However, in\nconnection with the Board\u2019s evaluation of the merger, Seagen\u2019s management independently prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information\nfor fiscal years 2023 through 2034, which we refer to generally as the \u201cSeagen Projections.\u201d The Seagen Projections were made available to the Board in\nconnection with their consideration and evaluation of the merger and were provided to Centerview in connection with the rendering of Centerview\u2019s\nfairness opinion to the Board and in performing its related financial analyses, as described above in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014\nOpinion of Centerview Partners LLC\u201d beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement. Additionally, a portion of the Seagen Projections reflecting estimated\nnet revenue for fiscal year 2023 and operating expenses for fiscal years 2023 through 2025 were provided to Pfizer in connection with its evaluation of\nSeagen.\nSeagen is including a summary of the Seagen Projections in this proxy statement in order to provide Seagen stockholders with access to the projections\nthat were made available to, and approved by, the Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and made available to Centerview, and which\nCenterview was instructed by the Board to use, in connection with its financial analyses and opinion.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Seagen Projections:\n \nFiscal Year ending December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\n2028E\n2029E\n2030E\n2031E\n2032E\n2033E\n2034E\nNet Revenue\n$ 2,306\n$ 2,979\n$ 3,661\n$ 4,371\n$5,481 $7,025 $8,802 $9,970 $10,976 $12,094 $11,574 $10,982\nGross Profit(1)\n$ 1,797\n$ 2,217\n$ 2,665\n$ 3,162\n$4,030 $5,320 $6,838 $7,829 $ 8,722 $ 9,713 $ 9,662 $ 9,453\nEBIT(2)\n($\n595) ($\n467) ($\n378) $\n87\n$\n740 $2,025 $3,446 $4,304 $ 4,977 $ 5,737 $ 5,680 $ 5,450\nNet Income(3)\n($\n581) ($\n459) ($\n374) $\n91\n$\n750 $1,857 $2,651 $3,324 $ 3,863 $ 4,473 $ 4,465 $ 4,327\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(4)\n($1,085) ($\n643) ($\n551) ($\n140) $\n373 $1,063 $1,989 $2,798 $ 3,438 $ 4,035 $ 4,336 $ 4,289\n \n(1)\n\u201cGross Profit\u201d means Net Revenue less cost of sales (which includes manufacturing and distribution costs of products sold, profit shares, and outbound royalties).\n(2)\nNon-GAAP financial measure. \u201cEBIT\u201d means earnings before interest and taxes, and refers to Gross Profit less operating expenses, including research and development,\nsales and marketing and general and administrative expenses.\n(3)\nAssumes a tax rate of 24% and includes the impact of net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) usage.\n(4)\nNon-GAAP financial measure.

            "text": "Additional Information About the Seagen Projections\nThe inclusion of the Seagen Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that Seagen or any of its affiliates, advisors or\nrepresentatives (including Centerview) have considered the Seagen Projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the Seagen Projections\nshould not be relied upon as such. This summary of the Seagen Projections is not being included in this proxy statement to influence your decision\nwhether to vote in favor of any proposal. Seagen advises the recipients of the Seagen Projections that its internal financial forecasts upon which the\nSeagen Projections were based are subjective in many respects.\nAlthough presented with numerical specificity, the Seagen Projections were based on numerous variables, assumptions and estimates as to future events\nmade by Seagen\u2019s management that Seagen\u2019s management believed were reasonable at the time the Seagen Projections were prepared, taking into\naccount the relevant information available to management at the time. These variables, assumptions and estimates are inherently\n \n-56-Table of Contents\nuncertain and many are beyond the control of Seagen. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Seagen Projections to not be\nachieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the business of Seagen (including its ability to achieve strategic goals,\nobjectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, the probability of technical and regulatory success, the regulatory and competitive\nenvironment, changes in technology, general business and economic conditions and other risk factors referenced in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Various assumptions underlying the Seagen Projections may not prove to have\nbeen, or may no longer be, accurate. The Seagen Projections may not be realized, and actual results may be significantly higher or lower than projected in\nthe Seagen Projections. The Seagen Projections summarized above do not account for the effects of the merger. The Seagen Projections also reflect\nassumptions as to certain business strategies or plans that are subject to change. The Seagen Projections do not take into account any circumstances or\nevents occurring after the date they were prepared. The Seagen Projections cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less\npredictive with each successive year. As a result, the inclusion of the Seagen Projections in this proxy statement should not be relied on as necessarily\npredictive of actual future events, and actual results may differ materially (and will differ materially if the merger and the other transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement are completed) from the Seagen Projections. For all of these reasons, the internal financial Seagen Projections, and the\nassumptions upon which they are based, are (i) not guarantees of future results\u037e (ii) inherently speculative\u037e and (iii) subject to a number of risks and\nuncertainties. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Seagen Projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that\nthe Seagen Projections will be realized.\nThe Seagen Projections were prepared solely for internal use and to assist the Board with its consideration and evaluation of the merger, and Centerview\nwith its financial analyses and opinion, and although they were prepared on an accounting basis consistent with Seagen\u2019s financial statements, they were\nnot prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the\nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The Seagen Projections\nincluded in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Seagen. Neither Seagen\u2019s independent auditor nor any other\nindependent accountant has compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Seagen Projections, nor have they expressed any\nopinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.\nThe EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow figures contained in the Seagen Projections are \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures,\u201d which are financial\nperformance measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The non-GAAP financial measures\nused in the Seagen Projections were relied upon by Centerview at the instruction of the Board for purposes of its opinion and by the Board in connection\nwith their evaluation of the merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial\nmeasure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the merger if the\ndisclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by\nCenterview for purposes of its opinion or by the Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger. Accordingly, Seagen has not provided a\nreconciliation of the financial measures included in the Seagen Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial\nmeasures as used by Seagen may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in\nnon-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these\nnon-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFor these reasons, as well as the basis and assumptions on which the Seagen Projections were compiled, the inclusion of specific portions of the Seagen\nProjections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that such Seagen Projections will be an accurate prediction of future events,\nand they should not be\n \n-57-\nTable of Contents\nrelied on as such. None of Seagen or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including Centerview) can give you any\nassurance that actual results will not differ from these Seagen Projections. Except as required by applicable law, none of Seagen or any of its affiliates,\nadvisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including Centerview) undertake any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the\nSeagen Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Seagen Projections were generated or to reflect\nthe occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error. Therefore, readers of the this proxy\nstatement are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the portions of the Seagen Projections set forth above. None of Seagen or any of its\naffiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including Centerview) intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to\nthese Seagen Projections. In addition, none of Seagen or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including\nCenterview) have made, make, or are authorized in the future to make, any representation to any stockholder or other person regarding Seagen\u2019s ultimate\nperformance compared to the information contained in the Seagen Projections or that projected results will be achieved, and any statements to the\ncontrary should be disregarded.\nInterests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger",

The Board was aware\nof these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and in making their recommendation that Seagen\nstockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement.\nFor purposes of this disclosure, we have included the named executive officers of Seagen for Seagen\u2019s most recent proxy statement, which was for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2021, as well as the executive officers who we expect to be our named executive officers for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 (which we refer to together as the \u201cNEOs\u201d):\n \n\u2022\nDavid R.

The treatment of Seagen equity awards and\ncertain other compensation arrangements in connection with the merger is provided in the merger agreement and is detailed below.\nTreatment of Seagen Equity Awards\nSeagen Options\nAt the effective time, each Seagen Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not then vested, will be cancelled\nand converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share\nexercise price of such Seagen\n \n-58-Table of Contents\nOption, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen Option (which number, in the case of Seagen Options\nsubject to performance goals based on stock price hurdles, will be determined based on actual performance in accordance with the terms of such Seagen\nOptions, with any Seagen Options that do not vest being forfeited for no consideration), net of applicable taxes and without interest.\nRestricted Stock Units\nAt the effective time, each Seagen RSU, other than any post-signing Seagen RSU, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time,\nwhether or not then vested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the merger\nconsideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen RSU, net of applicable taxes and without interest.\nEach post-signing Seagen RSU will be substituted automatically with a Pfizer cash award with respect to an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the\nmerger consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such post-signing Seagen RSU. Each Pfizer cash award\nwill otherwise be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions applicable to such post-signing Seagen RSU as of immediately prior to the\neffective time. For Seagen RSUs granted in connection with Seagen\u2019s annual grants in August 2023, one-third of the outstanding amount of such awards\nwill vest immediately prior to the effective time, and the remaining portion of the award will vest in equal installments on the first two annual anniversaries\nof closing, or upon an earlier termination without \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in Seagen\u2019s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan), due to death,\ndisability, or for good reason.\nAnnual Performance-based Share Units\nAt the effective time, each Seagen non-products PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not then vested, will be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of\nshares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen non-products PSU based on (a) for performance periods that are complete as of the effective\ntime, actual performance, and (b) for performance periods that are incomplete as of the effective time, the greater of the target and actual performance, net\nof applicable taxes and without interest.\nProducts Performance-based Share Units\nAt the effective time, each Seagen products PSU that is unearned and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be substituted with a Pfizer\nperformance cash award with respect to that number of shares of Pfizer common stock that is equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration,\nmultiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen products PSU. Each Pfizer performance cash award will\notherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such Seagen products PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time\u037e provided,\nthat upon a termination without \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in Seagen\u2019s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan), due to death or disability, or for\ngood reason, the service conditions that such Pfizer performance cash award is subject to will be waived, and the award will vest in full upon the\nachievement of performance conditions (and will be forfeited if such performance conditions are not achieved).\nFor an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Seagen\u2019s NEOs (which includes each of Seagen\u2019s current executive officers) on\nsettlement of their unvested Seagen equity awards, see the section entitled \u201c\u2014Interests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014\nGolden Parachute Compensation\u201d beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement. The estimated aggregate amount that would be realized by the eight\nnon-employee directors of Seagen in respect of their unvested Seagen equity awards as of April 7, 2023, on a \u201csingle-trigger\u201d basis, is $5,462,587.\nStock Ownership\nThe independent chair of the Board, Felix J. Baker, Ph.D., and entities affiliated with Dr. Baker, are together our largest stockholders. For additional\ninformation, see the section entitled \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management\u201d beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement.\n \n-59-\nTable of Contents\nEmployment Agreements with Named Executive Officers\nEach NEO has an employment agreement with Seagen providing for severance payments and termination benefits upon a termination by Seagen without\n\u201ccause\u201d or due to a \u201cconstructive termination.\u201d The merger will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of the NEOs\u2019 employment agreements. In\nthe event of a termination of employment by Seagen without \u201ccause\u201d or due to a \u201cconstructive termination\u201d in the three months prior to, or 18 months\nfollowing, a change in control of Seagen, the NEOs (other than Dr. Siegall, whose separation agreement is described below) will be entitled to receive\npayment of severance benefits equal to, for Mr. Epstein, his annual base salary for 36 months and 3 times his target bonus, for Dr. Dansey, his annual\nbase salary for 24 months and 2 times his target bonus, and for Mr. Simpson, Mr. Romp, Ms. Liu and Mr. Himes, his or her annual base salary for 18\nmonths and 1.5 times his or her target bonus. In addition, each NEO will be entitled to receive (i) payment of 18 months of COBRA premiums, and (ii)\ndouble-trigger acceleration of equity awards (unless otherwise provided in an equity award agreement). For Mr. Epstein, any clawback provisions\napplicable to the relocation payment provided to him in connection with his employment will not apply if he is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d or due to a\n\u201cconstructive termination\u201d in the three months prior to or 18 months following a change in control of Seagen. Such severance benefits (other than with\nrespect to the lapse of the clawback applicable to Mr. Epstein\u2019s relocation payment) are conditioned upon such executive\u2019s resignation from all positions\nheld by such executive and execution of a full release and waiver of claims.\nFor an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Seagen\u2019s NEOs under their employment agreements\nupon a qualifying termination, see the section entitled \u201c \u2014Interests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Golden Parachute\nCompensation\u201d beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement.\nSeparation Agreement with Dr. Siegall\nOn May 15, 2022, Seagen entered into a letter agreement with Dr. Siegall (the \u201cSiegall separation agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Seagen and Dr. Siegall\nmutually agreed that Dr. Siegall would resign as our president, chief executive officer and as a member of the Board effective May 15, 2022. The Siegall\nseparation agreement provides that, due to the unique positions held by Dr. Siegall and Dr. Siegall\u2019s agreement to certain terms and conditions not\nprovided for in his employment agreement, including the extension of the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, in the event that a change in\ncontrol occurs on or prior to December 31, 2023, notwithstanding his earlier termination, Dr. Siegall would receive the remaining severance, equity vesting,\nand healthcare benefits that he would have been entitled to under the Siegall employment agreement had he been terminated in connection with such\nchange in control. If the closing of the merger (the \u201cclosing\u201d) occurs on or prior to December 31, 2023, Dr. Siegall will be entitled to receive: (i) payment of\nseverance benefits equal to his (a) annual base salary for 18 months, (b) 1.5 times his target bonus and (c) his target annual bonus for 2022 multiplied by\n0.37\u037e (ii) payment of COBRA premiums until May 15, 2025, and (iii) the portion of his equity awards that did not become vested in connection with his\nseparation will become fully vested and, in the case of stock options, exercisable. In the event the closing occurs after December 31, 2023, Dr. Siegall will\nnot be entitled to such payments and benefits.\nFor an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would be payable to Dr. Siegall under the Siegall separation agreement, see the section\nentitled \u201c\u2014Interests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d beginning on page 62 of this proxy\nstatement.\nSection 280G Letter Agreements\nBecause Mr. Epstein was recently hired as Seagen\u2019s chief executive officer in November 2022, and Dr. Dansey was the interim chief executive officer in\n2022 and transitioned into the role of president, research & development and chief medical officer in 2022, in connection with these appointments, both\nMr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey received substantial performance-based equity compensation awards in 2022 in order to facilitate an alignment of interests\nbetween the executive and Seagen stockholders. Notwithstanding the strong positive\n \n-60-\nTable of Contents\nalignment these performance awards have with stockholders, these performance awards have much worse treatment under Section 4999 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), than time vested awards.\nIn light of these considerations, on March 12, 2023, Seagen entered into letter agreements with Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey providing that, in the event\nthat the applicable executive receives any payments or benefits that are subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, such executive will\nreceive a payment that puts such executive in the same after-tax position as though such tax did not apply.\nFor an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would be payable to Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey under their letter agreements, see the\nsection entitled \u201c\u2014Interests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d beginning on page 62 of this\nproxy statement.\nRetention Awards\nOn April 1, 2023, Seagen granted certain employees of Seagen retention awards, which vest 20% in the form of cash on the 9-month anniversary of the\ngrant, 30% in the form of Seagen RSUs on the 18-month anniversary of the grant, 25% in the form of Seagen RSUs on the 24-month anniversary of the\ngrant, and 25% in the form of Seagen RSUs on the 30-month anniversary of the grant. At the effective time, each outstanding Seagen RSU granted as part\nof the retention awards will be substituted with a Pfizer cash award in accordance with the treatment generally applicable to Seagen post-signing RSUs,\nsubject to substantially the same terms as applied to the awards prior to the effective time. In the event of an employee\u2019s termination following the\neffective time without \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in Seagen\u2019s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan), or due to death or disability, the portion of the\nretention awards scheduled to vest on and prior to the 24-month anniversary of the grant (75% of the total award) will vest.\nFor an estimate of the value of the retention awards described above that would be payable to Seagen\u2019s NEOs upon a qualifying termination, see the\nsection entitled \u201c\u2014Interests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d beginning on page 62 of this\nproxy statement.\nAnnual Bonus\nIf the date the closing of the merger occurs (the \u201cclosing date\u201d) prior to the date bonuses in respect of the 2023 fiscal year would be paid in the ordinary\ncourse, Seagen may pay each of its eligible employees an annual bonus for 2023 (pro-rated for the portion of 2023 elapsed as of the closing, if the closing\noccurs on or before December 31, 2023) based on actual performance as of the closing date. If the closing date occurs after January 1, 2024, on a\nsubsequent termination without \u201ccause\u201d (as determined by Pfizer in a manner consistent with Pfizer\u2019s plans), a prorated bonus in respect of the 2024\nfiscal year will be paid based on target performance if the termination is prior to July 1, 2024, or actual performance if the termination is on or after July 1,\n2024 (and reasonably determinable).\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Seagen\u2019s directors and officers will be entitled to certain ongoing\nindemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies. For a description of such ongoing indemnification and coverage\nobligations, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Indemnification and Insurance\u201d beginning on page 82 of this\nproxy statement.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits to Seagen\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which\nrequires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each NEO of Seagen that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. This\ncompensation is referred to as\n \n-61-\nTable of Contents\n\u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of Seagen stockholders.\nThe table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of Seagen\u2019s NEOs would receive in connection with the merger, assuming (1)\nthat the merger was consummated, and each such NEO experienced a qualifying termination on December 31, 2023 (which is the assumed date solely for\npurposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure)\u037e (2) a per share price of our common stock of $229.00 (the merger consideration)\u037e (3) that\neach NEO\u2019s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from those in effect as of the date of this proxy statement\u037e and (4) equity awards\nthat are outstanding as of April 7, 2023.\nThe calculations in the table below do not include any amounts that the NEOs were entitled to receive or that will vest per their terms prior to December\n31, 2023.

Amounts shown reflect the value of the applicable multiple of continued COBRA coverage payable by Seagen to Seagen\u2019s NEOs (and the\nNEO\u2019s spouse and dependents, as applicable). Such benefits are \u201cdouble trigger\u201d and become payable only upon a qualifying termination under\nthe terms of the NEO\u2019s employment agreement.\n(5)\nTax Reimbursement. Because Mr. Epstein was recently hired as Seagen\u2019s chief executive officer in November 2022, and Dr. Dansey was the interim\nchief executive officer in 2022 and transitioned into the role of president, research & development and chief medical officer in 2022, in connection\nwith these appointments, both Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey received substantial performance-based equity compensation awards in 2022 in order to\nfacilitate an alignment of interests between the executive and Seagen stockholders. Notwithstanding the strong positive alignment these\nperformance awards have with stockholders, these performance awards have much worse treatment under Section 4999 of the Code than time\nvested awards. In light of these considerations, on March 12, 2023, Seagen entered into letter agreements with Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey\nproviding that, in the event that the applicable executive receives any payments or benefits that are subject to an excise tax imposed by Section\n4999 of the Code, such executive will receive a payment that puts such executive in the same after-tax position as though such tax did not apply. A\npreliminary estimate of the amount of the payments that would be payable to Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey under the 280G letter agreements upon a\nchange in control on December 31, 2023 are provided in the table, although the final amount will not be known until the closing. The payments are\n\u201csingle trigger,\u201d but the estimates provided assume that Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey experience a qualifying termination. If the closing occurs on or\nafter January 1, 2024, it is anticipated that such payments and benefits would be substantially lower.\nFinancing of the Merger",

In particular, the merger agreement and this\nsummary are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding the actual state of any facts and circumstances relating to\nSeagen or Pfizer. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by and covenants of Seagen, Pfizer and Merger Sub that were made only\nfor purposes of the merger agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely\nfor the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, were qualified and subject to important limitations in connection with negotiating the terms of the\nmerger agreement (including by being qualified by the confidential disclosure letter exchanged between the parties to the merger agreement) and may be\nsubject to a contractual standard of materiality that may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors. In particular, in your review of the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations\nand warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right\nnot to close the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and\nallocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts.

This proposal is commonly known as\n\u201csay-on-golden parachutes,\u201d and we refer to it as the compensation proposal.\nThe Board encourages you to review carefully the compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Seagen approve the following resolution:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the stockholders of Seagen hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid, or become payable,\nto Seagen\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the\ntable in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cInterests of Seagen\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Quantification of Payments\nand Benefits to Seagen\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative\ndisclosures.\u201d\nThe vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may\nvote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the compensation proposal\nis advisory only, it will not be binding on either Seagen or Pfizer. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and the merger is completed, the\ncompensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Seagen\nstockholders.\nAssuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, the above resolution approving the compensation proposal on an advisory basis will require the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively for the proposal via the virtual meeting website or by proxy at the special\nmeeting.\nThe Board unanimously recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal.\n \n-90-Table of Contents",

            "text": "MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER\nThe following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of our\ncommon stock whose shares of our common stock are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of the\nCode, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, judicial opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretation at any time,\npossibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in\nthis discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax\nconsiderations described in this discussion. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion has been or will be rendered, regarding\nany matter discussed below or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes:\n \n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n \n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any\nstate thereof, or the District of Columbia\u037e\n \n\u2022\na trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust\u2019s administration and one or more \u201cUnited\nStates persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Code) are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust has a valid\nelection in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a \u201cUnited States Person\u201d (within the meaning of the Code)\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nan estate the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source.\nThis discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of our common stock who hold such shares as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221\nof the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a\ncomplete analysis or to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder\u2019s particular facts and\ncircumstances, or that may apply to a holder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, holders\nwho are not U.S. holders, insurance companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, dealers or brokers in securities,\ncommodities or foreign currencies, dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of our common\nstock, holders that directly, indirectly or constructively own or have owned 5% or more of the combined voting power of our common stock, or of the\ntotal value of our common stock, U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, tax-deferred accounts,\nretirement plans or accounts, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, pension funds, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, U.S.\nexpatriates, former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code, partnerships (or other\nentities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), S corporations, or other pass-through entities or investors in any\nsuch entities, grantor trusts, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, holders who hold shares of our common stock as part of a\nhedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction or other integrated investment, holders that directly, indirectly or constructively own an\nequity interest in Pfizer, holders required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to our common stock as a result of such\nincome being taken into account on an applicable financial statement, and holders who acquired their shares of our common stock through the exercise of\nemployee stock options or other compensation arrangements). This discussion also does not address any tax consequences arising under any alternative\nminimum tax, the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the Code or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of\n \n-95-Table of Contents\n2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection\ntherewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement). In addition, no information is provided with respect to\nany tax consequences under state, local, or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax (such as, for\nexample, U.S. federal estate or gift tax laws). This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences in respect of dissenting\nshares or of any transaction other than the merger.\nIf a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner\nof shares of our common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners,\nthe activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, a partnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes that holds our common stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the\nmerger to their specific circumstances.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of the merger to any particular holder of our common stock will depend on the holder\u2019s particular tax\ncircumstances. Holders of our common stock should consult their tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of the merger,\nincluding the applicability and effect of any alternative minimum tax, the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income and any other U.S.\nfederal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws and any changes in those tax laws.\nConsequences to U.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of our common stock\npursuant to the merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that the U.S. holder receives\npursuant to the merger and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock will\ngenerally equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for such shares.\nIf a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of our common stock surrendered in the merger is greater than one year as of the date of the merger, any\ngain or loss so recognized by the U.S. holder will generally be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders,\nincluding individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a\nU.S. holder acquired different blocks of our common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and\nholding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. holders in connection with the merger.\nPayments made in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be subject to backup withholding (currently, at a rate of\n24%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return IRS Form W-9, certifying\nunder penalties of perjury that such U.S. holder is a \u201cUnited States person\u201d (within the meaning of the Code), the taxpayer identification number provided\nis correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding, and must otherwise comply with all applicable requirements of the backup\nwithholding rules.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax.

            "text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS\nIf the merger is completed, holders of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time who do not vote in favor\nof the merger agreement proposal, who validly demand appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and have not effectively withdrawn their demand or\notherwise waived or lost their rights to appraisal are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger under\nSection 262 of the DGCL.\nThis section is intended only as a brief summary of certain provisions of the statutory procedures that a person must follow under the DGCL in order to\nseek and perfect appraisal rights in connection with the merger. The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal\nrights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at\nthe following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and is incorporated by reference herein. The\nfollowing summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that persons entitled to appraisal exercise their\nappraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Failure to follow precisely the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for demanding and perfecting\nappraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a (i) \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record\nholder of shares of our common stock, (ii) \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d are to a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and (iii) \u201cperson\u201d are to an individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or\nother entity.\nPursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, when a merger agreement will be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, a company must notify each\nof its stockholders who was a stockholder of record on the record date for notice of such meeting, with respect to shares of our common stock for which\nappraisal rights are available, not less than 20 days before the special meeting to vote on the merger agreement, that appraisal rights are available. Either a\ncopy of Section 262 of the DGCL must be included with the notice or the notice must direct stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at\nwhich Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost.\nThis proxy statement constitutes Seagen\u2019s notice pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in\nconnection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262, in\ncompliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the provisions of\nSection 262 of the DGCL, which is accessible at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262,\nparticularly the procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights. Failure to strictly comply, timely and properly, with the\nrequirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for\nexercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of our common stock, Seagen encourages stockholders considering exercising such rights to consult with\nyour legal and financial advisors.\nIf you wish to demand appraisal of your shares of our common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: (i) you must deliver to Seagen a\nwritten demand for an appraisal of your shares of our common stock before the vote is taken on the merger agreement proposal at the special meeting,\nwhich written demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder of record of shares of our common stock who intends to demand\nappraisal of such person\u2019s shares of our common stock\u037e (ii) you must hold your shares of our common stock from the date of making such demand and\ncontinue to hold your shares of our common stock through the effective time\u037e (iii) you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of, or consent in writing\nto, the merger agreement proposal with respect to your shares of our common stock for which you intend to demand appraisal\u037e (iv) you or any other\nperson entitled to demand an appraisal in connection with the merger must not thereafter withdraw your demand for appraisal of your shares of our\ncommon stock or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the DGCL\u037e and (v) you otherwise meet the criteria and follow the\nprocedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.\n \n-98-Table of Contents\nIf any of these conditions is not satisfied with respect to any of your shares of our common stock and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to\nreceive the merger consideration for such shares of our common stock as provided in the merger agreement, but you will not have appraisal rights with\nrespect to such shares of our common stock. A proxy with respect to any such shares of our common stock that is submitted and does not contain voting\ninstructions will, unless revoked, be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the merger agreement proposal, result in the loss of the stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal with respect to\nsuch shares of our common stock and nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal in respect thereof. Therefore, a stockholder who\nsubmits a proxy for such person\u2019s shares of our common stock and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights with respect to such shares of our common\nstock must either revoke such proxy, submit a later-dated proxy with respect to such shares of our common stock containing instructions to vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger agreement proposal or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d from voting on the merger agreement proposal or attend the special meeting and vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger agreement proposal or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d from voting on the merger agreement proposal with respect to such shares of our common\nstock. Voting against or failing to vote for the merger agreement proposal by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of\nSection 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the merger agreement proposal.\nRecord Holders\nA demand for appraisal by a holder of record must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform us of the identity of\nthe stockholder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares of our common stock in connection with the\nmerger. If a holder of record is submitting a demand with respect to shares of our common stock owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity,\nsuch as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner in such capacity, and if the shares of our\ncommon stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on\nbehalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf\nof a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is\nacting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of record, such as a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of our\ncommon stock as nominee or intermediary for one or more beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of our common stock\nheld for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the\nnumber of shares of our common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of our common stock is expressly mentioned, the\ndemand will be presumed to cover all shares of our common stock held in the name of the holder of record.\nBeneficial Owners\nA beneficial owner may, in such person\u2019s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner\u2019s shares of our common stock in accordance with\nthe procedures of subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 of the DGCL summarized above, provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such\nshares of our common stock through the effective time and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of\nsubsection (a) of Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares of\nour common stock for which the demand is made, is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of stock and\na statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner\nconsents to receive notices given by Seagen under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the verified list (defined below). The shares of our\ncommon stock are currently listed on a national securities exchange, and, assuming such shares of our common stock remain listed on a national\nsecurities exchange immediately prior to the merger (which we expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of our common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total\nnumber of shares of our common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for appraisal or (y) the\nvalue of\n \n-99-\nTable of Contents\nthe aggregate consideration offered pursuant to the merger Agreement in respect of such total number of shares of our common stock exceeds $1.0\nmillion. We refer to these conditions as the \u201cminimum conditions.\u201d\nAlthough not expressly required by Section 262 of the DGCL, Seagen reserves the right to take the position that it may require the submission of all\ninformation required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any person sharing beneficial ownership of\nthe shares of our common stock for which such demand is submitted. All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be\nmailed or delivered to our Corporate Secretary at 21823 30th Drive SE, Bothell, Washington 98021. Demands for appraisal may not be submitted by\nelectronic transmission.\nActions After Consummation of the Merger\nIf the merger is consummated, within 10 days after the effective time, Seagen, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will notify each Seagen\nstockholder of record who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who has not voted in favor of the approval\nand adoption of the merger agreement, and any beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective time, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a\nproceeding as a named party may withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger\nagreement by delivering to us a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, either Seagen,\nas the surviving corporation to the merger, or any person who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal\nrights under Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served\non Seagen, as the surviving corporation, in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or beneficial owner, demanding a determination of the\nfair value of the shares of our common stock held by all Seagen stockholders entitled to appraisal. Seagen, as the surviving corporation to the merger, is\nunder no obligation to file any such petition and has no present intent of doing so. Accordingly, it is your obligation to initiate all necessary action to\nperfect your appraisal rights in respect of your shares of our common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. All demands for\nappraisal (i) should be addressed to our Corporate Secretary at 21823 30th Drive SE, Bothell, Washington 98021 and (ii) must be delivered to Seagen\nbefore the vote is taken on the merger agreement proposal at the special meeting. The demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Seagen of the\nidentity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of the fair value of such person\u2019s shares of our common stock. The\nfailure of a record holder or beneficial owner of shares of our common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 of the DGCL,\nand deliver to Seagen the written demand for appraisal prior to the taking of the vote on the merger agreement proposal at the special meeting, will result\nin the loss of appraisal rights.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled,\nupon written request, to receive from Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of our\ncommon stock not voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which we have received demands for\nappraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares of our common stock (provided that, where a\nbeneficial owner makes a demand on his, her or its own behalf, the record holder of such shares of our common stock will not be considered a separate\nstockholder holding such shares of our common stock for purposes of such aggregate number). Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger, must\ngive this statement to the requesting stockholder or beneficial owner within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10\ndays after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a record holder of shares of our common stock or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is served upon\nSeagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger, then Seagen, as the\n \n-100-\nTable of Contents\nsurviving corporation of the merger, will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified\nlist (the \u201cverified list\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares of our common stock and with\nwhom agreements as to the value of their shares of our common stock have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger,\nand all Seagen stockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication will be\napproved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs of these notices will be borne by Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger.\nAfter providing notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to\ndetermine those persons who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares of our common stock to submit their stock certificates to the\nDelaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to comply with that direction,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.\nIn addition, assuming our common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all our stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless one of the minimum conditions is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the persons entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of our common stock\nsubject to appraisal, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, to be paid upon the amount\ndetermined to be the fair value.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of\nDelaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered,\nand that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that,\nin making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise\nand any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on the future prospects of the merged corporation. Section\n262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In\nCede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known\nelements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,\nthe Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof\nas of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of our common stock as so determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal\nof their shares of our common stock and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement is not an opinion as to, and might not in any manner address, \u201cfair value\u201d under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL. Although we believe that the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement is fair, no representation is made as to the\noutcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons considering exercising appraisal rights\n \n-101-\nTable of Contents\nshould recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration offered\npursuant to the merger agreement. Neither Seagen nor Pfizer anticipates offering more than the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger\nagreement to any holder of shares of our common stock exercising appraisal rights, and Seagen and Pfizer each reserve the right to make a voluntary cash\npayment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL,\nthe \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of our common stock is less than the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement. If a demand for appraisal\nis duly withdrawn, a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, neither of the minimum conditions is met (assuming our common stock remained listed on a\nnational securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time) or other requirements imposed by Section 262 of the DGCL to perfect and seek\nappraisal are not satisfied, then the right to an appraisal will cease.\nUpon application by Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger, or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any\nperson whose name appears on the verified list may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to\nappraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares of our common stock by Seagen, as the surviving corporation of\nthe merger, to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each such person upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay order. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person\nwhose name appears on the verified list who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares of our common stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of\nSection 262 of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under subsection (k) of Section 262 of the DGCL. In the\nabsence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of such person\u2019s shares of our common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, or loses or\nsuccessfully withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of our common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the\neffective time into the right to receive the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose\nor withdraw, such person\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time, neither of the minimum conditions\nis met (assuming our common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time) or if the person delivers to\nSeagen a written withdrawal of the person\u2019s demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nFrom and after the effective time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person\u2019s shares of our common stock\nwill be entitled to vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares of our\ncommon stock, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record as of a time prior to the effective time. If no petition for an\nappraisal is filed, if neither of the minimum conditions is met (assuming our common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately\nprior to the effective time), or if the person who has made a demand for appraisal delivers to Seagen a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal in\nrespect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares of our common stock within 60 days after the effective time in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,\nthen the right of such person to an appraisal of such shares of our common stock will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, however,\n \n-102-\nTable of Contents\nno appraisal proceeding will be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and such approval may be\nconditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application\nto the Delaware Court of Chancery made under subsection (j) of Section 262 of the DGCL, provided that this sentence does not affect the right of any\nperson who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and\nto accept the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days after the effective time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights.\nConsequently, any stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult with your legal and financial advisors\nbefore attempting to exercise those rights. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL,\nSection 262 of the DGCL will govern.\n \n-103-\nTable of Contents\nMULTIPLE STOCKHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS",

However, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board is increased and either all of the nominees for director\nor the size of the increased Board is not publicly announced or disclosed by Seagen on or prior to February 20, 2024, a stockholder\u2019s notice to our\nCorporate Secretary will also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if the stockholder\u2019s\nnotice is delivered to our Corporate Secretary at the above address not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the first date all of such\nnominees or the size of the increased Board has been publicly announced or disclosed by Seagen.\nWe also advise you to review our bylaws, which contain additional requirements about advance notice of stockholder proposals and director\nnominations, including attendance requirements. A stockholder\u2019s notice to our Corporate Secretary must set forth the information required by our bylaws\nwith respect to each nominee or matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the 2024 annual meeting and must be updated not later than 10 days\nafter the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the 2024 annual meeting to provide any material changes in the foregoing\ninformation. The person presiding at the 2024 annual meeting may determine, if the facts warrant, that a nominee or matter has not been properly brought\nbefore the annual meeting and, therefore, may not be considered at the annual meeting. In addition, the proxy solicited by the Board for the 2024 annual\nmeeting will confer discretionary voting authority with respect to (i) any proposal presented by a stockholder at that meeting for which Seagen has not\nbeen provided with timely notice and (ii) any proposal made in accordance with our bylaws, if the 2024 proxy statement briefly describes the matter and\nhow management proxy holders intend to vote on it, if the stockholder does not comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-4(c)(2) promulgated under the\nExchange Act.\n \n-105-Table of Contents\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION",

As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares of\ncommon stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the \u201cCommon Shares\u201d), or any shares of common stock of Merger Sub, $0.01 per share\n(\u201cMerger Sub Common Shares\u201d):\n(a) Merger Sub Common Shares. Each issued and outstanding Merger Sub Common Share will be converted into and become one fully paid\nand nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.\n(b) Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. All Common Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury shares and\nany Common Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub will automatically be cancelled and extinguished and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be\npayable in exchange therefor. Each Common Share that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or\nthe Company will be converted into such number of shares of the Surviving Corporation so as to maintain relative ownership percentages.\n(c) Conversion of Common Shares. Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than\nCommon Shares to be cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive an\namount in cash equal to $229.00 (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). From and after the Effective Time, all such Common Shares will no longer be outstanding\nand will automatically be cancelled and extinguished and will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate share (a \u201cCertificate\u201d) or book-entry share (a\n\u201cBook-Entry Share\u201d) (as applicable) representing any such Common Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive\nthe Merger Consideration therefor, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of such Certificate or transfer of such Book-Entry Share (as applicable) in\naccordance with Section 2.2.\n2.2 Exchange of Certificates.\n(a) Paying Agent. Parent will designate Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust company that is reasonably\nacceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of the Common Shares in connection with the Merger (the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d) and to receive the\nfunds to which holders of the Common Shares will become entitled in accordance with Section 2.1(c). The agreement pursuant to which Parent shall\nappoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited\nwith the Paying Agent on a timely basis, promptly after the Effective Time (and no later than the same day as the Effective Time occurs to the extent that\nthe Effective Time is before 1:00 p.m. (New York time), or else, the next Business Day) and as and when needed after the Effective Time, cash necessary to\npay for the Common Shares converted in the Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the \u201cExchange Fund\u201d). If the Exchange Fund is\ninadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of the Common Shares are entitled in accordance with Section 2.1(c), Parent will promptly deposit, or\ncause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit, additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments of Merger Consideration,\nand Parent and the Surviving Corporation will in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Paying Agent may invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as\ndirected by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to Parent.\n(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent will\nmail to each holder of record of a Certificate, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Common Shares, whose shares were\nconverted in accordance with Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery\nwill be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to the Paying Agent and will be in such form and\nhave such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for payment\nof the Merger\n \nA-3 \nTable of Contents\nConsideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,\ntogether with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and properly completed and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the Paying\nAgent, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (such payments to be net of applicable\nTaxes withheld in accordance with Section 2.5) for each Common Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered will\nforthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to\nrepresent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without interest thereon, and will not evidence\nany interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a shareholder or other equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal\nto the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2. In lieu thereof, each holder of\nrecord of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Common Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration will upon receipt by the Paying Agent of\nsuch evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request, be entitled to receive, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay, subject to any\nrequired withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration in respect of each such Common Share, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder will forthwith\nbe cancelled.\n(c) Certain Transfer Taxes. If any payment in accordance with the Merger is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the\nsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it will be a condition of payment that (i) the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered will be\nproperly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment will have paid all transfer and other Taxes\nrequired by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or will have established\nto the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. None of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation will have\nany liability for the transfer Taxes and other similar Taxes described in this Section 2.2(c) under any circumstances.\n(d) Transfer Books\u037e No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed,\nand thereafter no further registration of transfers of Common Shares will be made on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the\nholders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing ownership of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to\nhave any rights with respect to such Common Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-\nEntry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, then they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.\n(e) Termination of Exchange Fund\u037e No Liability. At any time following 12 months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be\nentitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent\nand not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agent\u2019s routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates\nand Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or\nother similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-\nEntry Shares, without any interest thereon.
