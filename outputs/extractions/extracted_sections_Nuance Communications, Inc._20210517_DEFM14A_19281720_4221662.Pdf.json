As of the close of\nbusiness on May 14, 2021, there were 286,094,629 shares of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and\nentitled to vote. We expect that a similar number of shares of Nuance common stock will be issued and outstanding\nand entitled to vote at the special meeting as of the close of business on the record date.

For each\nPSU that is subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, Nuance is currently\nperforming at a level that would result in maximum performance payout.\n\u25cb\nNotwithstanding the treatment of awards of outstanding and unvested stock units described above,\nMicrosoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and\nconverting an award into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes).\n\u2022\nIf the treatment described above of an award of stock units held by a non-U.S. employee would be\nprohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the\napplicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance), Microsoft will\nprovide compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have\nbeen provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and as would\nnot result in the imposition of additional taxes under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. This\ncompensation will be provided in the form of a cash payment (less any applicable taxes) or a new equity\naward, as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance.\n\u2022\nFor purposes of the conversion of Nuance stock units described above, the \u201cexchange ratio\u201d is defined as\na fraction, the numerator of which is the merger consideration and the denominator of which is the volume\nweighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts 0.00005 and above rounded\nup) of Microsoft common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending with the last\ntrading day immediately prior to the closing.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn accordance with the terms of Nuance\u2019s Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer\nto as the ESPP, no ESPP participant in the current offering period, which began on February 16, 2021, may increase his\nor her payroll contribution rate or make separate non-payroll contributions, and no new participants may enroll in the\ncurrent offering period. In connection with the transaction with Microsoft, Nuance will take all actions necessary to\nprovide that:\n\u2022\nif the closing occurs prior to August 13, 2021, which is the last day of the current offering period:\n\u25cb\ncause the current offering period to terminate no later than five business days prior to the closing\ndate\u037e\n\u25cb\nmake any pro-rata adjustments necessary to reflect the shortened offering period\u037e and\n\u25cb\ncause the exercise (as of no later than one business day before the effective time) of each outstanding\npurchase right and apply the funds credited to each participant\u2019s payroll withholding account to the\npurchase of whole shares of Nuance common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nprovide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence\u037e and\n\u2022\nterminate the ESPP in its entirety, effective as of the effective time.\n6\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInterests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Nuance in the Merger (page 50)",

In order to complete the\nmerger, Nuance stockholders must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. The approval of\nthis proposal by our stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section entitled\n\u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement - Conditions to the Closing of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 73. The Nuance\nBoard of Directors is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of Nuance common\nstock in connection with the solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and to\napprove the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements\nthereof. This proxy statement includes information that we are required to provide to you under the rules of the\nSEC and is designed to assist you in voting on the matters presented at the special meeting. Stockholders of\nrecord as of the close of business on May 17, 2021, which we refer to as the record date, may attend the special\nmeeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat is included in the proxy materials?\nA:\nThe proxy materials include the proxy statement and the annexes to the proxy statement, including the merger\nagreement, and a proxy card or voting instruction form.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\nA:\nThe special meeting will take place on June 15, 2021, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time. Due to the possible public health\nimpact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and to support the well-being of our employees and stockholders, Nuance\nwill hold the special meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website. The virtual meeting will\nprovide stockholders with the same rights and opportunities to participate as they would have at a physical\nmeeting. You will not be able to attend the special meeting physically in person.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Nuance?\nA:\nThe proposed merger is the acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft through the merger of Sub with and into\nNuance pursuant to the merger agreement. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by the\nrequisite number of shares of Nuance common stock and the other closing conditions under the merger\nagreement have been satisfied or waived, Sub will merge with and into Nuance, with Nuance continuing as the\nsurviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Nuance will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft\nand you will no longer own shares of Nuance common stock. Nuance expects to delist its common stock from\nNasdaq as promptly as practicable after the effective time and deregister its common stock under the Exchange\nAct as promptly as practicable after such delisting. Thereafter, Nuance will no longer be a publicly traded\ncompany.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration of $56.00 in\ncash, without interest and less applicable tax withholdings, for each share of Nuance common stock that you\nown, unless you have properly exercised and perfected and not withdrawn your demand for, or\n1\n1TABLE OF CONTENTS\notherwise lost your, appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100\nshares of Nuance common stock, you will receive $5,600.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes, in exchange for your shares of Nuance common stock. In no case will you own shares in the\nsurviving corporation.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nIf your shares of Nuance common stock are registered in your name in the records of our transfer agent,\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, which we refer to as AST, as of the close of business on the\nrecord date, you are a \u201cstockholder of record\u201d for purposes of the special meeting and are eligible to attend and\nvote. If you hold shares of our common stock indirectly through a broker, bank or similar institution, you are not\na stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and the record owner of your shares is\nyour broker, bank or similar institution. Instructions on how to vote shares held in street name are described\nunder the question \u201cHow do I vote my shares?\u201d below.\nQ:\nHow many votes do I have?\nA:\nYou will have one vote for each share of Nuance common stock owned by you, as a stockholder of record or in\nstreet name, as of the close of business on the record date.\nQ:\nMay I attend the special meeting?\nA:\nYes. Subject to the requirements described in this proxy statement, all Nuance stockholders as of the close of\nbusiness on the record date may attend the special meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting\nwebsite and complete a virtual ballot, whether or not you sign and return your proxy card.

We believe that holding the special meeting online will help support\nthe health and well-being of our stockholders and other participants at the special meeting as we navigate the\npublic health impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19).\nWe designed the format of the virtual meeting to ensure that our stockholders who attend our special meeting\nwill be afforded the same rights and opportunities to participate as they would at a meeting attended physically\nand to enhance stockholder access, participation and communication through online tools.\nQ.\nWhat if during the check-in time or during the meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble accessing the\nvirtual meeting website?\nA.\nIf you encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual meeting during the check-in or meeting time, please call\nthe technical support number that will be posted on the special meeting log in page.

Microsoft has represented to Nuance in that it has available and will have available at the effective time the\nfunds necessary to pay the aggregate merger consideration, including (i) payments to Nuance\u2019s stockholders of\nthe amounts due under the merger agreement and (ii) payments in respect of certain of Nuance\u2019s outstanding\nequity awards pursuant to the merger agreement.\nFor a more complete description of sources of funding for the merger and related costs, see \u201cProposal 1:\nAdoption of the Merger Agreement - Financing of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 54.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nWe encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement (including the merger\nagreement), and the documents we refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the merger\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naffects you.

If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the voting\ninstruction forms provided by your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares.\nQ:\nHow do I vote my shares?\nA:\nFor stockholders of record: If you are eligible to vote at the special meeting and are a stockholder of record, you\nmay submit your proxy or cast your vote in any of four ways:\n\u2022\nBy Internet - If you have Internet access, you may submit your proxy by following the instructions\nprovided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card. Proxies submitted via Internet must be received\nby 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 14, 2021.\n\u2022\nBy Telephone - You can also submit your proxy by telephone by following the instructions provided with\nyour proxy materials and on your proxy card. Proxies submitted via telephone must be received by 11:59\np.m., Eastern time, on June 14, 2021.\n\u2022\nBy Mail - You may submit your proxy by completing the proxy card enclosed with those materials, signing\nand dating it and returning it in the prepaid envelope we have provided.\n\u2022\nBy Virtual Ballot - You may attend the special meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting\nwebsite and complete a virtual ballot.\nFor holders in street name: If you hold your shares in street name and, therefore, are not a stockholder of\nrecord, you will need to follow the specific voting instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other\nsimilar institution. If you wish to vote your shares by virtual ballot at our special meeting, you must obtain a\nvalid proxy from your broker, bank or similar institution, granting you authorization to vote your shares.\nIf you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your\nshares of Nuance common stock will be voted in accordance with your instructions.\nEven if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of\nNuance common stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a valid proxy to vote shares\nwhich you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Nuance common stock by virtual ballot at the\nspecial meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the special meeting and vote\nby virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.\nQ:\nCan I change or revoke my proxy?\nA:\nFor stockholders of record: Yes. A proxy may be changed or revoked at any time prior to the vote at the special\nmeeting by submitting a later-dated proxy (including a proxy submitted via the Internet or by telephone) or by\ngiving written notice to our Secretary at our principal executive offices. You may not change your vote over the\nInternet or by telephone after 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 14, 2021. You may also attend the special meeting\nand vote your shares by virtual ballot.\nFor holders in street name: Yes. You must follow the specific voting instructions provided to you by your\nbroker, bank or other similar institution to change or revoke any instructions you have already provided to them.\nQ:\nHow will my shares be voted if I do not provide specific instructions in the proxy card or voting instructions\nform that I submit?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record and if you sign, date and return your proxy card but do not provide specific\nvoting instructions, your shares of Nuance common stock will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe merger-related compensation proposal.\nIf your shares are held in street name at a broker, bank or similar institution, your broker, bank or similar\ninstitution may under certain circumstances vote your shares on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d matters if you do not timely\nprovide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions provided by them. However, if you do not\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprovide timely instructions, your broker, bank or similar institution does not have the authority to vote on any\n\u201cnon-discretionary\u201d proposals at the special meeting and a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d would occur, as explained in the\nfollowing question and explanation.\nQ:\nWhat is \u201cbroker discretionary voting\u201d?\nA:\nIf you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank or other similar institution may be able to vote your\nshares without your instructions depending on whether the matter being voted on is \u201cdiscretionary\u201d or \u201cnon-\ndiscretionary.\u201d Because brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary voting\nauthority with respect to any of the two proposals, if a beneficial owner of shares of Nuance common stock held\nin street name does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to any of the\nproposals, then those shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If\nthere are any broker non-votes, then such broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nmerger proposal, but will not have any effect on the merger-related compensation proposal. Therefore, it is\nimportant that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.\nQ:\nI understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the special meeting. What constitutes a\nquorum?\nA:\nThe holders of a majority of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special\nmeeting, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum at the special meeting. As of the close of\nbusiness on May 14, 2021, there were 286,094,629 shares of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and\nentitled to vote. We expect that a similar number of shares of Nuance common stock will be issued and\noutstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting as of the close of business on the record date. If you\nsubmit a properly executed proxy by mail, telephone or the Internet, you will be considered a part of the quorum.\nIn addition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be\ncounted for purposes of establishing a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the special meeting may be\nadjourned by the chairman of the meeting pursuant to the authority granted in Nuance\u2019s bylaws until a quorum\nis obtained, subject to the terms of the merger agreement.\nQ:\nWhat is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the annual meeting?\nA:\nThe merger proposal: The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Nuance common stock outstanding and\nentitled to vote thereon is required to approve the merger proposal. This means that the proposal will be\napproved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d that proposal is greater than 50% of the total number of the\nvotes that can be cast in respect of our outstanding shares of common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes\nwill have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nThe merger-related compensation proposal: The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares\nof Nuance common stock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, and voting at the special\nmeeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the\nmerger-related compensation proposal. This means that the proposal will be approved if the number of shares\nvoted \u201cFOR\u201d that proposal is greater than 50% of the shares of Nuance common stock entitled to vote which\nare present, in person or by proxy, and vote at the special meeting, provided a quorum is present. Abstentions\nand broker non-votes will not have any effect on the merger-related compensation proposal.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain a proxy card or voting instruction form?\nA:\nIf you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card or a voting instruction form, please follow the\napplicable procedure below.\nFor stockholders of record: Please contact our proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, at (877) 750-0854\nfrom the U.S. or Canada, or at +1 (412) 232-3651 from other locations.\nFor holders in street name: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar\ninstitution.\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or may become\npayable by Nuance to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?\nA:\nSEC rules require Nuance to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or may\nbecome payable by Nuance to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.\nQ:\nWhat is the compensation that will or may become payable by Nuance to our named executive officers in\nconnection with the merger for purposes of this advisory vote?\nA:\nThe compensation that will or may become payable by Nuance to our named executive officers in connection\nwith the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of Nuance\u2019s\nnamed executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and arrangements that are contractual in nature.\nCompensation that will or may become payable by Microsoft to our named executive officers in connection with\nthe merger is not subject to this advisory vote. For further detail, see the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cProposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote to Approve Certain Merger-Related Executive\nCompensation Arrangements\u201d beginning on page 77.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. After the merger is completed, under the terms of the merger agreement, you will receive shortly thereafter\nthe letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificates or surrender your book-entry shares to\nthe paying agent in order to receive the cash payment of the merger consideration for each share of your\nNuance common stock represented by the stock certificates or book-entry shares. You should use the letter of\ntransmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled upon completion\nof the merger. Please do not send in your stock certificates now.\nQ:\nI do not know where my stock certificates are, how will I get the merger consideration for my shares of Nuance\ncommon stock?\nA:\nIf the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger will\ninclude the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificates. This will include an\naffidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to\npost a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Nuance common stock after the close of business on\nthe record date but before the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date the merger is expected to be\ncompleted. If you sell or transfer your shares of Nuance common stock after the close of business on the record\ndate but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the provision of a proxy) are made\nbetween you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies\nNuance in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share merger\nconsideration if the merger is completed to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of Nuance\ncommon stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or\notherwise transfer your shares of Nuance common stock after the close of business on the record date, we\nencourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or vote via the Internet or telephone.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible and currently intend to complete the\nmerger during this calendar year. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger cannot be predicted\nbecause the completion of the merger is subject to conditions, including the adoption of the merger agreement\nby our stockholders and the receipt of regulatory approvals.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by Nuance stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other\nreason, Nuance stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Nuance common stock. Instead,\nNuance will remain an independent public company, Nuance common stock will continue to be listed and traded\non Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and Nuance will continue to file periodic reports with the\nSEC.\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Nuance will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee upon the\ntermination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement -\nTermination Fee\u201d beginning on page 75.\nQ:\nAre there any other risks to me from the merger that I should consider?\nA:\nYes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the merger. See the section entitled\n\u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 20.\nQ:\nDo any of Nuance\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Nuance\nstockholders generally?\nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors with respect to the merger proposal,\nyou should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different\nfrom, or in addition to, the interests of Nuance stockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the\nmerger agreement, (ii) approving the merger agreement and the merger, and (iii) unanimously recommending that\nthe merger agreement be adopted by Nuance stockholders, the Nuance Board of Directors was aware of and\nconsidered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For a description of\nthe interests of our directors and executive officers in the merger, see \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger\nAgreement - The Merger - Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Nuance in the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 50.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger-related compensation proposal is not approved?\nA:\nApproval of the merger-related compensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote\nis an advisory vote and is not binding. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the\nmerger is completed, Nuance may still pay such compensation to its named executive officers in accordance with\nthe terms and conditions applicable to such compensation.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and\nmultiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one\nbrokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you\nhold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will\nreceive more than one proxy card. Please complete, date, sign and return (or vote via the Internet or telephone\nwith respect to) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.\nQ:\nWho counts the votes?\nA:\nVotes are counted by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., which we refer to as Broadridge, and are then certified\nby a representative of Broadridge appointed by the Nuance Board of Directors to serve as the inspector of\nelection at the special meeting.\nQ:\nWho may attend the special meeting?\nA:\nNuance stockholders who held shares of Nuance common stock as of the close of business on May 17, 2021.\nQ:\nWho pays for the expenses of this proxy solicitation?\nA:\nNuance will bear the entire cost of this proxy solicitation, including the preparation, printing, mailing and\ndistribution of these proxy materials. We may also reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing\nstockholders who hold their shares in street name for reasonable expenses incurred by them in forwarding proxy\nmaterials to such stockholders. In addition, certain directors, officers and other employees, without additional\nremuneration, may solicit proxies in person, or by telephone, facsimile, email and other methods of electronic\ncommunication.\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhere can I find the vote results after the special meeting?\nA:\nWe are required to publish final vote results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four\nbusiness days after our special meeting. See the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d\nbeginning on page 87.\nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Nuance common stock for cash pursuant to\nthe merger?\nA:\nThe exchange of Nuance common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. holder of Nuance common stock who exchanges shares of\nNuance common stock for cash in the merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a non-U.S. holder, the merger generally will not result in tax to you\nunder U.S. federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections with the United States.\nFor a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, see \u201cProposal 1:\nAdoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 54.\nThis proxy statement contains a general discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.\nThis description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it pertain to state, local or other tax\nconsequences. Consequently, you are urged to contact your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax\nconsequences to you of the merger.\nQ:\nWhat will the holders of outstanding Nuance equity awards receive in the merger?\nA:\nFor information regarding the treatment of Nuance\u2019s outstanding equity awards, see the section entitled \u201cTerms\nof the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Treatment of Equity Compensation\u201d beginning on page 60.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan?\nA:\nFor information regarding the treatment of Nuance\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, see the section entitled\n\u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Treatment of Equity Compensation - Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan\u201d beginning on page 61.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement is adopted by Nuance\u2019s stockholders, stockholders who do not vote (whether in person\nor by proxy) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly exercise and perfect their\ndemand for appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under\nSection 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of Nuance common stock are entitled to have their shares\nappraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d\nof the shares of Nuance common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any,\nas determined by the court, subject to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders who wish to\nseek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the\nexercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process.

            "text": "THE MERGER\nThis discussion of the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached to\nthis proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should read the entire\nmerger agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the merger.\nCertain Effects of the Merger on Nuance\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the applicable\nprovisions of the DGCL, on the closing date and at the effective time, Sub will merge with and into Nuance, with\nNuance continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. Nuance expects to\ndelist its common stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the effective time and deregister its common\nstock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. Thereafter, Nuance will no longer be a\npublicly traded company. If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving\ncorporation, and instead will only be entitled to receive the merger consideration, as described under the section\nentitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Common Stock\u201d beginning on page 60.\nThe effective time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware (or at such later time as Nuance, Microsoft and Sub may agree in writing and specify in the certificate of\nmerger).\nEffect on Nuance if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by Nuance stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other\nreason, Nuance stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Nuance common stock. Instead, Nuance\nwill remain an independent public company, Nuance common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq\nand registered under the Exchange Act and Nuance will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nFurthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be\nconsummated, it is likely that the price of Nuance common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is\nuncertain when, if ever, the price of Nuance common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date\nof this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, if the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and\nopportunities on the future value of your shares of Nuance common stock. If the merger is not consummated, the\nBoard of Directors will continue to evaluate and review Nuance\u2019s business operations, properties and capitalization,\namong other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder\nvalue. If the merger agreement is not adopted by Nuance stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any\nother reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Nuance or its stockholders will be\noffered or that Nuance\u2019s business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Nuance will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $515 million\nupon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger\nAgreement -Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 75.\nBackground of the Merger",

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nMark Benjamin, Chief Executive Officer of Nuance, joined Nuance as Chief Executive Officer and a director on April\n23, 2018. On the date prior to Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment, the closing price of Nuance common stock was $14.91 per\nshare. Mr. Benjamin was charged by the Nuance Board of Directors with leading the planning and execution of a\nstrategic transformation of Nuance, with the goal of increasing shareholder value. In furtherance of that charge and in\nkeeping with the Nuance Board of Directors\u2019 commitment to maximizing shareholder value, over the approximately\nthree-year period since Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment, the Nuance Board of Directors and management have regularly\nreviewed and discussed Nuance\u2019s business strategy, performance and competitive position as well as various\nstrategic alternatives, including acquisitions, dispositions, commercial\n26TABLE OF CONTENTS\npartnerships and other strategic transactions. Since before Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of\nNuance, Evercore Group L.L.C., which we refer to as Evercore, has rendered advice to Nuance regarding various\nstrategic and financial matters in support of these efforts by the Nuance Board of Directors.\nOver the past three years, the Nuance Board of Directors have through these efforts directed a transformation of\nNuance\u2019s business through a series of value-creating actions, including the sale of Nuance\u2019s imaging business in\nFebruary 2019, the spin-off of Cerence, Nuance\u2019s automotive business, in October 2019, and the sale of Nuance\u2019s\nHealth Information Management Transcription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business\nin March 2021, as well as share repurchases and debt reduction activities. Through these transactions and other\nstrategic initiatives, Nuance has streamlined its portfolio to focus on the healthcare and enterprise AI segments,\nwhere the Nuance Board of Directors and management observed accelerated demand for advanced conversational AI\nand ambient solutions.\nIn July 2019, a large private equity firm, which we refer to as Party A, contacted senior management of Nuance and\nrequested a meeting to discuss a potential acquisition of Nuance and requested that Nuance provide a form\nnondisclosure agreement.\nAlso in July 2019, the chief executive officer of a global technology company, which we refer to as Party B, contacted\nMr. Benjamin and expressed interest in meeting to discuss conversational AI technologies, among other topics.\nOn July 22, 2019, Nuance and Party A signed a nondisclosure agreement. The nondisclosure agreement did not\ncontain a standstill provision.\nOn August 15, 2019, members of Nuance\u2019s senior management met with representatives of Party A. The meeting\nconsisted of introductions of the Nuance and Party A teams and a high level discussion of Nuance\u2019s business. Party\nA made no proposal to acquire Nuance at that meeting and no immediate next steps were discussed. The closing\nprice of Nuance common stock on that date was $16.36 per share.\nOn August 21, 2019, Nuance and Party B amended an existing confidentiality agreement between the parties to,\namong other matters, extend the expiration date of such agreement. The amended nondisclosure agreement did not\ncontain a standstill provision.\nOn August 23, 2019, executives of Party B and Nuance, including the chief executive officer of each company, met to\nexplore whether there could be mutually beneficial ways for the two companies to work together, including potentially\na strategic partnership or an acquisition of Nuance by Party B. Following this meeting, Party B informed Nuance that\nit had elected not to proceed with further discussions regarding an acquisition transaction involving Nuance and\ncited a lack of strategic fit with Party B. The closing price of Nuance common stock on that date was $16.99 per share.\nBeginning prior to Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of Nuance in April 2018 and through\nOctober 2019, representatives of Nuance and representatives of Microsoft engaged in discussions regarding a\npotential commercial partnership whereby Microsoft would become Nuance\u2019s exclusive cloud provider and Nuance\nand Microsoft would work together to develop and commercialize technology products and services for the\nhealthcare industry, including products that use AI technology.\nhealthcare industry, including products that use AI technology.\nOn October 1, 2019, Nuance completed the spin-off of Cerence that it had announced on November 19, 2018.\nOn October 9, 2019, Microsoft and Nuance formalized their strategic partnership by entering into a license and\ncollaboration agreement and an amendment to an existing cloud hosting agreement between the parties.\nOn October 17, 2019, at Party A\u2019s request, representatives of Nuance and Party A spoke by telephone. Party A\nadvised the Nuance representatives that Party A would be interested in exploring an acquisition of Nuance and that it\nbelieved it could offer a market-premium to Nuance\u2019s then-current stock price of $15.75 if it could confirm a number of\nassumptions with respect to Nuance\u2019s business. Following that meeting, Party A provided Nuance with a due\ndiligence request list and proposed work plan that contemplated substantial engagement between the parties through\nthe end of the year.\nFollowing receipt of Party A\u2019s diligence request list and work plan, Nuance considered the risks and benefits of\npursuing a transaction with Party A at that time. In considering these matters, senior management noted that Nuance\nhad just completed its spin-off of Cerence and was nearing its first post-spin analyst day, scheduled for\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDecember 10, 2019, which Nuance had planned as a re-launch of the new, streamlined Nuance business. In light of\nNuance\u2019s focus on, and the critical importance of, the re-launch of the Nuance business following the Cerence spin-\noff and subsequent analyst day, the challenges and risks associated with diverting management time from those\nexecution priorities and the uncertainty regarding Party A\u2019s interest, Nuance determined to defer further\nconversations with Party A.\nIn late October 2019, representatives of Nuance spoke with representatives of Party A, and informed them that, in\nlight of the recently completed Cerence spin-off and the planned analyst day, Nuance was not prepared to engage in\ndiscussions regarding a potential sale transaction at that time.\nOn December 10, 2019, Nuance hosted its planned analyst day. On that date, the closing price of Nuance common\nstock was $17.60 per share.\nIn January 2020, a representative of Evercore reviewed in the ordinary course of business development activities with\nrepresentatives of a large healthcare services and technology company, which we refer to as Party C, a number of\npotential acquisition opportunities, one of which was a potential acquisition of Nuance. During the conversation,\nrepresentatives of Party C expressed interest in scheduling a meeting with Nuance in the upcoming weeks. At the\nrequest of Party C, the representative of Evercore discussed the possibility of an introduction to Party C with\nmembers of Nuance senior management, who authorized scheduling such a meeting. The meeting was first scheduled\nfor February 13, 2020, then rescheduled to March 30, 2020. On March 24, 2020, the rescheduled meeting was\npostponed indefinitely due to the developing COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying volatility in the broader\nstock market, including a decline in the price of Nuance\u2019s common stock, which had closed at $14.79 per share on\nMarch 23, 2020.\nOn February 25, 2020, during a conversation regarding another company in the ordinary course of business\ndevelopment activities, a representative of a leading cloud technology and e-commerce company, which we refer to\nas Party D, conveyed to representatives of Evercore Party D\u2019s interest in meeting with the senior leadership of\nNuance to explore potential opportunities involving Nuance, ranging from a potential strategic partnership in\nhealthcare to a potential acquisition of Nuance. The representative of Party D characterized their interest as\npreliminary, and indicated that Party D was seeking the meeting to learn more about Nuance\u2019s healthcare business in\nlight of its own nascent activities in the space. Following that conversation, a representative of Evercore\ncommunicated to Nuance senior management Party D\u2019s interest in a meeting with Nuance senior leadership.\nRepresentatives of Nuance and Party D scheduled a meeting for April 9, 2020, but subsequently canceled that\nmeeting due to the developing COVID-19 pandemic. Following such cancellation, Party D did not seek to reengage\nwith Nuance and Nuance and Party D did not have further discussions.\nOn April 22, 2020, Mr. Benjamin and representatives of Party A had a telephone conversation for the purpose of\nkeeping in touch. During that conversation, Party A did not renew its request to meet with Nuance to discussion a\npotential transaction.\nOn or around May 14, 2020, a representative of Party C in a conversation with a representative of Evercore, indicated\nParty C\u2019s desire to reengage in discussions with Nuance. Following that conversation, the representative of Evercore\ncommunicated Party C\u2019s interest to Nuance senior management, who scheduled such a meeting.\nOn June 19, 2020, representatives of Party C met with members of Nuance senior management at Nuance\u2019s offices. At\nthat meeting, Nuance representatives provided a high level overview of Nuance\u2019s Healthcare business based only on\npublicly available information, and Party C requested a second meeting to review Nuance\u2019s Enterprise business and\nto address follow up questions relating to the Healthcare business.\nOn June 26, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin informed the Nuance\nBoard of Directors of the meeting with representatives of Party C. Following extensive discussion, the Nuance Board\nof Directors instructed Nuance management to hold another in-person meeting with Party C as had been requested\nby Party C.\nOn July 9, 2020, representatives of Party C had a phone conversation with Nuance senior executives to discuss\nNuance technology.\nOn July 22, 2020, representatives of Party C met with representatives of Nuance at Nuance\u2019s offices, during which the\nrepresentatives of Party C and Nuance discussed Nuance\u2019s Enterprise and Healthcare businesses.\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 27, 2020, a representative of Party C informed a representative of Evercore that Party C was interested in\nfurther exploring a potential acquisition of Nuance. A representative of Evercore communicated Party C\u2019s interests to\nmembers of Nuance senior management.\nOn or around September 7, 2020, a senior executive of Party C contacted Mr. Benjamin and conveyed a request from\nthe Chief Executive Officer of Party C for another meeting at Nuance\u2019s offices and a demonstration of Nuance\u2019s\nDragon\u00ae Ambient eXperience\u2122 product, which we refer to as DAX.\nOn September 11, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin updated the\nNuance Board of Directors on discussions with representatives of Party C. Also at that meeting, a representative of\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, Nuance\u2019s external legal counsel, which we refer to as Paul Weiss,\nreviewed with the Nuance Board of Directors the directors\u2019 duties in the context of a potential acquisition offer.\nFollowing discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors instructed Mr. Benjamin to have the meeting with the Chief\nExecutive Officer of Party C.\nOn September 15, 2020, representatives of Nuance\u2019s senior management met with the Chief Executive Officer of Party\nC and the president of one of Party C\u2019s divisions. At that meeting, Nuance representatives answered questions\nregarding the business and gave a demonstration of DAX. During the meeting, Mr. Benjamin made clear that he\nbelieved Nuance was in a strong position and expressed his view that the market was not overvaluing Nuance\u2019s\nshares. After such meeting, the representatives of Party C indicated to representatives of Evercore that the recent\nincrease in Nuance\u2019s share price had created valuation challenges for Party C in pursuing an acquisition of Nuance,\nnoting that the price of Nuance common stock had increased from approximately $25.00 per share when Party C\nbegan discussions in June 2020 to $32.97 as of close of trading on September 15, 2020. Representatives of Evercore\ncommunicated Party C\u2019s views to members of Nuance senior management.\nOn September 18, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin updated the\nNuance Board of Directors on discussions with representatives of Party C. Also at that meeting, the Nuance Board of\nDirectors received an update from Nuance management on Nuance\u2019s stock performance, including Nuance\u2019s 5-year\nprice performance and trading multiples relative to peers.\nOn September 29, 2020, representatives of Party C informed representatives of Nuance and Evercore that Party C did\nnot wish to pursue a strategic transaction with Nuance at that time or for the foreseeable future, primarily due to Party\nC\u2019s view on Nuance\u2019s valuation and that any offer at a \u201cmarket\u201d premium to Nuance would be too dilutive to Party\nC\u2019s stockholders. They indicated that they could be interested in making an offer in the future if Nuance\u2019s share price\nwere to fall appreciably from where it was then trading, and in the meantime would like to continue to build upon the\ncommercial aspects of the relationship between Nuance and Party C. The closing price of Nuance common stock on\nthat date was $33.07 per share, which was approximately 121.8% higher than the closing price of Nuance common\nstock on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became Chief Executive Officer (or approximately 165.0% higher if\nincluding the value of the Cerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).\nOn October 2, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin informed the\nNuance Board of Directors of Party C\u2019s decision not to pursue a transaction.\nOn November 11, 2020, a representative of Evercore had, in the ordinary course of business development activities,\nan introductory conversation with a senior executive at Microsoft. In the course of such conversation, which\naddressed multiple topics, including Microsoft\u2019s activities in the healthcare sector, the Evercore representative\ndiscussed recent developments with respect to Nuance. These discussions were preliminary and based solely on\npublicly available information, and no valuations involving Nuance were discussed. The representative of Microsoft\nexpressed Microsoft\u2019s strategic interest in Nuance\u2019s healthcare business, especially given the success of the\nongoing partnership between the two companies, but noted that Microsoft\u2019s willingness to consider a potential\ntransaction was tempered by the highly people-intensive nature of Nuance\u2019s Health Information Management\nTranscription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business.\nOn November 18, 2020, in conjunction with its earnings announcement, Nuance announced the sale of its Health\nInformation Management Transcription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business, which\nNuance had been negotiating over the prior several months.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 19, 2020, representatives of Microsoft contacted representatives of Evercore and requested a meeting\nwith Nuance\u2019s management in order to begin evaluating the merits of a potential acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft.\nDuring this discussion, the representatives of Microsoft noted that the process would include a series of business\nand financial due diligence meetings to validate whether Microsoft did indeed want to pursue an acquisition of\nNuance. Representatives of Evercore conveyed this request to Mr. Benjamin.\nOn November 24, 2020, the Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting at which Mr. Benjamin\ninformed the Nuance Board of Directors of Microsoft\u2019s request for a meeting to explore a potential acquisition.\nFollowing discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors authorized a meeting with Microsoft to discuss with Microsoft\nonly publicly available information concerning Nuance.\nOn December 7, 2020, representatives of Microsoft and representatives of Nuance held an initial meeting at which\nthose present discussed Nuance\u2019s business and the potential benefits of a combination.\nOn December 18, 2020, representatives of Party C and representatives of Nuance had a telephone discussion focused\non potential commercial partnership opportunities between Party C and Nuance. There was no discussion of an\nacquisition of Nuance by Party C in that conversation.\nFollowing the meeting on December 7, 2020, various representatives of Microsoft had follow-up conversations with\nrepresentatives of Nuance, in the course of which representatives of Microsoft requested follow-up meetings with\nNuance in January to review Nuance\u2019s Healthcare and Enterprise businesses and the potential long-term\nopportunities for the two companies on a combined basis. Representatives of Microsoft indicated that following\nsuch meetings and shortly after Nuance\u2019s next earnings release, Microsoft intended to either make a formal proposal\nfor an acquisition of Nuance or notify Nuance that it did not wish to move forward with making an offer.\nOn December 22, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Nuance management updated\nthe Nuance Board of Directors on its discussions with Microsoft. The Nuance Board of Directors authorized Nuance\nmanagement to schedule the additional meetings that Microsoft had requested.\nOn January 9, 2021, Microsoft and Nuance executed a nondisclosure agreement. The nondisclosure agreement did\nnot contain a standstill provision.\nDuring January 2021, representatives of Microsoft and Nuance held several virtual due diligence sessions, focused\non issues including technology, enterprise, go-to-market, financials and potential synergies.\nOn February 2, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting with members of Nuance senior\nmanagement, as well as representatives of Evercore and Paul Weiss, attending. At the meeting, representatives of\nEvercore updated the Nuance Board of Directors on the discussions with Microsoft, and members of Nuance\nmanagement presented to the Nuance Board of Directors financial forecasts for Nuance for the 2021-2025 fiscal years,\nwhich are described in more detail in the section entitled \u201cFinancial Forecasts.\u201d In anticipation of receiving a proposal\nfrom Microsoft, representatives of Evercore presented a preliminary valuation analysis of Nuance. The members of\nthe Nuance Board of Directors, management and the legal and financial advisors also discussed other potential\nacquirers, including the fact that an acquisition by certain large technology companies that had the financial\ncapability to afford an acquisition of Nuance would present substantially greater regulatory risk than the merger, as\nwell as the risk that Microsoft might decline to provide a proposal or discontinue its discussions with Nuance if it\nwere to become known that Nuance had approached other potential acquirers. At the same meeting, members of\nNuance senior management presented an overview of their go-forward business plan, and the opportunities and risks\nassociated with it, including potential disruption from companies with significantly more resources.\nOn February 15, 2021, in a telephone conversation between representatives of Microsoft and representatives of\nNuance, the representatives of Microsoft reaffirmed Microsoft\u2019s interest in Nuance and indicated that an offer would\nlikely be forthcoming during the week of February 22, 2021, following approval of such offer by the Microsoft Board\nof Directors. During this discussion, the representatives of Microsoft again noted that Microsoft would require its\ncustomary confirmatory due diligence process and a co-terminus exclusivity period to complete that process.\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 28, 2021, representatives of Microsoft and representatives of Nuance had a telephone conversation in\nwhich Microsoft indicated that it would be sending an offer letter for an acquisition of all of the outstanding shares\nof Nuance. During this discussion, representatives of Microsoft noted that Microsoft would require an exclusivity\nperiod for Microsoft to complete its confirmatory due diligence prior to entering into a transaction agreement.\nAlso on February 28, 2021, Microsoft submitted an offer letter containing a nonbinding preliminary expression of\ninterest to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Nuance for a purchase price of $53.50 per share, a 20% premium to\nthe volume-weighted average closing price of Nuance\u2019s stock over the previous five trading days and a 6% premium\nto Nuance\u2019s 52-week high closing price. The letter noted that the transaction would not be subject to any financing\ncondition or require a vote of Microsoft\u2019s stockholders and requested that Nuance deliver a response to Microsoft\nno later than March 5, 2021\u037e in addition, the letter did not specify the form of consideration, and was subject to\nNuance entering into a period of exclusive negotiations with Microsoft. On February 26, 2021, the last trading day\nprior to February 28, 2021, the closing price of Nuance common stock was $44.60 per share, which was approximately\n199.1% higher than the closing price of Nuance common stock on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became\nChief Executive Officer (or approximately 292.4% higher if including the value of the Cerence shares received by\nNuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).\nOn March 1, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Nuance senior\nmanagement, as well as representatives of Evercore and Paul Weiss, attending. At the meeting, representatives of\nPaul Weiss reviewed the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in connection with a potential acquisition of Nuance. The\nmembers of the Nuance Board of Directors, management and the legal and financial advisors then discussed the\nterms of Microsoft\u2019s offer, including the implied valuation, form of consideration, timetable and Microsoft\u2019s insistence\nthat it would not proceed without exclusivity. The participants discussed the premium represented by Microsoft\u2019s\noffer, Nuance\u2019s recent share price performance, the development of Nuance\u2019s trading multiples, comparisons of the\nMicrosoft offer to selected measures of Nuance\u2019s intrinsic value and multiples and premiums paid in relevant\nprecedent transactions, among other analyses.\nAt the March 1, 2021 meeting, the members of the Nuance Board of Directors, management and the legal and financial\nadvisors had an extensive discussion regarding whether Nuance should approach other potential buyers. In the\ncourse of these discussions, the participants noted, among other factors, the dramatic rise in Nuance\u2019s share price\nover the preceding months, the limited number of potential buyers with the financial capacity to exceed the price\nbeing offered by Microsoft, the fact that an acquisition by certain large technology companies, including Party D,\nthat had the financial capability to afford an acquisition of Nuance would present significantly greater regulatory risk\nthan the merger, the fact that Party C had stated the previous September (when Nuance\u2019s share price was\nsubstantially lower) that Nuance\u2019s high valuation would preclude it from pursuing a transaction and the potential that\nMicrosoft would withdraw its offer if it were to become known that Nuance had approached other potential acquirers,\nas well as other risks to Nuance in the event of a leak. At the conclusion of the meeting, following extensive\ndiscussion, the Nuance Board of Directors instructed the representatives of Evercore to revert to Microsoft and ask it\nto significantly increase its offer, without specifying a target price or range.\nOn March 3, 2021, acting on the instruction of the Nuance Board of Directors, representatives of Evercore advised\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs, Microsoft\u2019s financial advisor, that while the Nuance Board of Directors was open\nto engaging regarding a potential transaction, Microsoft would need to put forward a materially improved offer in\norder to compel the Nuance Board of Directors to deviate from its compelling standalone path.\nOn March 4, 2021, at the instruction of Microsoft, representatives of Goldman Sachs informed representatives of\nEvercore that, while Microsoft remained enthusiastic about a potential transaction, Microsoft was highly sensitive to\nvaluation given the recent significant run-up in Nuance\u2019s share price, was not willing to negotiate against itself and\nproposed that Nuance make a counteroffer.\nOn March 4, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting with members of Nuance senior\nmanagement. Representatives of Evercore and Paul Weiss were also in attendance. At that meeting, in response to a\nFebruary 2021 request from the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin reviewed for the Nuance Board of Directors\nhis thoughts regarding the execution and market risks underlying Nuance\u2019s current management plan. Among other\ntopics, Mr. Benjamin addressed the extent to which Nuance\u2019s future successful\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexecution of its plan was already embedded in its share price, the competitive threats to Nuance, particularly from\ncompanies with significantly greater resources, and the extent to which Nuance\u2019s balance sheet limited its ability to\naccelerate its growth organically or inorganically.\nFollowing Mr. Benjamin\u2019s presentation at the March 4, 2021 Board meeting, a representative from Evercore updated\nthe Nuance Board of Directors on the response from Goldman Sachs. The members of the Nuance Board of Directors,\nmanagement and legal and financial advisors discussed alternatives for responding to Microsoft and comparisons of\nthe Microsoft offer to measures of Nuance\u2019s value. The participants also again discussed the benefits and risks of\napproaching other potential acquirers. Following extensive discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors instructed the\nrepresentatives of Evercore to revert to Goldman Sachs with a counteroffer of $62 per share.\nOn March 5, 2021, acting on the instructions of the Nuance Board of Directors, a representative of Evercore provided\nfeedback to representatives of Goldman Sachs that the Nuance Board of Directors would consider entering into a\ntransaction with Microsoft at a price of $62 per share. On that date, the closing price of Nuance common stock was\n$42.58 per share, which was approximately 185.6% higher than the closing price of Nuance common stock on April 23,\n2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became Chief Executive Officer (or approximately 261.7% higher if including the\nvalue of the Cerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).\nOn March 8, 2021, at the instruction of Microsoft, a representative of Goldman Sachs informed a representative of\nEvercore that Microsoft needed more time to respond to the counterproposal given ongoing market volatility and\nrestated Microsoft\u2019s sensitivity to valuation given the recent significant run-up in Nuance\u2019s share price.\nOn March 9, 2021, Microsoft submitted a revised written, nonbinding preliminary expression of interest to Nuance to\nacquire all of the outstanding shares of Nuance for a purchase price of $54.50 per share, a 30% premium to the\nvolume-weighted average closing price of Nuance\u2019s stock over the previous five trading days and an 8% premium to\nNuance\u2019s 52-week high closing price. The letter did not specify the form of consideration, and was subject to Nuance\nentering into a period of exclusivity with Microsoft.\nAt the instruction of Nuance, a representative of Evercore and representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke later on\nMarch 9, 2021. In that call, at the instruction of Nuance, the Evercore representative expressed disappointment that\nthe offer was not higher.\nLater on March 9, 2021, Mr. Benjamin spoke by telephone with a representative of Microsoft. The Microsoft\nrepresentative expressed Microsoft\u2019s excitement about the proposed transaction and optimism about the potential\ncombined business. The parties did not discuss in detail the proposed purchase price.\nThe Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting on March 10, 2021, with representatives of Nuance\nmanagement, Evercore and Paul Weiss participating. A representative of Evercore reported on the revised Microsoft\noffer and the discussion with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Mr. Benjamin reported on the discussion with\nMicrosoft. The members of the Nuance Board of Directors, management and advisors then discussed the revised\noffer and the respective premiums it represented to Nuance\u2019s stock price over various periods and points in time, and\nrelative to Nuance\u2019s revenue and EBITDA multiples, as well as a summary of the revised offer relative to various\nvaluation analyses. The meeting participants engaged in an extensive discussion regarding potential responses to\nMicrosoft\u2019s offer and the potential benefits and risks of each. Following such discussion, the Nuance Board of\nDirectors instructed the representatives of Evercore to revert to Microsoft with a counteroffer of $57.50 per share.\nOn March 10, 2021, acting on the instructions of the Nuance Board of Directors, a representative of Evercore\nprovided feedback to representatives of Goldman Sachs that the Nuance Board of Directors would consider\ntransacting at a price of $57.50 per share, and asked that Microsoft confirm that the proposal contemplated all cash.\nOn March 11, 2021, Microsoft submitted a revised written, nonbinding preliminary expression of interest to Nuance to\nacquire all of the outstanding shares of Nuance for a purchase price of $55.50 per share in cash, a 31.7% premium to\nthe volume-weighted average closing price of Nuance\u2019s stock over the previous five trading days and a 10% premium\nto Nuance\u2019s 52-week high closing price. In a conversation later that day, a representative of Goldman Sachs\ncharacterized that offer as \u201cthe final move\u201d to a representative of Evercore and stated that Microsoft\u2019s offer was\nconditioned on Nuance agreeing to a 30-day exclusivity period to negotiate a\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntransaction and allow Microsoft to complete its due diligence. On that date, the closing price of Nuance common\nstock was $44.41 per share, which was approximately 197.9% higher than the closing price of Nuance common stock\non April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became Chief Executive Officer (or approximately 292.3% higher if\nincluding the value of the Cerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).\nThe Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting on March 11, 2021, with representatives of Nuance\nmanagement, Evercore and Paul Weiss participating. A representative of Evercore reported on the revised Microsoft\noffer. The members of the Nuance Board of Directors, management and legal and financial advisors again discussed\nthe financial analyses previously reviewed, the likelihood that Microsoft could be negotiated to a higher price and\nwhether Nuance should grant the requested exclusivity period. Following extensive discussion, the Nuance Board of\nDirectors instructed Evercore to revert to Microsoft with a counteroffer of $56.00 per share, at which price Nuance\nwould agree to the requested exclusivity period.\nOn March 11, 2021, in accordance with the instructions of the Nuance Board of Directors, a representative of\nEvercore communicated to a representative of Goldman Sachs that the Nuance Board of Directors would be willing to\ntransact at a price of $56.00 per share and to grant the requested exclusivity period at that price.\nOn March 12, 2021, acting on the instructions of Microsoft, Goldman Sachs submitted to Evercore a revised written,\nnonbinding preliminary expression of interest for Microsoft to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Nuance for a\npurchase price of $56.00 per share, a 32.6% premium to the volume-weighted average closing price of Nuance\u2019s stock\nover the previous five trading days and an 11% premium to Nuance\u2019s 52- week high closing price, and indicated that\nMicrosoft was not willing to proceed in further discussions unless exclusivity was granted. Microsoft also provided\nNuance with a draft exclusivity agreement, providing for a period of exclusivity ending on April 12, 2021. At the time\nof the offer, the prior closing price of Nuance common stock was $44.41 per share, which was approximately 197.9%\nhigher than the closing price of Nuance common stock on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became Chief\nExecutive Officer (or approximately 292.3% higher if including the value of the Cerence shares received by Nuance\nstockholders in the Cerence spin-off).\nOver the course of March 12, 2021, representatives of Paul Weiss and representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett\nLLP, Microsoft\u2019s external legal counsel, which we refer to as Simpson Thacher, negotiated the terms of the exclusivity\nagreement. Later that day, Microsoft and Nuance executed the exclusivity agreement, pursuant to which Nuance\nagreed to work with Microsoft on an exclusive basis through April 12, 2021 to pursue the potential transaction.\nOn March 13, 2021, Microsoft provided Nuance with a preliminary due diligence request list. Over the following\nweeks, until the execution of the merger agreement, representatives of Microsoft, Nuance and their respective\nadvisors communicated frequently with respect to outstanding diligence material requests and questions.\nOn March 22, 2021, Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, sent an initial draft of the merger agreement to Paul\nWeiss. The agreement provided for, among other terms, a termination fee that would have equaled approximately $734\nmillion based on transaction equity value, which would be payable by Nuance under certain circumstances, including\nif Nuance terminated the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal.\nOn March 30, 2021, Paul Weiss, on behalf of Nuance, sent a markup of the draft merger agreement to Simpson\nThacher. The Paul Weiss markup, among other changes, included a termination fee that would have equaled\napproximately $392 million based on transaction equity value and numerous revisions to the terms of merger\nagreement that would preserve closing certainty, including an enhanced obligation by Microsoft to take actions\nnecessary to obtain required regulatory clearances.\nOn March 30, 2021, a representative from Simpson Thacher advised a representative from Paul Weiss that the\ncontinued employment following closing of Mr. Benjamin and of Dan Tempesta, Executive Vice President and Chief\nFinancial Officer of Nuance, was essential to Microsoft\u2019s willingness to proceed with the transaction, that Microsoft\nwould not consider entering into a transaction with Nuance if Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta did not agree to\ncontinue their employment with Nuance following the closing of the transaction (which would include Messrs.\nBenjamin and Tempesta waiving certain contractual rights under their respective employment agreements) and that\nMessrs. Benjamin and Tempesta should consider retaining counsel to represent themselves in connection with a\nforthcoming proposal by Microsoft for Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta to waive certain rights in connection with\ntheir existing employment agreements.\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn March 31, 2021, Nuance entered into an engagement letter with Evercore for the provision of financial advisory\nservices with respect to strategic and financial alternatives. Nuance selected Evercore to act as its financial advisor\nbased on Evercore\u2019s qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business of Nuance and the industry\nin which it operates.\nOn April 2, 2021, Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, sent a markup of the merger agreement to Paul Weiss. The\nSimpson Thacher markup, among other changes, provided for a termination fee that would have equaled\napproximately $636 million based on transaction equity value.\nOn April 5, 2021, representatives of Paul Weiss and Simpson Thacher held a videoconference in which they\ndiscussed outstanding open issues in the merger agreement. Later that day, Paul Weiss, on behalf of Nuance, sent a\nmarkup of the Merger Agreement to Simpson Thacher which, among other terms, provided for a termination fee that\nwould have equaled approximately $431 million based on transaction equity value.\nAlso on April 5, 2021, after having been informed by a representative of Paul Weiss that they believed that there was\na clear path to resolving all remaining issues under the Merger Agreement, the Nuance Board of Directors granted\napproval for Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta to engage in discussions with Microsoft regarding their respective\nemployment agreements for the period following the closing of the merger. Between April 6 and April 11, 2021, a\nrepresentative of Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, presented draft retention letters to each of Messrs.\nBenjamin and Tempesta and legal counsel to Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta negotiated with representatives of\nSimpson Thacher regarding the terms of each of Mr. Benjamin\u2019s and Mr. Tempesta\u2019s continued employment following\nclosing. During such discussions, the representatives of Simpson Thacher reiterated that Mr. Benjamin\u2019s and Mr.\nTempesta\u2019s continued employment following closing was essential to Microsoft\u2019s willingness to proceed with the\ntransaction, and that Microsoft would not consider entering into a transaction with Nuance if Messrs. Benjamin and\nTempesta did not agree to continue their employment with Nuance following the closing of the transaction (which\nwould include Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta waiving certain contractual rights under their respective employment\nagreements).\nBetween April 5, 2021 and April 9, 2021, representatives of Paul Weiss, representatives of Simpson Thacher and\nmembers of management of each of Nuance and Microsoft and representatives of their respective financial advisors\nhad multiple conversations to resolve outstanding issues under the merger agreement and ancillary agreements and\nexchanged multiple drafts of those agreements. As part of those discussions, on April 9, 2021, Microsoft and Nuance\nagreed to set the termination fee at $515 million. On April 9, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors held a\nvideoconference meeting, with representatives of Nuance management, Evercore and Paul Weiss participating.\nRepresentatives of Evercore made a presentation to the directors that reviewed the terms of the transaction, the\npremium to various benchmarks and multiples implied by the proposed $56.00 per share price, as well as a summary of\nthe revised offer relative to various valuation analyses. Also at this meeting, Evercore reviewed with the Nuance\nBoard of Directors its financial analysis of the merger consideration and delivered to the Nuance Board of Directors\nits opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 9, 2021, to the effect that,\nas of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described\nin Evercore\u2019s opinion, the merger consideration of $56.00 per share to be received by the holders of shares of Nuance\ncommon stock in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For more information about\nEvercore\u2019s opinion, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Fairness Opinion of Evercore.\u201d A\nrepresentative of Paul Weiss then made a presentation to the Nuance Board of Directors that reviewed the fiduciary\nduties of directors as previously discussed, and then reviewed the proposed terms of the merger agreement,\nincluding the conditions to closing, each party\u2019s termination rights, the ability of the Nuance Board of Directors to\nrespond to unsolicited acquisition proposals, Microsoft\u2019s obligations with respect to obtaining regulatory clearances\nand the provisions of the merger agreement relating to employee benefits, incentive equity and bonus payments and\nrelated matters. A representative of Paul Weiss explained the circumstances under which Nuance could be required to\npay a termination fee and the fact that the termination fee as negotiated was at the low end of the range of termination\nfees for comparable transactions. A representative of Paul Weiss reported on the retention letters presented to\nMessrs. Benjamin and Tempesta. After extensive discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors (i) determined that it was\nadvisable and in the best interests of Nuance and its stockholders for Nuance to enter into the merger agreement\u037e (ii)\napproved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement\u037e (iii) resolved to recommend that the\nstockholders of Nuance vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e and (iv) resolved to submit the merger\nagreement to Nuance\u2019s stockholders for adoption at the special meeting.\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOver April 10, 2021 and April 11, 2021, representatives of Simpson Thacher and Paul Weiss spoke on numerous\noccasions to finalize the terms of ancillary documents and prepare for execution of the merger agreement. At the same\ntime, counsel to Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta finalized the terms of the retention letter agreements with Microsoft,\nwhich are described below under \u201cInterests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nOn April 11, 2021, the merger agreement was executed and delivered by the parties.\nOn April 12, 2021, Nuance and Microsoft issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger\nagreement.\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors to Adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby Approving the\nTransactions Contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nOn April 9, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors, after considering various factors described below, and after\nconsultation with independent legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests\nof Nuance and its stockholders to enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger upon the terms and\nsubject to the conditions set forth therein and declared the merger agreement advisable\u037e (ii) approved the execution\nand delivery of the merger agreement by Nuance, the performance by Nuance of its covenants and other obligations\nthereunder, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein\u037e (iii) directed that\nthe adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of Nuance and (iv)\nresolved to recommend that Nuance stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement in accordance\nwith the DGCL.\nThe Nuance Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement, thereby approving the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn recommending that Nuance\u2019s stockholders vote in favor of the merger proposal, the Nuance Board of Directors\nconsidered a number of potentially positive factors, including, but not limited to, the following (which factors are not\nnecessarily presented in order of relative importance):\n\u2022\nPremium to Market Price. The fact that the merger consideration of $56.00 per share in cash to be received\nby the holders of shares of Nuance common stock in the merger represents a significant premium over the\nmarket price at which shares of Nuance common stock traded prior to the announcement of the execution of\nthe merger agreement, including the fact that the merger consideration represents a premium of:\n\u2022\napproximately 275.6% over the closing stock price on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin\nbecame Chief Executive Officer of Nuance (or approximately 353.3% higher if including the value of the\nCerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off)\u037e\n\u2022\napproximately 277.7% over the closing stock price on October 2, 2019, the date after the date that\nNuance completed the Cerence spin-off (or approximately 303.7% higher if including the value of the\nCerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off)\u037e\n\u2022\napproximately 96.3% over the volume-weighted average closing price of Nuance common stock for the\nperiod beginning October 2, 2019, the date after the date that Nuance completed the Cerence spin-off,\nand ended April 8, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\napproximately 66.0% over the volume-weighted average closing stock price of shares of Nuance\ncommon stock for the one-year period ended April 8, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\napproximately 23.8% over the closing stock price of Nuance common stock on April 8, 2021, the last\ntrading day prior to the approval of the transaction\u037e\n\u2022\napproximately 28.6% over the volume-weighted average closing stock price of shares of Nuance\ncommon stock during the 30 days ended April 8, 2021\u037e and\n\u2022\napproximately 10.9% over the highest closing stock price of shares of Nuance common stock during\nthe 52-week period ended April 8, 2021.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nForm of Consideration. The fact that the proposed merger consideration is all cash, which provides\nstockholders certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Nuance common stock following a period of\ndramatic growth in Nuance\u2019s stock price while eliminating long term business and execution risks.\n\u2022\nOpinion of Evercore Group L.L.C. The delivery of the opinion of Evercore, dated April 9, 2021, to the\nNuance Board of Directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the\nopinion and based upon and subject to the various qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, of the\nmerger consideration to the holders of Nuance common stock, as more fully described below in the section\nentitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - Opinion of Nuance\u2019s Financial\nAdvisor - Opinion of Evercore Group, L.L.C.\u201d beginning on page 39.\n\u2022\nFair Value. The belief of the Nuance Board of Directors that the merger represents fair value for the shares\nof Nuance common stock, taking into account the Nuance Board of Directors\u2019 familiarity with Nuance\u2019s\ncurrent and historical financial condition, results of operations, business, competitive position and\nprospects, as well as Nuance\u2019s future business plan and potential long-term value.\n\u2022\nLoss of Opportunity. The possibility that, if the Nuance Board of Directors declined to adopt the merger\nagreement, there may not be another opportunity for Nuance\u2019s stockholders to receive a comparably priced\ntransaction with a comparable level of closing certainty.\n\u2022\nRisks Inherent in Nuance\u2019s Business Plan. Nuance\u2019s short-term and long-term financial projections and the\nperceived challenges and risks associated with Nuance\u2019s ability to meet such projections, including the\ncompetitive threats facing Nuance, particularly from companies with significantly more resources, as well as\nthe risks and uncertainties described in the \u201crisk factors\u201d and \u201cforward looking statements\u201d sections of\nNuance\u2019s disclosures filed with the SEC, including the fact that Nuance\u2019s actual financial results in future\nperiods could differ materially and adversely from the projected results.\n\u2022\nArm\u2019s-Length Negotiations. The fact that the Nuance Board of Directors and Nuance\u2019s senior management,\nin coordination with Nuance\u2019s outside legal and financial advisors, vigorously negotiated on an arm\u2019s-\nlength basis with Microsoft with respect to price and other terms and conditions of the merger agreement,\nincluding obtaining a price increase by Microsoft from its initial price of $53.50 per share to a price of $56.00\nper share as well as the stated position of Microsoft that the agreed price was the highest price per share to\nwhich Microsoft was willing to agree. In addition, the Nuance Board of Directors considered the fact that,\nas to matters related to retention arrangements for key executives, such retention arrangements were not\ndiscussed with Microsoft until after Microsoft increased its price per share to a price of $56.00 per share\nand substantially all terms of the merger agreement were agreed.\n\u2022\nOther Strategic Alternatives. The belief of the Nuance Board of Directors, following multiple years of\nreviews of strategy alternatives and transformative transactions, and considering the remaining strategic\nalternatives reasonably available to Nuance (including continuing to operate on a stand-alone basis), in\neach case taking into account the potential benefits, risks and uncertainties associated with those\nalternatives, that the merger represents Nuance\u2019s best reasonably available prospect for maximizing the\nvalue to Nuance\u2019s stockholders.\n\u2022\nBoard Review of Transaction. The fact that the Nuance Board of Directors met, along with Nuance\u2019s\nfinancial and legal advisors, to evaluate and discuss the material terms and conditions of, and other matters\nrelated to, the merger, in person and telephonically eight times between November 19, 2020, the date that\nrepresentatives of Microsoft requested a meeting with Nuance\u2019s management to begin evaluating the\nmerits of a potential acquisition, and April 11, 2021, the date the merger agreement was signed, and the fact\nthat, during the prior September (when Nuance\u2019s share price was substantially lower), Party C had stated\nthat Nuance\u2019s high valuation would preclude Party C from pursuing a transaction with Nuance.\n\u2022\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The belief of the Nuance Board of Directors that the provisions of the\nmerger agreement, including the respective representations, warranties and covenants and termination\nrights of the parties and termination fees payable by Nuance, are reasonable and customary. The Nuance\nBoard of Directors also believed that the terms of the merger agreement include the most favorable terms\nreasonably attainable from Microsoft.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nConditions to the Consummation of the Merger\u037e Likelihood of Closing. The fact that the Nuance Board of\nDirectors considered the reasonable likelihood of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement in light of the conditions in the merger agreement to the obligations of Microsoft, as\nwell as Nuance\u2019s ability to seek specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger agreement,\nincluding to cause the merger to be consummated if all of the conditions to Microsoft\u2019s obligations to\neffect the merger closing have been satisfied or waived.\n\u2022\nRegulatory Approvals. The fact that the merger agreement requires that Microsoft use its reasonable best\nefforts to take certain actions necessary to obtain regulatory clearance and satisfy the regulatory\nconditions, including the fact that Microsoft agreed to accept potential remedies in order to obtain\nregulatory approval, including Microsoft\u2019s commitment to divest or take other actions with respect to\nbusinesses or assets of Nuance, unless such additional remedies would reasonably be expected to result in\na material adverse effect on Nuance and its subsidiaries, and Microsoft\u2019s commitment to divest or take\nother actions with respect to businesses or assets of Microsoft, unless such additional remedies would\nreasonably be expected to have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived from the merger by\nMicrosoft or have more than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Microsoft and its\nsubsidiaries. For a more complete description of Microsoft\u2019s obligations to obtain required regulatory\napprovals, see the section below entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement - Efforts to Close the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 72. The merger agreement also provides an appropriate \u201ctermination date\u201d by which\ntime it is reasonable to expect that the regulatory conditions are likely to be satisfied. For a more complete\ndescription of the termination date, see the section below entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement -\nTermination of the Merger Agreement\u201d beginning on page 74.\n\u2022\nNo Financing Condition. The fact that Microsoft\u2019s representations contained in the merger agreement\ninclude a representation that Microsoft will have all available funds necessary for the payment of the\naggregate merger consideration and the fact that the merger is not subject to a financing condition.\n\u2022\nAbility to Respond to Certain Unsolicited Takeover Proposals. The fact that, while the merger agreement\nprohibits Nuance from actively soliciting competing bids to acquire it, the Nuance Board of Directors has\nrights, under certain circumstances, to engage in discussions with, and provide information to, third parties\nsubmitting written unsolicited takeover proposals and to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter\ninto an alternative acquisition agreement that the Nuance Board of Directors determines to be a superior\nproposal, provided that Nuance pays a $515,000,000 termination fee. The Nuance Board of Directors further\nconsidered that the timing of the merger would provide ample opportunity for such third parties to submit\nproposals.\n\u2022\nChange of Recommendation. The fact that the Nuance Board of Directors has the right to make an adverse\nrecommendation change to Nuance stockholders if a superior proposal is available or an intervening event\nhas occurred, provided that Nuance pays a $515,000,000 termination fee if Microsoft terminates the merger\nagreement.\n\u2022\nTermination Fee. The belief of the Nuance Board of Directors that the termination fee of $515,000,000 is\nreasonable in amount, at the low end of the range of termination fees for comparable transactions and will\nnot unduly deter any other party that might be interested in acquiring Nuance.\n\u2022\nRetention of Key Employees. The belief of the Nuance Board of Directors that a retention plan for certain\nemployees of Nuance that Nuance would be permitted to implement in connection with the merger would\nhelp assure the continuity of management, and increase the likelihood of the successful operation of\nNuance during the period prior to closing.\n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The availability of appraisal rights with respect to the merger for Nuance stockholders\nwho properly exercise their rights under the DGCL, which would give these stockholders the ability to seek\nand be paid a judicially determined appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares at the completion of the\nmerger.\n\u2022\nRecommendation of Senior Management. The recommendation of Nuance\u2019s senior management in favor of\nthe merger.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Nuance Board of Directors also considered and balanced against the potentially positive factors a number of\nuncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (not necessarily in\norder of relative importance):\n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The fact that Nuance\u2019s stockholders will\nlose the opportunity to realize additional potential long-term value through Nuance\u2019s successful execution\nas an independent public company.\n\u2022\nImpact of Announcement on Nuance. The fact that the announcement and pendency of the merger, or the\nfailure to complete the merger, may result in significant costs to Nuance and cause substantial harm to\nNuance\u2019s relationships with its employees (including making it more difficult to attract and retain key\npersonnel and the possible loss of key management and other personnel) and its customers, partners,\nproviders and suppliers, particularly in the event that the merger is not consummated.\n\u2022\nDiversion of Management Attention. The substantial time and effort of management required to\nconsummate the merger, which could disrupt Nuance\u2019s business operations and may divert employees\u2019\nattention away from Nuance\u2019s day-to-day operations, and the impact of such efforts on Nuance\u2019s business\nin the event that the merger is not consummated.\n\u2022\nTax Treatment. The fact that the all-cash transaction would be taxable to holders of Nuance common stock\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\u2022\nClosing Certainty. The fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to\nconsummate the merger will be satisfied, including approval by the holders of Nuance common stock and\nthe approval of certain regulatory authorities.\n\u2022\nPre-Closing Covenants. The restrictions on Nuance\u2019s conduct of business prior to completion of the\nmerger contained in the merger agreement, which could delay or prevent Nuance from undertaking\nbusiness opportunities that may arise or taking other actions with respect to its operations during the\npendency of the merger without Microsoft\u2019s consent, and the impact of such delay or loss of business\nopportunities on Nuance\u2019s business in the event that the merger is not consummated.\n\u2022\nNo Solicitation. The restrictions in the merger agreement on Nuance\u2019s ability to actively solicit competing\nbids to acquire it.\n\u2022\nTermination Fee. The fact that a termination fee of $515,000,000 could become payable to Microsoft under\nspecified circumstances, including upon the termination of the merger agreement in order to enter into an\nalternative acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal.\n\u2022\nNo Reverse Termination Fee. The fact that if the merger is not completed as a result of regulatory\nimpediments, Microsoft will not be obligated to pay any \u201creverse termination fee\u201d to Nuance.\n\u2022\nLoss of Key Personnel. The risk that, despite retention efforts prior to consummation of the merger, Nuance\nmay lose personnel, and the impact of such losses in the event that the merger is not consummated.\n\u2022\nTiming of Closing. The amount of time it could take from the date of its deliberations and the special\nmeeting to complete the transactions, including the fact that an extended period of time may exacerbate the\nimpact of other risks considered by the Nuance Board of Directors described herein.\nAfter taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Nuance Board of Directors\nconcluded that the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the merger were\noutweighed by the potential benefits of the merger to Nuance\u2019s stockholders.\nThe foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Nuance Board of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive,\nbut summarizes the material factors considered by the Nuance Board of Directors. In light of the variety of factors\nconsidered in connection with their evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, the Nuance Board of\nDirectors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific\nfactors considered in reaching their determinations and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Nuance\nBoard of Directors applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have given different\nweight to different factors. The Nuance Board of Directors did not undertake to make\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nany specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not\nsupport their ultimate determinations. The Nuance Board of Directors based their recommendations on the totality\nof the information presented, including thorough discussions with, and questioning of, Nuance\u2019s senior\nmanagement and the Nuance Board of Directors\u2019 financial advisors and outside legal counsel. It should be noted\nthat this explanation of the reasoning of the Nuance Board of Directors and certain information presented in this\nsection is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in \u201cForward-Looking\nStatements\u201d beginning on page 20.\nOpinion of Nuance\u2019s Financial Advisor\nOpinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.\nOverview\nNuance retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. As part of this engagement,\nNuance requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to\nbe received by the holders of Nuance common stock. At a meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors held on April 9,\n2021, Evercore rendered to the Nuance Board of Directors its opinion to the effect that, as of April 9, 2021 and based\nupon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore\u2019s opinion, the\nmerger consideration of $56.00 per share to be received by the holders of Nuance common stock in the merger was\nfair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated April 9, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the\nprocedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of\nreview undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated\nherein by reference. Nuance encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore\u2019s opinion\nwas addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Nuance Board of Directors (in its capacity as\nsuch) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to\nthe Nuance Board of Directors or to any other persons in respect of the merger, including as to how any holder of\nshares of Nuance common stock should vote or act in respect of the merger. Evercore\u2019s opinion does not address the\nrelative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to\nNuance, nor does it address the underlying business decision of Nuance to engage in the merger.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion Evercore, among other things:\n(i)\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Nuance that Evercore\ndeemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates\u037e\n(ii)\nreviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to Nuance prepared and furnished to Evercore\nby management of Nuance, as approved for Evercore\u2019s use by Nuance, which we refer to as the Nuance\nForecasts, which are described in more detail in the section entitled \u201cFinancial Forecasts\u201d\u037e\n(iii)\ndiscussed with management of Nuance their assessment of the past and current operations of Nuance,\nthe current financial condition and prospects of Nuance, and the Nuance Forecasts\u037e\n(iv)\nreviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of Nuance common stock\u037e\n(v)\ncompared the financial performance of Nuance and its stock market trading multiples with those of\ncertain other publicly traded companies that Evercore deemed relevant\u037e\n(vi)\ncompared the financial performance of Nuance and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with\nthe financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Evercore deemed\nrelevant\u037e\n(vii)\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated April 8, 2021, of the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n(viii)\nperformed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore\ndeemed appropriate\nSet forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with the Nuance Board of\nDirectors on April 9, 2021, in connection with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does not\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npurport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses described and\nthe results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Evercore.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is\nbased on market data that existed on or before April 8, 2021 (the last trading date prior to the rendering of Evercore\u2019s\nopinion to the Nuance Board of Directors), and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nFor purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions, industry sector performance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of\nits opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Nuance. The estimates contained in Evercore\u2019s analyses and\nreviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not necessarily indicative\nof actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those\nsuggested by Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies,\nbusinesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or\nsecurities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore\u2019s analyses\nand reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nThe following summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order\nto fully understand the analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables\nare not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses.\nConsidering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses,\nincluding the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete\nview of such analyses.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nSelected Public Company Trading Analysis\nEvercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of Nuance to corresponding financial multiples and\nratios for the following selected publicly traded companies in the vertical software industry, which we refer to as the\nvertical software companies, and the healthcare technology and enterprise call center technology industry, which we\nrefer to as the HC & ENT companies, and together with the vertical software companies, as the selected companies:\nVertical Software Companies\n\u2022\nVeeva Systems Inc.\n\u2022\nTeladoc Health, Inc.\n\u2022\nSS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.\n\u2022\nTyler Technologies, Inc.\n\u2022\nPTC Inc.\n\u2022\nAspen Technology, Inc.\n\u2022\nCDK Global, Inc.\n\u2022\nGuidewire Software, Inc.\n\u2022\nQ2 Holdings, Inc.\n\u2022\nAppFolio, Inc.\n\u2022\nCerence Inc.\n\u2022\nBlackbaud, Inc.\n\u2022\nAmerican Well Corporation\n\u2022\n2U, Inc.\n\u2022\nPhreesia, Inc.\n\u2022\nHealth Catalyst, Inc.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHealthcare Technology & Enterprise Call Center Technology Companies\nHealthcare Technology:\n\u2022\nVeeva Systems Inc.\n\u2022\nTeladoc Health, Inc.\n\u2022\nCerner Corporation\n\u2022\nR1 RCM Inc.\n\u2022\nOmnicell, Inc.\n\u2022\nPremier, Inc.\n\u2022\nAmerican Well Corporation\n\u2022\nPhreesia, Inc.\n\u2022\nHealth Catalyst, Inc.\n\u2022\nAllscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.\n\u2022\nNextGen Healthcare, Inc.\n\u2022\nVocera Communications, Inc.\n\u2022\nHealthStream, Inc.\nEnterprise Call Center Technology:\n\u2022\nNICE Ltd.\n\u2022\nPegasystems Inc.\n\u2022\nMedallia, Inc.\n\u2022\nLivePerson, Inc.\n\u2022\nVerint Systems Inc.\n\u2022\neGain Corporation\nFor each of the selected companies, Evercore calculated (i) total enterprise value (defined as equity market\ncapitalization plus total debt (assuming conversion of convertible debt if in the money), plus preferred equity and\nnon-controlling interest, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of estimated revenue for the 2021 calendar\nyear, which we refer to as TEV / CY21E Revenue, (ii) total enterprise value as a multiple of estimated earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation, amortization before stock-based compensation expense, and certain non-recurring items,\nwhich we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA (which, with respect to Nuance, excludes restructuring and other costs, net,\nacquisition-related costs, net, and certain other expenses that result from unplanned events outside the ordinary\ncourse of continuing operations), for the 2021 calendar year, which we refer to as 2021E Adjusted EBITDA, which\nmultiple we refer to as TEV / CY21E Adjusted EBITDA, and (iii) market value of equity (defined as equity market\ncapitalization) as a multiple of levered, after-tax free cash flows, which we refer to as LFCF, defined as cash flow from\noperations less capital expenditures, which we refer to as MEV / CY21E LFCF, in each case, based on closing share\nprices as of April 8, 2021. For purposes of calculating such multiples with respect to the HC & ENT companies,\nEvercore assigned a weight of 60% to such healthcare technology companies and a weight of 40% to such enterprise\ncall center technology companies based on its professional judgment and experience. Estimated financial data of the\nselected companies were based on publicly available filings and research analysts\u2019 estimates.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThis analysis indicated the following:\nBenchmark\nMean\nMedian\nVertical Software\nTEV / CY21E Revenue\n11.4x\n11.5x\nTEV / CY21E Adjusted EBITDA\n33.0x\n30.0x\nMEV / CY21E LFCF\n38.1x\n43.7x\nHealthcare Technology & Enterprise Call Center Technology\nTEV / CY21E Revenue\n7.8x\n6.8x\nTEV / CY21E Adjusted EBITDA\n22.1x\n18.6x\nMEV / CY21E LFCF\n34.3x\n28.7x\nBased on the multiples it derived for the vertical software companies and based on its professional judgment and\nexperience, Evercore (i) selected a reference range of enterprise value / revenue multiples of 11.0x - 13.0x and applied\nthis range of multiples to Nuance\u2019s estimated revenue in calendar year 2021 based on the Nuance Forecasts, (ii)\nselected a reference range of enterprise value / Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 30.0x - 40.0x and applied this range of\nmultiples to (a) Nuance\u2019s 2021E Adjusted EBITDA based on the Nuance Forecasts and (b) Nuance\u2019s 2021E Adjusted\nEBITDA (as reduced by the Short Term Incentive Plan expenses, which we refer to as STIP) based on the Nuance\nForecasts, and (iii) selected a reference range of equity value / LFCF multiples of 40.0x - 50.0x and applied this range\nof multiples to (a) Nuance\u2019s estimated LFCF in calendar year 2021 based on the Nuance Forecasts and (b) Nuance\u2019s\nestimated LFCF (as reduced by STIP) in calendar year 2021 based on the Nuance Forecasts.

In evaluating the selected companies, Evercore\nmade judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market conditions affecting the\nselected companies and other matters, as well as differences in the selected companies\u2019 financial, business and\noperating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.\nRather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the\nrelative values of the selected companies and the multiples derived from the selected companies. Mathematical\nanalysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the\nselected companies.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nEvercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Nuance to calculate the estimated present value of the\nstandalone unlevered free cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus the expense of stock-based compensation,\nminus taxes, minus changes in net working capital and capital expenditures, that Nuance was forecasted to generate\nduring the second half of Nuance\u2019s fiscal year 2021 and Nuance\u2019s fiscal years 2022 through 2025 based on the\nNuance Forecasts. Evercore calculated terminal values for Nuance by applying perpetuity growth rates of 4.0% to\n5.0%, which range was selected based on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal year\nestimate of the unlevered free cash flow that Nuance was forecasted to generate based on the Nuance Forecasts. The\ncash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to present value as of March 31, 2021, using\ndiscount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.0%, which were based on an estimate of Nuance\u2019s weighted average cost of\ncapital based on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and experience. Based on this range of implied enterprise values,\nNuance\u2019s estimated net debt as of December 31, 2020, and the number of fully diluted shares of Nuance common\nstock, in each case as provided by Nuance\u2019s management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per\nshare of Nuance common stock of $29.23 to $48.14, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of\nNuance common stock.\nOther Factors\nEvercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to\nits opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:\nSum-of-the-Parts Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nEvercore performed a discounted sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) cash flow analysis of Nuance to calculate the estimated\npresent value of the unlevered free cash flow that Nuance was forecasted to generate during the second half of\nNuance\u2019s fiscal year 2021 and Nuance\u2019s fiscal years 2022 through 2025 based on the Nuance Forecasts. Evercore\ncalculated terminal values for Nuance (excluding the Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience, which we refer to as DAX)\nby applying perpetuity growth rates of 3.5% to 4.5%, which range was selected based on Evercore\u2019s professional\njudgment and experience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow that Nuance was forecasted to\ngenerate based on the Nuance Forecasts. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to\npresent value as of March 31, 2021, using discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.0%, which were based on an estimate\nof Nuance\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. Evercore also calculated terminal values for DAX by applying a\nrevenue multiple of 15.0x - 20.0x, which range was selected based on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and\nexperience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow that DAX was forecasted to generate based on\nthe Nuance Forecasts. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to present value as of\nMarch 31, 2021, using discount rates ranging from 17.5% to 22.5%, which were based on an estimate of the weighted\naverage cost of capital for Nuance in relation to DAX based on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and experience.\nBased on this range of implied aggregate enterprise values, Nuance\u2019s estimated net debt as of December 31, 2020, and\nthe number of fully diluted shares of Nuance common stock, in each case as provided by Nuance\u2019s management, this\nanalysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Nuance common stock of $33.34 to $52.10, compared\nto the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Nuance common stock.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLast 52-Week Trading Range\nEvercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of Nuance common stock during the 12-month period ended\nApril 8, 2021, noting that the low and high closing prices during such period ranged from $16.99 to $50.51 per share of\nNuance common stock, respectively.\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets\nEvercore reviewed public market trading price targets for the shares of Nuance common stock prepared and\npublished by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of April 8, 2021, the last trading date prior to the\nrendering of Evercore\u2019s opinion to the Nuance Board of Directors. These price targets reflect analysts\u2019 estimates of\nthe future public market trading price of the shares of Nuance common stock at the time the price target was\npublished. As of April 8, 2021, the range of selected equity research analyst price targets per share of Nuance\ncommon stock was $45.00 to $65.00. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not\nnecessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares of Nuance common stock and these target prices and\nthe analysts\u2019 earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors\naffecting the financial performance of Nuance and future general industry and market conditions.\nSelected HC & ENT Transactions Analysis\nEvercore reviewed financial information related to selected transactions involving target companies in the healthcare\ntechnology and enterprise call center technology industry announced since, in the case of healthcare technology\ntransactions, 2018, and in the case of enterprise call center technology transactions, 2011, which we refer to as the HC\n& ENT selected transactions.\nFor each healthcare technology selected transaction, Evercore calculated the announced transaction value or, if\nunavailable, the implied enterprise value (defined as the target company\u2019s implied equity value based on the\nconsideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt, plus preferred equity and non-controlling interest,\nless cash and cash equivalents), as a multiple of the last 12-month revenue, which we refer to as LTM Revenue, if\navailable, for the target company at the time of the announcement of the applicable transaction (or where last 12-\nmonth revenue information was not publicly available, as a multiple of the most recent calendar year revenue).\nEstimated financial data of the healthcare technology selected transactions were based on publicly available\ninformation at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\nBenchmark\nMean\nMedian\nTEV / LTM Revenue\n9.7x\n7.5x\nFor each enterprise call center technology selected transaction, Evercore calculated the announced transaction value\nor, if unavailable, the implied enterprise value (defined as the target company\u2019s implied equity value based on the\nconsideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt, plus preferred equity and non-controlling interest,\nless cash and cash equivalents), as a multiple of the LTM Revenue, if available, for the target company at the time of\nthe announcement of the applicable transaction (or where last 12-month revenue information was not publicly\navailable, as a multiple of the most recent calendar year revenue). Estimated financial data of the enterprise call center\ntechnology selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the\nrelevant transaction.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\nBenchmark\nMean\nMedian\nTEV / LTM Revenue\n3.3x\n2.8x\nBased on the multiples it derived from the HC & ENT selected transactions and based on its professional judgment\nand experience, Evercore selected a reference range of enterprise value to LTM Revenue multiples of 6.0x to 8.0x and\napplied this range of multiples to Nuance\u2019s LTM Revenue as of March 31, 2021 based on the financial results for\nNuance provided by Nuance\u2019s management. Based on this range of implied enterprise values,\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNuance\u2019s estimated net debt as of December 31, 2020, and the number of fully diluted shares of Nuance common\nstock, in each case as provided by Nuance\u2019s management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per\nshare of Nuance common stock of $22.43 to $30.21, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of\nNuance common stock.\nAlthough none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the selected transactions analysis is directly\ncomparable to Nuance and none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the merger, Evercore selected\nthese transactions because they involve companies or businesses that Evercore, in its professional judgment and\nexperience, considered generally relevant to Nuance for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating the selected\ntransactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market\nconditions and other factors existing at the time of the selected transactions, and other matters, as well as differences\nin financial, business and operating characteristics and other factors relevant to the target companies or businesses\nin the selected transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.\nRather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the\nrelative values of the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions and the multiples derived from the\nselected transactions. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful\nmethod of using the data of the selected transactions.\nSelected Vertical Software Transactions Analysis\nEvercore reviewed financial information related to selected transactions involving target companies in the vertical\nsoftware industry announced since 2017, which we refer to as the vertical software selected transactions. The vertical\nsoftware selected transactions reviewed by Evercore, and the month and year each was announced, were as follows:\nFor each vertical software selected transaction, Evercore calculated the announced transaction value, or if\nunavailable, the implied enterprise value (defined as the target company\u2019s implied equity value based on the\nconsideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt, plus preferred equity and non-controlling interest,\nless cash and cash equivalents), as a multiple of the LTM Revenue, if available, for the target company at the time of\nthe announcement of the applicable transaction (or where last 12-month revenue information was not publicly\navailable, as a multiple of the most recent calendar year revenue). Estimated financial data of the vertical software\nselected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant\ntransaction.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\nBenchmark\nMean\nMedian\nTEV / LTM Revenue\n8.9x\n8.8x\nBased on the multiples it derived from the vertical software selected transactions and based on its professional\njudgment and experience, Evercore selected a reference range of enterprise value to LTM Revenue multiples of 9.0x to\n10.0x and applied this range of multiples to Nuance\u2019s LTM Revenue as of March 31, 2021 based on the financial\nresults for Nuance provided by Nuance\u2019s management. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, Nuance\u2019s\nestimated net debt as of December 31, 2020, and the number of fully diluted shares of Nuance common stock, in each\ncase as provided by Nuance\u2019s management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of\nNuance common stock of $34.03 to $37.86, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Nuance\ncommon stock.\nAlthough none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the selected transactions analysis is directly\ncomparable to Nuance and none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the merger, Evercore selected\nthese transactions because they involve companies or businesses that Evercore, in its professional judgment and\nexperience, considered generally relevant to Nuance for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating the selected\ntransactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market\nconditions and other factors existing at the time of the selected transactions, and other matters, as well as differences\nin financial, business and operating characteristics and other factors relevant to the target companies or businesses\nin the selected transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.\nRather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nregarding many factors that could affect the relative values of the target companies or businesses in the selected\ntransactions and the multiples derived from the selected transactions. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the\nmean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the selected transactions.\nPremiums Paid Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, Evercore reviewed 80 transactions and announced bids for control of U.S.\npublic targets with an aggregate transaction value greater than $10 billion announced from January 1, 2010 to April 1,\n2021. Using publicly available information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which the per\nshare consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each such transaction exceeded the closing market prices per\nshare of the target companies one day, one week and four weeks prior to announcement of each transaction.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\n1 Day \nPrior\n4\nWeeks \nPrior\n52-\nWeek \nHigh\nMedian\n23.3%\n33.9%\n4.2%\nMean\n28.7%\n40.0%\n7.7%\nBased on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a premium range\nof 20.0% to 40.0% to the closing price per share of Nuance common stock of $45.22 as of April 8, 2021 (the last\ntrading date prior to the rendering of Evercore\u2019s opinion to the Nuance Board of Directors) and $44.21 as of March 11,\n2021 (last trading day prior to receipt of the offer of $56.00 per share of Nuance common stock), and applied a\npremium range of 0.0% to 15.0% to the closing price per share of Nuance common stock of $50.51 as of February 8,\n2021 (the 52-Week High). This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Nuance common stock\nof $54.26 to $63.31, $53.29 to $62.17, and $50.51 to $58.09, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of\nNuance common stock.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the\nanalyses or data presented by Evercore to the Nuance Board of Directors. In connection with the review of the\nmerger by the Nuance Board of Directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for\npurposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily\nsusceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary\ndescribed above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes\nunderlying Evercore\u2019s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of all the\nanalyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it\nfor purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional\njudgment and experience after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given\nvarious analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various\nassumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any\nparticular analysis or combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with\nrespect to the actual value of the shares of Nuance common stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this\nsection not equaling the total of the figures shown.\nEvercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Nuance Board of Directors as to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of shares of Nuance common stock.\nThese analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the business or securities\nactually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future\nresults, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly,\nestimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore\u2019s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty,\nand Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in such\nestimates.\nEvercore\u2019s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Nuance\nBoard of Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger. The issuance of\nEvercore\u2019s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEvercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Nuance Board of Directors or Nuance\u2019s\nmanagement or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the\nmerger for the holders of Nuance common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of Evercore\u2019s engagement letter with Nuance, Nuance has agreed to pay Evercore a fee for its\nservices that is estimated as of the date of the Merger Agreement to be approximately $70 million, of which $7 million\nwas paid upon delivery of Evercore\u2019s opinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the\nconsummation of the merger. Nuance has also agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses and to indemnify\nEvercore against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.\nDuring the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have provided financial advisory\nservices to Nuance and received fees for the rendering of these services in the amount of approximately $1.4 million.\nDuring the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to\nprovide financial advisory or other services to Parent and Evercore has not received any compensation from Parent\nduring such period. Evercore may provide financial advisory or other services to Nuance and Parent in the future,\nand in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.\nEvercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of\ncustomers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity,\nplacement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or otherwise,\nEvercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which any of them\nmay have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or\notherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior\nloans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to Nuance or its affiliates, Parent,\npotential parties to the merger and their respective affiliates or persons that are competitors, customers or suppliers\nof Nuance.\nNuance engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore\u2019s qualifications, experience and reputation.\nEvercore is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly provides fairness opinions to its\nclients in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and valuations for corporate and other\npurposes.",

Nuance provided the Nuance Board of Directors and Evercore with the Nuance Forecasts in connection\nwith Evercore\u2019s financial analyses summarized under Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger\n\u201cOpinion of Nuance\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 39 and also provided the Nuance Forecasts to\nMicrosoft.\nNuance does not normally publicly disclose long-term forecasts or projections as to future revenue, earnings or other\nresults due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions\nand estimates, including the difficulty of predicting general economic and market conditions. The Nuance Forecasts\nwere not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement only because such\ninformation was made available as described above. The Nuance Forecasts were not prepared with a view to\ncompliance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP,\nthe published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines\nestablished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of\nprospective financial information. The prospective financial information included in this proxy statement has been\nprepared by, and is the responsibility of, Nuance\u2019s management. BDO USA, LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined,\ncompiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information\nand, accordingly, BDO USA, LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nAlthough a summary of the Nuance Forecasts is presented with numerical specificity, the Nuance Forecasts reflect\nnumerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by our management, including with respect to\ndemand for Nuance\u2019s products and services, capital expenditure levels for the applicable periods, acquisition-related\nexpenditure levels for the applicable periods and other matters, many of which are difficult to\n47TABLE OF CONTENTS\npredict and subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties beyond Nuance\u2019s control, that our\nmanagement believed in good faith were reasonable at the time the Nuance Forecasts were prepared, taking into\naccount the relevant information available to management at the time. However, this information is not fact and\nshould not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual\nresults and cause the Nuance Forecasts not to be achieved include general economic and financial conditions,\nindustry performance, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows,\ncompetitive pressures and other factors described or referenced under the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking\nStatements\u201d beginning on page 20. In addition, the Nuance Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or\nevents occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be\nno assurance that the Nuance Forecasts will or would be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse\nthan those contained in the Nuance Forecasts.\nThe Nuance Forecasts are not a reliable indication of future results, and Nuance and its management team and\nadvisors do not endorse the Nuance Forecasts as such, and they do not make any representation to readers of this\ndocument concerning the ultimate performance of Nuance or the combined company compared to the Nuance\nForecasts. Nuance is including these Nuance Forecasts in this document solely because they were among the\nfinancial information made available to the Nuance Board of Directors and Evercore in connection with their\nevaluation of the merger, and not to influence your decision on how to vote on any proposal.\nThe Nuance Forecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other\ninformation regarding Nuance contained in our public filings with the SEC. Our management reviewed the Nuance\nForecasts with the Nuance Board of Directors, which considered the Nuance Forecasts in connection with its\nevaluation and approval of the merger agreement and the merger.\nThe Nuance Forecasts constitute forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Nuance\u2019s\nfuture results to materially vary, see the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 20.\nExcept to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any\nresponsibility, to update or otherwise revise the Nuance Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date\nwhen Nuance prepared the Nuance Forecasts or to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general\neconomic or industry conditions, even in the event that any of the assumptions underlying the Nuance Forecasts are\nshown to be in error.\nCertain of the measures included in the Nuance Forecasts may be considered non-GAAP financial measures,\nincluding Adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered\nin isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP\nfinancial measures as used by Nuance may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies.\nPursuant to the published guidelines of the SEC, the non-GAAP financial measures are not required to be reconciled\nto GAAP financial measures.\nNuance Forecasts\nThe following table reflects selected metrics reflected in the Nuance Forecasts:\nFiscal Year Ending September 30\n2021E\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\nNuance Forecast\nRevenue\n$1,387\n$1,551\n$1,856\n$2,220\n$2,593\nAdj.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, and our calculation of Adjusted\nEBITDA may differ from other companies.\n2\n\u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow\u201d refers to Adjusted EBITDA minus the expense of stock-based compensation, minus taxes, minus\nchanges in net working capital and capital expenditures. Unlevered Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure, and our calculation of\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow may differ from other companies.\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTreatment of Equity Compensation\nPursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Nuance common stock in the\nform of stock options and stock units. Our executive officers hold RSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of\nNuance common stock based on service over a time-based vesting schedule, and PSUs, which represent a right to\nreceive shares of Nuance common stock ranging from 0% to 200% of the target number of shares based on both\nservice and achievement of performance goals for a specified performance period. Our non-employee directors hold\nRSUs and DSUs, which represents a right to receive shares of Nuance common stock, subject to vesting\nrequirements of the underlying equity award, on a specified future date or event, such as separation from service. Our\nexecutive officers and non-employee directors do not hold stock options. The merger agreement provides for the\ntreatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity awards:\nStock Options\nEach stock option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration for each share of Nuance common stock\nthat would have been issuable upon exercise of the option, less the exercise price of the option and any applicable\nwithholding taxes. If the exercise price of a stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the\noption will be cancelled as of the effective time for no consideration.\nStock Units\n\u2022\nEach award of stock units that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the effective time or that will\nbecome vested by its terms at the effective time and, in each case, by its terms is to be settled upon the\noccurrence of vesting or the effective time will, as of the effective time, be deemed to be vested and will be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes.\n\u2022\nEach outstanding and unvested award of stock units will, as of the effective time, be converted into a\nRollover RSU as follows:\n\u25cb\nEach RSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that is subject to the same time-based vesting\nschedule as the RSU.\n\u25cb\nEach PSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that, following the effective time, will vest based\nsolely on time at the conclusion of the original performance period of the PSU.\n\u25cb\nThe number of shares of common stock of Microsoft subject to each Rollover RSU will be equal to the\nproduct (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of Nuance shares of common stock\nsubject to the corresponding RSU or PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by a\nspecified exchange ratio (see below). The number of Nuance shares of Nuance common stock subject\nto each PSU immediately prior to the effective time will be determined based on (i) maximum\nperformance, for any PSU that was subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, and\n(ii) target performance, for any PSU that was subject to financial and/or operational performance goals.\nFor each PSU that is subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, Nuance is\ncurrently performing at a level that would result in maximum performance payout.\n\u25cb\nNotwithstanding the treatment of awards of outstanding and unvested stock units described above,\nMicrosoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and\nconverting an award into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes).\n\u2022\nIf the treatment described above of an award of stock units held by a non-U.S. employee would be\nprohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the\napplicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance), Microsoft will\nprovide compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have\nbeen provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nas would not result in the imposition of additional taxes under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.\nThis compensation will be provided in the form of a cash payment (less any applicable taxes) or a new\nequity award, as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance.\n\u2022\nFor purposes of the conversion of Nuance stock units described above, the \u201cexchange ratio\u201d is defined as\na fraction, the numerator of which is the merger consideration and the denominator of which is the volume\nweighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above\nrounded up) of Microsoft common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending with the\nlast trading day immediately prior to the closing.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn accordance with the plan terms, each ESPP participant in the current offering period, which began on February 16,\n2021, may not increase his or her payroll contribution rate or make separate non-payroll contributions, and no new\nparticipants may enroll in the current offering period. In connection with the transaction with Microsoft, Nuance will\ntake all actions necessary to provide that:\n\u2022\nif the closing occurs prior to August 13, 2021, which is the last day of the current offering period:\n\u25cb\ncause the current offering period to terminate no later than five business days prior to the closing\ndate\u037e\n\u25cb\nmake any pro-rata adjustments necessary to reflect the shortened offering period\u037e and\n\u25cb\ncause the exercise (as of no later than one business day before the effective time) of each outstanding\npurchase right and apply the funds credited to each participant\u2019s payroll withholding account to the\npurchase of whole shares of Nuance common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nprovide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence\u037e and\n\u2022\nterminate the ESPP in its entirety, effective as of the effective time.\nAccelerated Vesting of Equity Compensation Upon Certain Terminations\nNone of the Nuance equity awards provide for \u201csingle trigger\u201d vesting immediately at the effective time (i.e., as a\nresult of the transaction with Microsoft without a termination of employment). However, under the terms of our\nequity incentive plans and the award agreements for the RSUs and PSUs (as such agreements may be amended in\naccordance with the terms of the merger agreement) and, for certain employees, individual employment or change of\ncontrol severance agreements, the vesting of the Rollover RSUs (i.e., the stock-based awards of Microsoft) that are\nconverted at the effective time from unvested RSUs and PSUs that were granted prior to the date of the merger\nagreement will accelerate on a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d basis on qualifying terminations of employment after the effective\ntime, as follows:\n\u2022\nAny such award held by an executive with the title of senior vice president or above (including our\nexecutive officers) who is a party to a change of control severance agreement will accelerate if, during the\none-year period immediately following the effective time, the executive\u2019s employment is terminated by the\nemployer without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for \u201cgood reason.\u201d\n\u2022\nAny such award held by an executive with the title of senior vice president or above who is not a party to a\nchange of control severance agreement will accelerate if, during the one-year period immediately following\nthe effective time, the executive\u2019s employment is terminated by the executive for \u201cgood reason.\u201d\n\u2022\nAny such award held by any employee (including our executive officers) will accelerate if, at any time\nbefore the award is scheduled to vest, the employee\u2019s employment is terminated by the employer without\n\u201ccause\u201d or due to the employee\u2019s resignation as a result of the employee\u2019s refusal to consent to a required\nrelocation of the employee\u2019s principal place of employment of more than 50 miles.\nInterests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Nuance in the Merger\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to\nadopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our non-employee directors and executive officers may have\ninterests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Nuance\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among\nother matters, in evaluating and overseeing the negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger\nagreement and the merger and in recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of\nNuance.\nValue of Shares and Equity Awards Held by Directors and Executive Officers\nThe estimated aggregate amount of the merger consideration payable with respect to Nuance shares held by our non-\nemployee directors and executive officers, as a group, assuming the merger closed on May 14, 2021, is approximately\n$90.5 million.\nThe estimated aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by our non-employee directors and executive officers,\nincluding our named executive officers, that would accelerate in connection with the merger, assuming the merger\nclosed on May 14, 2021, and, immediately thereafter, the director\u2019s service terminated, or the executive officer\u2019s\nemployment was terminated by the company without \u201ccause\u201d or the executive officer resigned for \u201cgood reason\u201d\n(each such term, as defined in the applicable agreement with Nuance) is approximately $5.2 million for our non-\nemployee directors, and approximately $228.2 million for our executive officers. These values do not include any new\nNuance equity awards that may be granted before the merger closes, as such awards will not have termination of\nemployment protections. These values are calculated based on the multiplying the number of shares underlying\nawards by the cash consideration (based on the maximum number of shares underlying the relative TSR PSUs and\ntarget number of shares underlying the financial metric PSUs). For estimates of the value of such unvested equity\nawards for each of our named executive officers individually, see below under \u201cGolden Parachute Compensation.\u201d\nPotential Payments to Executive Officers upon Termination in Connection with the Merger\nWe have entered into agreements with our executive officers, including our named executive officers, which would\nentitle the executives to severance payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in\nconnection with the merger:\n\u2022\nMr. Benjamin\u2019s executive employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by the\ncompany without \u201ccause\u201d or if he resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as each such term is defined in his\nagreement), in either case during the period beginning three months before and ending 12 months after a\nchange of control (which will occur at the effective time), he will be entitled to receive:\n\u25cb\na lump sum payment equal to 250% of his annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the\ntermination date or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to the change of control\u037e\n\u25cb\na lump sum payment equal to 200% of his target annual bonus for the year in which his termination\noccurs\u037e\n\u25cb\na pro-rated payment of his target annual bonus for the year of termination based on the percentage of\nthe fiscal year completed\u037e\n\u25cb\nfull vesting of his outstanding time-based equity awards (including any Rollover RSUs that are\nconverted from PSUs at the effective time, as described above under \u201cTreatment of Equity\nCompensation\u201d)\u037e and\n\u25cb\ncontinued company-paid health insurance coverage for 18 months for him and his eligible dependents.\n\u2022\nEach of our other executive officers (including our other named executive officers) has a change of control\nand severance agreement that provides that if within one year after a change of control (which will occur at\nthe effective time), the officer\u2019s employment is terminated by the company without \u201ccause\u201d or the officer\nresigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as each such term is defined in the agreement), the officer will be entitled to\nreceive:\n\u25cb\na lump sum payment equal to 12 months of base salary as in effect immediately prior to the termination\ndate or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to the change of control\u037e\n\u25cb\na lump sum payment equal to 100% of the greater of the executive\u2019s annual target bonus for the year\nof termination or the executive\u2019s target bonus in effect immediately prior to the change of control\u037e\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u25cb\nfull vesting of the officer\u2019s outstanding time-based equity awards (including any Rollover RSUs that\nare converted from PSUs at the effective time, as described above under \u201cTreatment of Equity\nCompensation\u201d)\u037e and\n\u25cb\ncontinued company-paid health insurance coverage for 12 months.\nAs a condition to receipt of the severance payments and benefits described above, each executive officer is required\nto execute a separation and release of claims agreement in favor of the company and its affiliates and to continue to\ncomply with certain post-termination covenants in favor of the company and its affiliates.\nThe estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance our executive officers, including our named executive officers,\nwould have received upon a qualifying termination of employment, assuming the merger closed on May 14, 2021, and\nthe qualifying termination occurred immediately thereafter, is approximately $10.3 million. For estimates of the\namounts of such cash severance that each of our named executive officers would have received individually, see\nbelow under \u201cGolden Parachute Compensation.\u201d\nThe employment agreement with Mr. Benjamin and the change of control and severance agreement with Mr.\nTempesta will be modified, effective upon the closing of the merger, as further described below under \u201cNew\nArrangements with Microsoft.\u201d\nFuture Nuance Equity Grants\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, we may continue to grant ordinary course equity awards, including annual\nawards to employees with the title of vice president or below on or about July 1, 2021 (with an aggregate value of up\nto $41.5 million), annual awards to employees with the title of senior vice president or above (including our executive\nofficers) on or about November 1, 2021 (with an aggregate value of up to $38 million), and awards to new hires (with\nan aggregate value of up to $7.4 million), in each case, if the effective time has not yet occurred. These awards will be\ngranted in the form of time-vesting RSUs that will not accelerate in connection with the merger or termination of\nemployment (whether occurring before or after the effective time). We may also make ordinary course annual awards\nto our non-employee directors in January 2022, if the effective time has not yet occurred, in the form of time-vesting\nRSUs (with a grant date value not to exceed $250,000 per director, as provided under our 2020 Stock Plan).\nSpecial Bonuses\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, we may grant special cash bonuses to employees (including our executive\nofficers) in an aggregate amount of up to $25 million and enter into agreements to provide for such bonuses. As of\nthe date of this proxy statement, no such bonuses have been granted.\nNew Arrangements with Microsoft\nCEO and CFO Letter Agreements with Microsoft\nThe following is a summary of the material terms of the letter agreements entered into on April 11, 2021, between each\nof Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta and Microsoft, in each case, subject to the closing of the merger:\n\u2022\nMessrs. Benjamin and Tempesta will continue to serve as Nuance\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, respectively\u037e\n\u2022\nMr. Benjamin will report to Scott Guthrie, Microsoft\u2019s Executive Vice President of Cloud + AI Group (or his\nsuccessor), and Mr. Tempesta will report to Mr. Benjamin (or, upon his death, his successor)\u037e\n\u2022\nTheir annual salaries and target annual bonuses will remain the same as currently in effect ($800,000 salary\nand target bonus of 150% of salary, for Mr. Benjamin\u037e $500,000 salary and target bonus of 75% of salary, for\nMr. Tempesta)\u037e\n\u2022\nFollowing the closing, Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta will be eligible for annual equity awards, with a\ntarget grant date value of $9,000,000 for Mr. Benjamin and $2,750,000 for Mr. Tempesta, with vesting and\nperformance terms similar to those applicable to similarly situated executives of Nuance, subject to any\nstub period as the equity grant cycles of Microsoft and Nuance are harmonized\u037e and\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nMr. Benjamin will be granted an on-hire performance stock award for shares of Microsoft common stock,\nwhich will be eligible to vest between 0% and 200% of target based on the achievement of performance\ngoals over four performance periods ending June 30, 2025. The number of shares underlying such award\nwill be equal to $15,000,000 divided by Microsoft\u2019s closing stock price as of the closing date.\nThe letter agreements also amend Mr. Benjamin\u2019s employment agreement and Mr. Tempesta\u2019s change of control and\nseverance agreement, as follows:\n\u2022\nThe employment and change of control and severance agreements will remain in effect until the third\nanniversary of the effective time, unless earlier terminated in accordance with their terms\u037e\n\u2022\nThe \u201cgood reason\u201d definitions in the employment and change of control severance agreements will be\nmodified, including to provide that the executives will not be considered to have an adverse change in\nduties or responsibilities that would constitute \u201cgood reason\u201d solely by reason of the merger or Nuance\nbecoming a subsidiary of Microsoft. Instead:\n\u25cb\nMr. Benjamin will have \u201cgood reason\u201d if he ceases to run the Nuance business unit reporting directly\nto Mr. Guthrie or his successor, as such business unit evolves based on Microsoft\u2019s additions to or\nsubtractions from the business unit from time to time\u037e and\n\u25cb\nMr. Tempesta will have \u201cgood reason\u201d if he is assigned duties and responsibilities that, in the\naggregate, are materially inconsistent with being a chief financial officer of an operating business of a\npublic company or if he ceases to report directly to Mr. Benjamin or his successor\u037e\n\u2022\nAny equity awards granted to either executive after the date of the letter agreement will not be subject to\nthe accelerated vesting provisions of the employment or change of control severance agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nEach executive will receive the severance payments and benefits provided under the employment or change\nof control severance agreement, and full vesting of the equity awards granted to each executive before the\ndate of the letter agreement on any of the following terminations of employment,:\n\u25cb\nif at any time on or following the effective time, the executive\u2019s employment is terminated by Microsoft\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in Microsoft\u2019s Senior Executive Severance Plan) or terminates due to the\nexecutive\u2019s death or disability\u037e\n\u25cb\nif on or within 12 months after the effective time, the executive resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as modified\npursuant to the letter agreement)\u037e or\n\u25cb\nif between the 12-month and three-year anniversaries of the effective time, the executive resigns for\nany reason.\n\u2022\nFollowing the third anniversary of the effective time, each executive will be eligible to participate in\nMicrosoft\u2019s severance plan applicable to similarly situated employees of Microsoft.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the estimated amounts of the payments\nand benefits that each named executive officer of Nuance would have received in connection with the merger,\nassuming the merger closed on May 14, 2021 and, immediately thereafter, the employment of the named executive\nofficer was terminated by the company without \u201ccause\u201d or the named executive officer resigned for \u201cgood reason\u201d\n(each such term, as defined in the applicable agreement with the named executive officer). This compensation is\nsubject to an advisory vote of Nuance\u2019s stockholders, as described below under the section entitled \u201cProposal 2:\nAdvisory Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements\u201d beginning on page 77.\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe calculations in the tables below do not include any new Nuance equity awards or special bonuses that may be\ngranted to the named executive officers before the merger closes. In addition to the assumptions regarding the\nclosing date of the merger and termination of the employment of the named executive officers, these estimates are\nbased on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the tables below. Accordingly,\nthe ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the\namounts set forth below.\nOfficer\nCash \n($)(1)\nEquity \n($)(2)\nPerquisites/\nBenefits \n($)(3)\nTotal \n($)\nMark Benjamin\n$5,143,014\n$99,975,904\n$46,063\n$105,164,981\nDaniel Tempesta\n$875,000\n$31,830,434\n$30,785\n$32,736,219\nRobert Dahdah\n$875,000\n$16,537,136\n$7,458\n$\u200b17,419,594\nJoseph Petro\n$875,000\n$27,822,122\n$23,442\n$28,720,563\nRobert Weideman\n$875,000\n$28,936,914\n$20,550\n$29,832,464\n(1)\nCash. The amounts in this column reflect the value of the cash severance payments payable to each named executive officer and,\nfor Mr. Benjamin, a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination. For Mr. Benjamin, his severance is equal to the sum of\n250% of his annual base salary plus 200% of his target bonus. For the other named executive officers, the severance is equal to\n100% of the officer\u2019s base salary and target bonus for the year of termination (or, if greater, the target bonus for the year of the\nmerger). The breakdown of the amounts in this column for Mr. Benjamin are $4,400,000 for severance and $743,014 for\nprorated annual bonus. The severance and prorated bonus payments are all \u201cdouble trigger\u201d in nature, which means that payment\nof these amounts is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment on or within the 12 months following the merger\n(except for Mr. Benjamin, upon a qualifying termination of employment three months prior to or within 12 months following\nthe merger).\n(2)\nEquity. The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate values of the accelerated vesting of the Rollover RSUs. These amounts\nare \u201cdouble trigger\u201d in nature, which means that the accelerated vesting is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of\nemployment on or after the merger (except for Mr. Benjamin, upon a qualifying termination of employment three months prior\nto or within 12 months following the merger). In connection with the merger, Mr. Benjamin will be entitled to receive a\nMicrosoft equity award with a number of shares underlying such award equal to $15,000,000, divided by Microsoft's closing stock\nprice as of the closing date, as described above under \u201cNew Arrangements with Microsoft\u201d. The equity award will be eligible to\nvest between 0% and 200% of target based on the achievement of performance goals over four performance periods ending June\n30, 2025, but this award does not provide for acceleration upon any termination of Mr. Benjamin\u2019s employment and is not\nincluded in this table.\n(3)\nPerquisites/Benefits. The amounts in this column reflect the value of continued company-paid health insurance coverage for 12\nmonths (except for Mr. Benjamin, coverage for 18 months). The amounts in this column are \u201cdouble trigger\u201d in nature, which\nmeans that payment of these amounts is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment on or within the 12 months\nfollowing the merger (except for Mr. Benjamin, upon a qualifying termination of employment three months prior to or within\n12 months following the merger).\nFinancing of the Merger\nThe merger is not conditioned on Microsoft\u2019s ability to obtain financing. Microsoft has represented to Nuance that it\nhas available and will have available at the effective time the funds necessary to pay the aggregate merger\nconsideration, including (i) payments to Nuance\u2019s stockholders of the amounts due under the merger agreement and\n(ii) payments in respect of certain of Nuance\u2019s outstanding equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S.\nholders (each as defined below) of Nuance common stock who hold their stock as a capital asset within the meaning\nof Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which we refer to as the Code. This summary is based on the\nCode, the U.S. Treasury Department regulations issued under the Code, which we refer to as the Treasury\nRegulations, and administrative rulings and court decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, all of\nwhich are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary is not binding on the Internal\nRevenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, or a court and there can be no assurance that the tax consequences\ndescribed in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or that they would be sustained by a court if so\nchallenged. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Nuance common stock that is for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or\nother entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the\nUnited States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is includible in gross\nincome for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if (A) a court within the United\nStates is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) the trust has a\nvalid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. A \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Nuance common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor\na partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThis summary is not a complete description of all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and, in\nparticular, may not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of Nuance common stock\nwho are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law including, for example, partnerships (or an\nentity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and partners therein, financial\ninstitutions, dealers in securities, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, mutual funds, real estate investment\ntrusts, personal holding companies, regulated investment companies, securities or currency dealers, traders in\nsecurities who elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting, non-U.S. holders that hold, directly or\nconstructively (or that held, directly or constructively, at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of\nthe merger), 5% or more of the outstanding Nuance common stock, tax-exempt investors, S corporations or other\npass-through entities, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-deferred or other retirement\naccounts, U.S. expatriates, former long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired Nuance common\nstock pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock option or right or otherwise as compensation, and holders who\nhold Nuance common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, or other\nintegrated investment. Also, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to\nholders of Nuance common stock who exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law. In addition, no information is\nprovided with respect to the tax consequences of the merger under any U.S. federal law other than income tax laws\n(including, for example the U.S. federal estate, gift, Medicare, and alternative minimum tax laws), or any applicable\nstate, local, or foreign tax laws. This summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than\nthe merger.\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Nuance common stock,\nthe tax treatment of a partner in such a partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership. Any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds\nNuance common stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult their own independent tax advisors\nregarding the tax consequences of the merger to their specific circumstances.\nThe tax consequences of the merger will depend on a holder\u2019s specific situation. Holders should consult their tax\nadvisor as to the tax consequences of the merger relevant to their particular circumstances, including the\napplicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes\nin those laws.\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder\nwho receives cash in exchange for shares of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize capital gain\nor loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the merger and (ii) the\nU.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Nuance common stock exchanged therefor.\nA U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Nuance common stock will generally equal the price the U.S. holder\npaid for such shares. If a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of Nuance common stock surrendered in the\nmerger is greater than one year as of the date of the merger, the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss.\nLong-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized on the exchange is subject to limitations.\nIf a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Nuance common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S.\nholder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Nuance\ncommon stock.\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\nPayments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger\ngenerally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain, if any, on such shares of Nuance common stock is effectively connected with a trade or business\nof the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is\nattributable to the non-U.S. holder\u2019s permanent establishment in the United States) in which case such gain\nwill generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates applicable to U.S. holders and, if such non-U.S.\nholder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a 30% rate (or\nlower applicable treaty rate)\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the\nexchange of shares of Nuance common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger and\ncertain other conditions are met, in which case the gain, if any, on such shares of Nuance common stock\nwill be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) and such gain may be offset by U.S.\nsource capital losses recognized in the same taxable year.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of cash to a U.S. holder of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger may, under certain circumstances,\nbe subject to backup withholding, unless the holder furnishes its taxpayer identification number, certifies that the\nnumber is correct, and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Certain\nholders (such as corporations and non-U.S. holders) are exempt from backup withholding. Cash received in the\nmerger will also be subject to information reporting unless an exemption applies.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be\nrefunded or credited against a holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the\nrequired information to the IRS in a timely manner. Non-U.S. holders may be required to comply with certification\nrequirements and identification procedures in order to establish an exemption from information reporting and backup\nwithholding.\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences described above are not intended to constitute a complete description of\nall tax consequences relating to the merger. Holders of Nuance common stock are urged to consult their own tax\nadvisors with respect to the tax consequences of the merger in their particular circumstances, including the\napplicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes\nin those laws.\nRegulatory Approvals\nGeneral\nNuance and Microsoft have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory filing and\nnotification requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required or recommended to consummate the merger\nand the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These approvals include approval under, or\nnotifications pursuant to, the HSR Act and the competition laws of the European Union and any relevant European\nUnion Member States, the United Kingdom and Australia.\nIn addition, each of Nuance and Microsoft have agreed to (1) cooperate and coordinate with each other to make such\nfilings\u037e (2) use its reasonable best efforts to supply the other with any information that may be required in order to\nmake such filings\u037e (3) use its reasonable best efforts to supply any additional information that reasonably may be\nrequested to obtain regulatory approvals\u037e (4) use its reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to obtain\nregulatory approvals as soon as practicable\u037e and (5) provide notice to the other party if it plans to participate in any\nmaterial meeting or substantive conversation with respect to the merger.\nIf and to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the merger, Microsoft, Sub and, solely to the extent\nrequested by Microsoft, Nuance will (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order\nor otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,\nproducts or businesses of Nuance (whether directly or by the disposition of the capital stock or other equity or\nvoting interest in the entities in which such assets, rights, products or businesses are held)\u037e and\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(B) any other restrictions on the activities of the Nuance\u037e and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal proceedings,\nwhether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Microsoft is not required to offer, negotiate, commit to, effect or otherwise take any\naction with respect to Nuance that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,\nassets, liabilities, financial condition or results of the operations of Nuance. Microsoft is also not required to offer,\nnegotiate, commit to, effect or otherwise take any action with respect to its business if taking such action would\nreasonably be expected to (1) have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived from the merger by\nMicrosoft or (2) have more than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Microsoft and its\nsubsidiaries.\nHSR Act and Other Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the merger cannot be completed until Nuance and\nMicrosoft file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission, which we refer to as the \u201cFTC,\u201d and\nthe Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the \u201cDOJ,\u201d under the HSR Act and the\napplicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be\ncompleted until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filing of their respective HSR\nAct notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. The DOJ or the FTC may extend the 30 day\nwaiting period by issuing a Request for Additional Information and documentary materials (also known as a Second\nRequest). If either agency issues a Second Request, the waiting period is extended until 30 days after the parties\nsubstantially comply with the request.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems\nnecessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate\nexisting relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and\nnotwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the\nantitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin\nthe completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek\nto take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nForeign Competition Laws\nNuance and Microsoft conduct business in Member States of the European Union. Council Regulation (EC) No.\n139/2004, as amended, and accompanying regulations allow parties to ask the European Commission to review\nmergers and acquisitions that trigger national merger control filing requirements in at least three European Union\nMember States. The parties will file such a referral request as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable following\nwhich competent Member States have 15 working days to object to the referral. In the event that there is no such\nobjection, the transaction will be reviewable by the European Commission and the parties will then file a formal\nnotification of the merger with the European Commission as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable.\nPursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004, the European Commission has 25 business days from the day\nfollowing the date of receipt of a complete notification, which period may be extended to 35 business days under\ncertain circumstances, in which to consider whether the merger would significantly impede effective competition in\nthe common market (as defined by European Community regulations) or a substantial part of it, in particular as a\nresult of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position. By the end of that period, the European Commission\nmust issue a decision either clearing the merger, which may be conditional upon the parties offering suitable\nremedies, or opening an in-depth \u201cPhase II\u201d investigation. A Phase II investigation lasts for 90 business days, which\nmay be extended by an additional 35 business days under certain circumstances. At the end of the Phase II\ninvestigation the European Commission may either unconditionally approve the merger, conditionally approve the\nmerger subject to remedies or prohibit the merger if no adequate remedies have been proposed by Microsoft. The\nmerger cannot be completed during the European Commission\u2019s review of the merger.\nIn the event that a competent Member State of the European Union objects to the referral to the European\nCommission requested by the parties, the merger agreement contemplates that the necessary clearances, approvals or\ndecisions under the national competition laws of Austria, Germany, Denmark, Spain and Portugal (to the extent filings\nin such jurisdictions are required) will be conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the merger.\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe completion of the merger is also subject to obtaining a favorable outcome from the UK\u2019s Competition and\nMarkets Authority, which we refer to as the CMA. Such an outcome can take the form of either (i) the CMA\nindicating that it has no further questions about the merger in response to a briefing paper submitted by the parties\u037e\nor (ii) if a formal notification is made, the CMA approving the merger unconditionally or conditional upon adequate\nremedies being offered.\nIf a formal notification is made, the CMA has 40 business days in which to complete its initial review (Phase I), at the\nend of which it must confirm whether it believes that the merger results in a realistic prospect of a substantial\nlessening of competition. If so, the merger must be referred to an in-depth review (Phase II), unless adequate\nremedies are offered by the parties within 5 working days of the CMA\u2019s Phase I decision. Where Phase I remedies are\noffered, the CMA must decide whether to accept the remedies \u201cin principle\u201d within 10 working days of the Phase I\ndecision and must take a final decision on whether to accept the remedies within 50 working days of the Phase I\ndecision, subject to a possible 40 working day extension at the CMA\u2019s discretion. If a Phase II investigation is\nlaunched, the CMA has 24 weeks, extendable by up to eight weeks at the CMA\u2019s discretion if it considers there are\nspecial reasons for doing so, to decide if the merger should be prohibited or approved conditional on remedies.\nThe completion of the merger is also subject to certain notifications and/or approvals in accordance with the\ncompetition laws of Australia. The parties must also observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary\napprovals, clearances or consents in the required foreign jurisdictions before completing the merger.\nThe parties will file merger notifications with the appropriate regulators in each of the required foreign jurisdictions as\npromptly as practicable and work cooperatively toward expedited regulatory clearances.\nForeign Direct Investment Laws\nCompletion of the merger is further subject to receipt of certain other foreign direct investment review approvals,\nincluding notification, clearance and/or expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period in certain specified\ncountries.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nOne or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it\ngrants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory\nprocess or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even\npreclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain\nall of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a\nsubstantial period of time between the approval by Nuance stockholders and the completion of the merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that\nthese regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these\nregulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the\nmerger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the\nconditions to the merger not being satisfied.\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT",

The descriptions of the\nmerger agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and\nin its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement that is\nimportant to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger\nagreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by Nuance, Microsoft and Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the\nmerger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those\ngenerally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential\nmatters disclosed to Microsoft and Sub by Nuance in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the\nrepresentations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating\ncontractual risk between Nuance, Microsoft and Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject\nto standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the\nrepresentations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in\nwhich a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and\nwarranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise. Nuance\nstockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the\nactual state of facts or condition of Nuance, Microsoft or Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses.\nMoreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the\ndate of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or\nwarranty may have been included in this proxy statement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the\nmerger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Nuance, Microsoft and Sub, because the\nparties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the\nmerger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior\nnotice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with\ninformation regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding\nNuance, Microsoft, Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and\nother agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided\nelsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Nuance and our business.",

Our executive officers hold RSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of\nNuance common stock based on service over a time-based vesting schedule, and PSUs, which represent a right to\nreceive shares of Nuance common stock ranging from 0% to 200% of the target number of shares based on both\nservice and achievement of performance goals for a specified performance period. Our non-employee directors hold\nRSUs and DSUs, which represents a right to receive shares of Nuance common stock, subject to vesting\nrequirements of the underlying equity award, on a specified future date or event, such as separation from service. Our\nexecutive officers and non-employee directors do not hold stock options. The merger agreement provides for the\ntreatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity awards:\nStock Options\nEach stock option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration for each share of Nuance common stock\nthat would have been issuable upon exercise of the option, less the exercise price of the option and any applicable\nwithholding taxes. If the exercise price of a stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the\noption will be cancelled as of the effective time for no consideration.\nStock Units\n\u2022\nEach award of stock units that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the effective time or that will\nbecome vested by its terms at the effective time and, in each case, by its terms is to be settled upon the\noccurrence of vesting or the effective time will, as of the effective time, be deemed to be vested and will be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes.\n60TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nEach outstanding and unvested award of stock units will, as of the effective time, be converted into a\nRollover RSU as follows:\n\u25cb\nEach RSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that is subject to the same time-based vesting\nschedule as the RSU.\n\u25cb\nEach PSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that, following the effective time, will vest based\nsolely on time at the conclusion of the original performance period of the PSU.\n\u25cb\nThe number of shares of common stock of Microsoft subject to each Rollover RSU will be equal to the\nproduct (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of Nuance shares of common stock\nsubject to the corresponding RSU or PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by a\nspecified exchange ratio (see below). The number of Nuance shares of common stock subject to each\nPSU immediately prior to the effective time will be determined based on (i) maximum performance, for\nany PSU that was subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, and (ii) target\nperformance, for any PSU that was subject to financial and/or operational performance goals. For each\nPSU that is subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, Nuance is currently\nperforming at a level that would result in maximum performance payout.\n\u25cb\nNotwithstanding the treatment of awards of outstanding and unvested stock units described above,\nMicrosoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and\nconverting an award into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes).\n\u2022\nIf the treatment described above of an award of stock units held by a non-U.S. employee would be\nprohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the\napplicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance), Microsoft will\nprovide compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have\nbeen provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and as would\nnot result in the imposition of additional taxes under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. This\ncompensation will be provided in the form of a cash payment (less any applicable taxes) or a new equity\naward, as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance.\n\u2022\nFor purposes of the conversion of Nuance stock units described above, the \u201cexchange ratio\u201d is defined as\na fraction, the numerator of which is the merger consideration and the denominator of which is the volume\nweighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above\nrounded up) of Microsoft common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending with the\nlast trading day immediately prior to the closing.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn accordance with the plan terms, each ESPP participant in the current offering period, which began on February 16,\n2021, may not increase his or her payroll contribution rate or make separate non-payroll contributions, and no new\nparticipants may enroll in the current offering period. In connection with the transaction with Microsoft, Nuance will\ntake all actions necessary to provide that:\n\u2022\nif the closing occurs prior to August 13, 2021, which is the last day of the current offering period:\n\u25cb\ncause the current offering period to terminate no later than five business days prior to the closing\ndate\u037e\n\u25cb\nmake any pro-rata adjustments necessary to reflect the shortened offering period\u037e and\n\u25cb\ncause the exercise (as of no later than one business day before the effective time) of each outstanding\npurchase right and apply the funds credited to each participant\u2019s payroll withholding account to the\npurchase of whole shares of Nuance common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nprovide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence\u037e and\n\u2022\nterminate the ESPP in its entirety, effective as of the effective time.\n61\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExchange and Payment Procedures",

The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not\nconstitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of\nrecord of shares of Nuance common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that\nholder\u2019s name. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d or a \u201cholder of shares\u201d are to the\nrecord holder of shares unless otherwise noted. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Nuance common\nstock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to\ncause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal\nrights. If you hold your shares of Nuance common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to\nexercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, holders of shares of Nuance common stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the merger proposal\u037e\n(ii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time\u037e and (iii) otherwise follow the\nprocedures set forth in, and do not otherwise withdraw or lose their rights under, Section 262 will be entitled to have\ntheir shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive in lieu of the merger\nconsideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of the\nshares of Nuance common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of\nthe merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the court\n(subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the surviving corporation\npursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). Unless the Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines\notherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the\neffective date of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period\u037e provided that, if at any time before the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the surviving corporation\npays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment\nonly on the amount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d\nof the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and (ii) any interest accrued prior to\nthe time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to\nmake such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal\nshould be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more\nthan, the same as or less than the $56.00 per share consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement if they\ndid not seek appraisal of their shares.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal\nrights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement\nconstitutes Nuance\u2019s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and\nthe full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B. In connection with the merger, any holder\nof shares of Nuance\u2019s common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such\nholder\u2019s right to do so should review Annex B carefully. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a\ntimely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. In addition, assuming our shares\nremain listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time (which we expect to be the\ncase), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Nuance stockholders who assert\nappraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of Nuance common stock for which appraisal rights have been\npursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Nuance common stock measured in accordance with\nsubsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (ii) the value of the aggregate merger consideration in respect of the\nshares of Nuance common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. We\nrefer to these requirements as\n80TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe ownership conditions. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of\nshares of Nuance common stock, Nuance believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising appraisal rights, that\nstockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel. A stockholder who loses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be\nentitled to receive the merger consideration as described in the merger agreement upon surrender of the certificates\nthat formerly represented such shares of Nuance common stock.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Nuance common stock must fully\ncomply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Nuance a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger\nproposal at the special meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the\neffective time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the\neffective time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder (or a beneficial owner of shares on whose behalf the stockholder demanded appraisal) or\nthe surviving corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware requesting a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective date of the merger.

            "text": "Filing Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of Nuance common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Nuance, before\nthe vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s\nshares, and that stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal either in person or by proxy. A holder of\nshares of Nuance common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written\ndemand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time. A proxy that\nis submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger proposal,\nand it will cause a stockholder to lose the stockholder\u2019s right to appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered\nwritten demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the merger proposal or abstain from voting on the\nmerger proposal. However, neither voting against the merger proposal nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on\nthe merger proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of\nSection 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the\nmerger proposal. A proxy or vote against the merger proposal will not constitute a demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to\nmake the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting will cause the\nstockholder to lose its appraisal rights in connection with the merger.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Nuance common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares\nregistered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Nuance common stock should be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Nuance of the identity of the holder and\nstate that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the merger. If the\nshares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as\nin a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An\nauthorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on\nbehalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that,\nin executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of record, such as a\nbrokerage, bank or other nominee, who holds shares of Nuance common stock as nominee or intermediary for others\nmay exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of Nuance common stock held for one or more beneficial owners\nwhile not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the\nnumber of shares of Nuance common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Nuance\ncommon stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Nuance common stock\nheld in the name of the holder of record.\n81TABLE OF CONTENTS\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE\nFORMS, AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BROKERS,\nBANKS AND OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR\nTHE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE\nSHARES.

A beneficial owner of\nshares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a\npetition for appraisal. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The\nsurviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and holders should\nnot assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair values\nof shares of Nuance common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Nuance common stock who desire to have\ntheir shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware should assume that they will be responsible\nfor filing a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in the manner prescribed in\nSection 262.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of Nuance common stock who has\ncomplied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, or a beneficial owner of shares held either in a\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nsurviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger\nproposal and with respect to which Nuance received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of\nsuch shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after\nreceipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of\ndemands for appraisal, whichever is later.\n82TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Nuance common stock and a copy thereof is served\nupon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to\nfile with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders\nwho have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not\nbeen reached. We refer to this below as the verified list. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those\nstockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The\nCourt of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock\ncertificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any\nstockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the\nproceedings. In addition, assuming Nuance common stock remains listed on a national securities exchange\nimmediately prior to the effective time (which we expect to be the case), the Court of Chancery is required to dismiss\nthe appraisal proceedings as to all holders of dissenting shares unless one of the ownership conditions is satisfied.\nDetermination of Fair Value",

            "text": "Determination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Nuance common stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery of the State of\nDelaware will appraise the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Nuance common stock, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the\namount determined to be the fair value. The appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of\nthe Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. In determining fair value, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the\nSupreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal\nproceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in\nthe financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously\nrequires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d Section 262 provides that fair value\nis to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede &\nCo. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does\nnot encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising\nfrom such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements\nof future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nmerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by\nthe Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they\nwould receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an\ninvestment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is\nnot an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although\nNuance believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of\nfair value as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and stockholders should recognize that\nsuch an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger\nconsideration. Neither Nuance nor Microsoft anticipates offering more than the $56.00 per share consideration to any\nstockholder of Nuance exercising appraisal rights. Each of Nuance and Microsoft reserves the right to assert, in any\nappraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Nuance common stock is less\nthan the $56.00 per share consideration.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or by any holder of shares of Nuance common stock entitled to\nparticipate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may, in its discretion, proceed\nto trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any holder of\nshares of Nuance common stock whose name appears on the verified list and, if such shares are represented by\ncertificates and if so required, who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of Nuance common stock to the\nDelaware Register in Chancery, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such\nstockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair\nvalue of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto.\nPayment will be made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of\n83TABLE OF CONTENTS\nuncertificated stock, forthwith, and in the case of holders of shares represented by certificates, upon the surrender to\nthe surviving corporation of the certificate(s) representing such stock. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may\nbe enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.\nUnless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded\nquarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from\ntime to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment\u037e\nprovided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware enters judgment in the appraisal\nproceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will\naccrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\nand (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving\ncorporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. The costs\nof the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be\ndetermined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery of\nthe State of Delaware deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in\nconnection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Nuance common stock under Section 262 fails to\nperfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of Nuance\ncommon stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time into the right to receive the merger\nconsideration less applicable withholding taxes. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the\nholder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, if\nneither of the ownership conditions is satisfied or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written\nwithdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger consideration in accordance with\nSection 262.\nFrom and after the effective time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Nuance\ncommon stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except\ndividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of Nuance common stock, if any, payable to stockholders of\nNuance of record as of a time prior to the effective time\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed,\nor if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an\nacceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written\napproval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal\nis filed with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed\nas to any stockholder of Nuance without the approval of the court\u037e provided that this provision will not affect the\nright of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party\nto withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days\nafter the effective date of the merger.\nFailure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory\nappraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder of Nuance wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to\nconsult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\n84\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS",

If the certificate of incorporation contains such a\nprovision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this\nsection, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.\n(d)\nAppraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\n(1)\nIf a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to\nbe submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to\nthe meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such\nmeeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with \u00a7 255(c) of this title) with respect to\nshares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that\nappraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall\ninclude in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock\ncorporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title.

Such demand will be sufficient if\nit reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder\nintends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. A proxy or vote against the\nmerger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such\naction must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective\ndate of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each\nstockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted\nin favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation\nhas become effective\u037e or\n(2)\nIf the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \u00a7 228, \u00a7 251(h), \u00a7 253, or \u00a7 267 of this title,\nthen either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the\nsurviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any\nclass or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the\napproval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of\nsuch class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy\nof this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of\nthis title.

Any\nstockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in\nthe case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation\nof the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice,\ndemand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e\nprovided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to\nan information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such\ndemand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and\nthat the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If such notice\ndid not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such\nconstituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent\ncorporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or\n(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or\nwithin 10 days after such effective date\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more\nthan 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to\n\u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of\nthis title\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each\nstockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s\nshares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the\ntransfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given\nshall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of\ndetermining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in\nadvance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given,\nprovided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the\nrecord date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the\neffective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on\nwhich the notice is given.\n(e)\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting\ncorporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and\nwho is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in\nthe Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding\nas a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept\nthe terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this\nsection hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be\nentitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement\nsetting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the\ncase of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any\nexcluded stock (as defined in \u00a7 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered\ninto, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with\nrespect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such\nshares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request\nfor such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration\nof the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is\nlater. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such\nstock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own\nname, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f)\nUpon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the\nsurviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the\nRegister in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses\nof all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the\nvalue of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall\nbe filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified\nlist. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the\nhearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the\nstockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more\npublications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published\nin the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the\nnotices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by\nthe surviving or resulting corporation.\n(g)\nAt the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this\nsection and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who\nhave demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their\ncertificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal\nproceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the\nproceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the\nB-3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are\navailable were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all\nholders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares\nentitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2)\nthe value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares\nexceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h)\nAfter the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the\nshares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or\nconsolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In\ndetermining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its\ndiscretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest\nfrom the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded\nquarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of\npayment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving\ncorporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest\nshall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore\naccrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any\nstockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to\ntrial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any\nstockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to\nsubsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the\nRegister in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined\nthat such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i)\nThe Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each\nsuch stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares\nrepresented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such\nstock. The Court\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,\nwhether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.\n(j)\nThe costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court\ndeems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a\nportion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,\nincluding, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be\ncharged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.\n(k)\nFrom and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded\nappraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any\npurpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided\nin subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting\ncorporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the\nmerger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as\nprovided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then\nthe right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal\nproceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the\nCourt, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just\u037e provided, however\nthat this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has\nB-4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnot commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation\nwithin 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this\nsection.\n(l)\nThe shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders\nwould have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-5\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nANNEX C\n \nApril 9, 2021\nThe Board of Directors\nNuance Communications, Inc. \n1 Wayside Road\nBurlington, Massachusetts 01803\nMembers of the Board of Directors:\nWe understand that Nuance Communications, Inc.

Samuels\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nIn accordance with Section 6.18(c) of the Merger Agreement, entered into on April 11, 2021, by and among Microsoft\nCorporation, a Washington corporation (\u201cMicrosoft\u201d), Big Sky Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Microsoft (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), and Nuance Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation\n(\u201cNuance\u201d), we have been asked to make certain representations and certifications in connection with the delivery of\nthe tax opinion described therein (the \u201cOpinion\u201d). This letter is being provided to you pursuant to that agreement.\nExcept as otherwise provided, all \u201cSection\u201d references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\u201cCode\u201d), and all \u201cTreasury Regulations Section\u201d references are to the Treasury regulations promulgated under the\nCode. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Opinion.\nAs used herein, \u201cknowledge of Nuance,\u201d means the actual knowledge of the undersigned, and the knowledge that\nthe undersigned would have reasonably obtained after due inquiry with respect to the particular matter in question.\nThe undersigned hereby certifies and represents on behalf of Nuance that, after due inquiry and investigation, the\nfollowing facts and representations are true, correct, and complete in all respects as of the date hereof.\n1.\nThe undersigned is familiar with the matters set forth in the Opinion, and has made such investigations of\nfactual matters as the undersigned deemed reasonably necessary for the purpose of making the representations,\ncovenants and statements therein.\n2.\nThe facts that are set forth in the section entitled \u201cBackground of the Merger and Reasons for the Merger\u201d in\nthe Registration Statement, which includes the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission, as amended or supplemented through the date hereof (the \u201cForm S-4\u201d), insofar as such\nfacts pertain to Nuance or its representatives, are true, correct and complete in all material respects.\n3.\nBeginning in the fall of 2017, Nuance initiated a formal process (the \u201c2017 Sale Process\u201d) to evaluate potential\noffers for its automotive solutions business, specifically the business that would ultimately be spun off as\nCerence Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cCerence\u201d). The process included the engagement of Evercore Group\nL.L.C. (\u201cEvercore\u201d) as a sell side banker. The process resulted in an offer from a third party other than Microsoft\n(\u201cParty A\u201d) to acquire 51% of Cerence at a valuation of $1.35 billion. The process was put on hold on or around\nMarch 12, 2018 pending the leadership change at Nuance.\n4.\nDuring the summer of 2018, Evercore reengaged previously contacted and new potential investors (the \u201c2018\nSale Process\u201d). In total, considering both the 2017 Sale Process and the 2018 Sale Process, Evercore contacted\n41 parties, including Microsoft, in connection with the sale of this business. The 2018 Sale Process resulted in\nindications of interest from Party A as well as two other third parties other than Microsoft at valuation levels\ndeemed insufficient to proceed with a sale.\nA-A-1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n5.\nIn October, 2018, prior to the decision to spin off Nuance\u2019s automotive solutions business, Marc Brown, the\nthen Global Head of Corporate Development for Microsoft, was contacted regarding a potential minority\ninvestment in Nuance\u2019s automotive solutions business. Then, Marc Brown checked with Microsoft\u2019s relevant\nproduct team internally, and since no one had interest in exploring such investment, Microsoft did not further\npursue investment discussions.\n6.\nEfforts to sell an equity stake in Cerence highlighted that the valuation attributed to Cerence by the private\nmarket was likely lower than what could be achieved in the public market. By September, 2018, Nuance\nmanagement came to believe that separating Cerence via a spin-off would maximize long-term value creation to\nNuance\u2019s shareholders and given the corporate business purposes described below in representation 8.\n7.\nAt a September, 2018 board meeting, the Nuance board directed management to commence work in support of a\nrequest for the Nuance board\u2019s formal approval to proceed with a spin-off of Cerence. Neither the 2017 Sale\nProcess nor the 2018 Sale Process contemplated a sale of the entire business of Nuance.\n8.\nThe Distribution was undertaken for the following corporate business purposes:\na.\u2003Enhanced Strategic and Operational Focus. Following the Distribution, Nuance and Cerence would each\nhave a more focused business and would be better able to dedicate financial, management and other resources\nto their respective areas of strength and differentiation. Each company would pursue growth opportunities and\nexecute strategic plans best suited to address the distinct market trends and opportunities for its business.\nGiven that the Cerence business was the only Nuance business primarily focused on the automotive technology\nindustry, Cerence would be better positioned as an independent company to channel properly and fund\ninvestments and develop partnerships to capitalize on long-term industry trends. Cerence would focus on\nautomotive technology industry growth areas as well as continued operational excellence. The Nuance board\nbelieved that Cerence\u2019s separation from Nuance would allow Nuance to focus on the core growth opportunities\nin the remaining Nuance business.\nb.\u2003Simplified Organizational Structure and Resources. The Distribution would allow the management of each of\nNuance and Cerence to devote their time and attention to the development and implementation of corporate\nstrategies and policies that are based on the specific company\u2019s business characteristics. Each company would\nbe able to adapt faster to customers\u2019 changing needs, address specific market dynamics, target innovation and\ninvestments in select growth areas and accelerate decision-making processes.\nc.\u2003Distinct and Clear Financial Profiles and Compelling Investment Cases. Investment in one company or the\nother may appeal to investors with different goals, interests and concerns. The Distribution would allow\ninvestors to make independent investment decisions with respect to Nuance and Cerence and would result in\ngreater alignment between the interests of Cerence\u2019s stockholder base and the characteristics of Cerence\u2019s\nbusiness, capital structure and financial results.\nd.\u2003Performance Incentives. The Nuance board believed that the Distribution would enable Cerence to create\nincentives for its management and employees that would be more closely tied to its business performance and\nstockholder expectations. Cerence\u2019s equity-based compensation arrangements would more closely align the\ninterests of Cerence\u2019s management and employees with the interests of its stockholders and would increase\nCerence\u2019s ability to attract and retain personnel.\ne.\u2003Capital Structure. The Distribution would enable each of Nuance and Cerence to leverage its distinct growth\nprofile and cash flow characteristics to optimize its capital structure and capital allocation strategy.\n9.\nFollowing the September, 2018 board meeting, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d) was engaged to\nadvise Nuance along with Evercore. Evercore and Goldman Sachs solicited a pre-spin minority investment in\nCerence from strategic investors and select financial sponsors. It was ultimately decided to proceed with a spin-\noff of Cerence to the public with no pre-spin minority investment in Cerence from a strategic investor or financial\nsponsor and all discussions with potential minority investors were terminated by November, 2018 and not\nresumed for the following reasons: (i) automotive technology peer trading multiples implied a higher public\nmarket valuation for Cerence than that attributed to a controlling equity stake in Cerence by financial sponsors\nor strategic investors, (ii) a spin-off could unlock value not then\nA-A-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreflected in the Nuance market valuation and (iii) a spin-off would create a public currency for Nuance to\nfacilitate management incentives and acquisitions. However, Nuance ultimately sold a 1.8% stake in Cerence on\nSeptember 30, 2019 in exchange for fair market value consideration to a non-strategic third-party investor.\n10.\nThe Distribution occurred on October 1, 2019. At that time, (i) Nuance had no plan or intention to approve, or\neffect, a transfer of any of its shares after the Distribution and (ii) Nuance had no current plan to redeem or\notherwise repurchase, directly or through any Affiliate, any of its outstanding stock, or rights to acquire stock,\nafter the Distribution, other than through purchases meeting the requirements of Section 4.05(1)(b) of Revenue\nProcedure 96-30 (without regard to the effect of Revenue Procedure 2003-48 on Revenue Procedure 96-30).\n11.\nTo the knowledge of Nuance, at the time of the Distribution there was no plan or intention on the part of any\nshareholder of Nuance, and neither the board nor the management of Nuance was aware of any plan or intention\non the part of any particular shareholder of Nuance, to dispose of any Nuance stock, other than in connection\nwith ordinary market trading.\n12.\nAt no time in the two years prior to the Distribution and for one year following the Distribution did any of\nNuance, any subsidiary in which Nuance owns a fifty percent or greater interest (together with Nuance, the\n\u201cNuance Group\u201d), any of their respective officers or directors, any person acting on behalf of the Nuance Group,\nor any person acting with the explicit or implicit permission, of any of the above (other than any person treated\nas acting with the implicit permission of Nuance solely in Nuance\u2019s capacity as a shareholder of such person\nand solely pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(9)) or, to the knowledge of Nuance, any five-\npercent shareholder (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(8)) of Nuance or any group of\nshareholders together owning five-percent of Nuance, or any person acting on behalf of or with the explicit or\nimplicit permission of any five-percent Nuance shareholder, reach any agreement, understanding, or\narrangement, or conduct any substantial negotiations, each as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-\n7(h)(1), or discussions, as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(6), in each case with Microsoft,\nany Microsoft officer or director, any five-percent shareholder (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-\n7(h)(8)) of Microsoft, any group of shareholders together owning five-percent of Microsoft, or otherwise with\nany person acting on behalf of Microsoft or any five-percent Microsoft shareholder or any person acting with\nthe explicit or implicit permission of Microsoft or any five percent Microsoft shareholder, with respect to a\ntransaction or a proposed transaction pursuant to which any member of the Microsoft Group would (directly or\nindirectly) acquire, or have the right to acquire, the stock of Nuance or any interest in the assets that currently\nconstitute the Nuance business.\n13.\nAt no time since the date of the Distribution has Nuance been a disqualified investment corporation (within the\nmeaning of Section 355(g)(2) of the Code).\n14.\nThe potential acquisition by Microsoft of the stock of Nuance is not pursuant to an arrangement negotiated or\nagreed upon during any period before the Distribution, and no enforceable rights to acquire the stock of Nuance\nexisted during any period prior to the Distribution.\n15.\nThe total value of Microsoft\u2019s current offer to Nuance as of the date the Nuance board approved the\nTransaction was approximately $19.6 billion, computed on a fully-diluted basis, and accounting for payments to\nall Nuance equityholders in connection with the Transaction. Microsoft\u2019s current offer reflects a valuation of the\nNuance business that was not, and, in our view, could not have been, expected at the time of the Distribution.\n16.\nThe Transaction will be effected pursuant to, and in accordance with, the material terms and conditions of the\nMerger Agreement and none of the material terms and conditions thereof have been or will be waived or\nmodified. The facts relating to the Transaction as described in the Opinion and the documents referenced therein\nare true, correct, and complete in all material respects.\n17.\nUnless otherwise required by a court of competent jurisdiction, Nuance will not take (and will not cause its\nsubsidiaries to take) any position on any U.S. federal, state, or local income or franchise tax return, or any other\ntax reporting position, that is inconsistent with any statement or representation set forth in the Opinion or the\ntreatment of the Transaction described in the Opinion.

Then, Marc Brown checked with Microsoft\u2019s relevant\nproduct team internally, and since no one had interest in exploring such investment, Microsoft did not further\npursue investment discussions.\n5.\nNo member of the Microsoft Group currently owns, or at any time in the past has owned, a one-percent or\ngreater interest in Nuance, or any of its predecessor entities.\n6.\nTo the knowledge of Microsoft, after due inquiry based on publicly available information and internal schedules\nof Microsoft, and based on an analysis of institutional investors, executive officers and directors of Microsoft,\nthere are no \u201ccontrolling shareholders\u201d of Microsoft, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-\n7(h)(3) other than the persons named on Schedule A hereto.\n7.\nThe potential acquisition by Microsoft of the stock of Nuance is not pursuant to an arrangement negotiated or\nagreed upon during any period before the Distribution, and no enforceable rights to acquire the stock of Nuance\nexisted during any period prior to the Distribution.\n8.\nMicrosoft\u2019s decision to acquire Nuance was motivated by, among other factors, the ongoing strategic\nrelationship between Microsoft and Nuance, Nuance\u2019s team and businesses, as well as our shared vision to\nenhance cloud innovations in healthcare and in other industry verticals. By augmenting the Microsoft\u2019s Cloud\nfor Healthcare with Nuance\u2019s solutions, as well as the benefit of Nuance\u2019s expertise and relationships with EHR\nsystems providers, Microsoft will be better able to empower healthcare providers through the power of ambient\nclinical intelligence and other Microsoft cloud services. Nuance\u2019s expertise will come together with the breadth\nand depth of Microsoft\u2019s cloud to deliver next-generation customer engagement and security solutions.\n9.\nMembers of the Microsoft Group have no current plans to discontinue the active conduct of the Healthcare\nBusiness (i.e., the provision of clinical speech and clinical language understanding solutions) or the Enterprise\nBusiness (the provision of automated customer solutions and services worldwide to aid enterprises with their\ncustomer service and engagement).\n10.\nThe Transaction will be effected pursuant to, and in accordance with, the material terms and conditions of the\nMerger Agreement and none of the material terms and conditions thereof have been or will be waived or\nmodified.
