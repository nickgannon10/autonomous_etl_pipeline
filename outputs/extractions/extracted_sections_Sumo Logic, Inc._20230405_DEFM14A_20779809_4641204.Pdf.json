These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to\nyou. We encourage you to carefully read the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement,\nincluding the annexes to this proxy statement and the other documents to which we refer in this proxy statement. You\nmay obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the\ninstructions in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\nA:\nOn February 9, 2023, we announced that Sumo Logic entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger\nagreement, Parent will acquire Sumo Logic for $12.05 in cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock. In order to\ncomplete the merger, Sumo Logic\u2019s stockholders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of\nSumo Logic common stock as of the record date must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.\nThis approval is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.\u201d The Sumo Logic Board is\nfurnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock in\nconnection with the solicitation of proxies of Sumo Logic\u2019s stockholders to be voted at the special meeting.\nThis proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the\nmerger agreement, the special meeting, and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed\nmaterials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of Sumo Logic common stock without attending the\nspecial meeting and to ensure that your shares of Sumo Logic common stock are represented and voted at the\nspecial meeting.\nYour vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy\nas soon as possible.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Sumo Logic?\nA:\nThe proposed merger is the acquisition of Sumo Logic by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\nis approved by Sumo Logic\u2019s stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are\nsatisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Sumo Logic, with Sumo Logic continuing as the\nsurviving corporation.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement.\nThis chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Sumo Logic Board, its\ncommittees, its representatives or other parties.\nThe Sumo Logic Board regularly evaluates Sumo Logic\u2019s strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view\ntoward strengthening Sumo Logic\u2019s business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the Sumo\nLogic Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These have included, among others,\n(1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, Sumo Logic\u2019s current business plan, with Sumo Logic\nremaining an independent entity\u037e (2) potential expansion opportunities through acquisitions, partnerships or other\ncommercial relationships\u037e (3) various capital raising alternatives\u037e and (4) other financial and strategic alternatives,\nincluding the sale of Sumo Logic.\nIn September 2020, Sumo Logic completed its initial public offering at a price of $22.00 per share of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock. Following its initial public offering, Sumo Logic experienced a variety of challenges to executing on its\nstrategic plan, which challenges continued into the second half of 2022. These challenges contributed to volatility in\nthe trading price of Sumo Logic common stock. By early June 2022, Sumo Logic common stock had declined to\napproximately $8.00 per share from a high of approximately $40.00 per share in February 2021. In addition, by June\n2022, the Sumo Logic Board had heard from several Sumo Logic stockholders regarding their concerns with Sumo\nLogic\u2019s stock price, growth, path to profitability and strategy.\nOn June 3, 2022, representatives of Francisco Partners contacted Charles Robel, Sumo Logic\u2019s lead independent\ndirector, to request a meeting. The representatives of Francisco Partners did not specify the subject matter for the\nrequested meeting.\nOn June 6, 2022, and prior to any meeting with Mr. Robel, representatives of Francisco Partners informed Mr. Robel\nthat Francisco Partners would be submitting a proposal to acquire Sumo Logic. Later that day, Francisco Partners\nprovided Sumo Logic with a non-binding proposal to acquire Sumo Logic for $11.00 in cash per share of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock (which proposal is referred to as the \u201cJune proposal\u201d).\nOn June 8, 2022, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of Wilson\nSonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, Sumo Logic\u2019s outside legal advisor (which is referred to as\n\u201cWilson Sonsini\u201d), in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Sumo\nLogic Board their fiduciary duties. Ramin Sayar, Sumo Logic\u2019s president and chief executive officer, reviewed the June\nproposal. The Sumo Logic Board determined that the June proposal was credible and merited further consideration\nand, for convenience and efficiency, delegated authority to its Audit Committee to work with Wilson Sonsini and\nSumo Logic\u2019s other advisors, as well as Sumo Logic management, to further analyze the June proposal.\nFollowing this meeting, the Audit Committee and the Sumo Logic Board each met on multiple occasions to evaluate\nthe June proposal with the assistance of Wilson Sonsini and an investment bank (which, for purposes of clarity, was\nnot Morgan Stanley). At the conclusion of this process, the Sumo Logic Board determined that the June proposal\nwas not at a compelling valuation. The Sumo Logic Board also noted its belief in the strength of Sumo Logic\u2019s\nprospects as an independent public company and expectation that investors would react positively to Sumo Logic\u2019s\n(1) financial results for the remainder of its 2023 fiscal year\u037e and (2) upcoming investor day, during which Sumo Logic\nmanagement would provide additional details on the company\u2019s business and financial plan, path to profitability and\nstrategic vision.\nOn July 12, 2022, Mr. Robel met with representatives of Francisco Partners. The representatives of Francisco Partners\nrequested an introductory meeting with Sumo Logic management. Mr. Robel stated that a meeting with Sumo Logic\nmanagement was not warranted at that time. In addition, Mr. Robel informed Francisco Partners that the June\nproposal was not at a compelling valuation and that the Sumo Logic Board believed in the strength of Sumo Logic\u2019s\nprospects as an independent public company.\nOn August 25, 2022, Sumo Logic announced earnings for the second quarter of its 2023 fiscal year. Sumo Logic\nexceeded the guidance that it had provided to the investment community with respect to Sumo Logic\u2019s total revenue,\nnon-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net loss per share for that quarter.\n34TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 20, 2022, Sumo Logic held its investor day, during which Sumo Logic management explained Sumo\nLogic\u2019s business and financial plan, path to profitability and strategic vision.\nBy early October 2022, Sumo Logic common stock was trading at prices similar to that in June 2022.\nOn October 3, 2022, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of\nWilson Sonsini in attendance. The Sumo Logic Board discussed investors\u2019 feedback to the investor day. In an effort\nto ensure that Sumo Logic was appropriately prepared should any third party (including Francisco Partners) submit\nan acquisition proposal, the Sumo Logic Board determined to explore the possible retention of an investment bank to\nprovide financial advice and perspective. The Sumo Logic Board also instructed Messrs. Robel and Sayar to meet\nwith representatives of Francisco Partners to better understand the current state of Francisco Partners' objectives\nwith respect to Sumo Logic.\nIn the days following the October 3, 2022, meeting of the Sumo Logic Board, Mr. Robel and Randy Gottfried, an\nindependent Sumo Logic director and chair of the Audit Committee, contacted Morgan Stanley and another\ninvestment bank to assess their respective qualifications, independence and availability to assist Sumo Logic.\nFollowing discussions with these two investment banks, Mr. Robel and Mr. Gottfried determined to recommend that\nthe Sumo Logic Board engage Morgan Stanley to provide assistance to Sumo Logic due to Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nknowledge of Sumo Logic from its role as an underwriter in Sumo Logic\u2019s initial public offering, as well as its\nqualifications, knowledge of the industry in which Sumo Logic operates and experience in advising similar companies\nin connection with potential strategic transactions. The other investment bank declined to explore an engagement by\nSumo Logic due to its existing workload and inability to dedicate the appropriate resources to an engagement.\nOn October 10, 2022, Messrs. Robel and Sayar met with representatives of Francisco Partners. During the meeting,\nthe representatives of Francisco Partners expressed their continued interest in acquiring Sumo Logic. Following the\nmeeting, Mr. Robel updated the Sumo Logic Board on the discussion.\nOn October 14, 2022, representatives of a potential financial sponsor acquiror (which we refer to as \u201cSponsor A\u201d)\ncontacted Stewart Grierson, Sumo Logic\u2019s chief financial officer. The representatives of Sponsor A expressed\nSponsor A\u2019s admiration for Sumo Logic and stated that Sponsor A had accumulated a position in Sumo Logic\ncommon stock through open market purchases. The representatives of Sponsor A also expressed Sponsor A\u2019s\ninterest in being included in any strategic review process that was undertaken by the Sumo Logic Board. At no point\nduring the conversation did Sponsor A make a proposal to acquire Sumo Logic. In the light of Sponsor A\u2019s status as\na stockholder of Sumo Logic, the parties agreed to meet following Sumo Logic\u2019s earnings release for the third quarter\nof its 2023 fiscal year\u037e Sumo Logic regularly meets with investors in the ordinary course following earnings\nannouncements. Promptly following the meeting, Mr. Grierson updated members of the Sumo Logic Board on the\ndiscussion.\nOn November 2, 2022, Francisco Partners provided Sumo Logic with a non-binding proposal to acquire Sumo Logic\nfor $11.50 in cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock (which proposal is referred to as the \u201cNovember proposal\u201d).\nShortly thereafter, representatives of Francisco Partners contacted Mr. Robel to request a meeting to discuss the\nNovember proposal.\nOn November 4, 2022, Mr. Robel met with representatives of a potential financial sponsor acquiror (which we refer to\nas \u201cSponsor B\u201d) at Sponsor B\u2019s request. Sponsor B was introduced to Mr. Robel by a Sumo Logic stockholder.\nDuring this meeting, the participants discussed, in general terms, Sponsor B\u2019s business and strategy. A potential\nacquisition of Sumo Logic by Sponsor B was not discussed.\nAlso on November 4, 2022, the Sumo Logic Board met, with representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Sumo Logic Board their fiduciary duties. The\nSumo Logic Board discussed the November proposal and Mr. Robel\u2019s meeting with Sponsor B. The Sumo Logic\nBoard determined that (1) the November proposal was credible and had the potential to lead to a transaction that\nwould be attractive to Sumo Logic and its stockholders\u037e and (2) it might be appropriate to commence, in the near\nfuture, a review of Sumo Logic\u2019s strategic alternatives. In view of the potentially significant workload that could be\ninvolved in a review of strategic alternatives, the possibility that Sumo Logic management might need feedback and\ndirection on relatively short notice, and the benefits, convenience and efficiency of having a subset of directors\noversee any process of considering strategic alternatives, the Sumo Logic Board delegated authority to its Corporate\nGovernance and Nominating Committee (which we refer to as the \u201cCorporate Governance Committee\u201d) to,\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\namong other things, (1) oversee and assist Sumo Logic management and Sumo Logic\u2019s advisors and consultants with\nrespect to the exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives\u037e (2) explore, evaluate, consider, review and\nnegotiate the terms and conditions of any transaction relating to any strategic alternative\u037e and (3) if appropriate,\nrecommend to the Sumo Logic Board what action, if any, should be taken by Sumo Logic with respect to any strategic\nalternative. The delegation of authority to the Corporate Governance Committee was for convenience and efficiency,\nand not to address any potential conflicts of interest. The Sumo Logic Board retained the exclusive power and\nauthority to approve the entry into a definitive agreement relating to any strategic alternative, including a sale of\nSumo Logic. It was also understood that the Sumo Logic Board would continue to have an active role in the\nconsideration of strategic alternatives, and that the Corporate Governance Committee would update and seek input\nfrom the Sumo Logic Board as appropriate. The Sumo Logic Board did not provide for the payment of any additional\ncompensation to the members of the Corporate Governance Committee in consideration of the expanded role of the\ncommittee (other than their ordinary course compensation as members of the Sumo Logic Board and such committee).\nThe Sumo Logic Board also considered Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications and independence and discussed engaging\nMorgan Stanley as Sumo Logic\u2019s financial advisor. Morgan Stanley is well known to the Sumo Logic Board given\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s role as an underwriter in Sumo Logic\u2019s initial public offering, as well as Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nqualifications, extensive expertise, international reputation, knowledge of the industry in which Sumo Logic operates\nand experience in advising similar companies in connection with potential strategic transactions. The Sumo Logic\nBoard approved the engagement of Morgan Stanley as Sumo Logic\u2019s financial advisor and instructed Mr. Gottfried to\nwork with the Corporate Governance Committee to negotiate and enter into an appropriate engagement letter with\nMorgan Stanley. Following this meeting, Mr. Gottfried, together with the Corporate Governance Committee,\nnegotiated the terms of an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley.\nOn November 8, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with representatives of Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. It was the practice of the Corporate Governance Committee, at this and subsequent meetings, to invite\nMr. Gottfried to attend the committee\u2019s meetings in order to have the benefit of his perspective and expertise. The\nCorporate Governance Committee also had a practice of meeting in executive session without Sumo Logic\nmanagement or representatives of Morgan Stanley during its meetings. The Corporate Governance Committee\ndiscussed the November proposal and various responses to this proposal, along with the terms of the engagement\nletter with Morgan Stanley.\nOn November 15, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley\ndescribed the broad contours of a strategic review process that could be undertaken by Sumo Logic. The Corporate\nGovernance Committee discussed the potential scope of such a strategic review process, including a preliminary list\nof counterparties that might have an interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic, and the ability to finance and\nconsummate an acquisition. Also considered were potential risks of a strategic review process, including potential\npublic disclosures, management and employee disruption and distraction, and impacts on Sumo Logic\u2019s business,\nand the increase in the likelihood of those risks if a wider private or public process was used relative to a process that\nwas more targeted. In consideration of these risks, it was the consensus of the Corporate Governance Committee that\nSumo Logic should pursue a targeted, private process focused on the potential strategic and financial acquirers most\nlikely to have an interest in acquiring Sumo Logic and the capability to finance and consummate such an acquisition.\nThe Corporate Governance Committee agreed that, as a first step in that process, representatives of Sumo Logic\nshould meet with representatives of Francisco Partners to discuss the November proposal. In the days after this\nmeeting, the Corporate Governance Committee reviewed and approved the final terms of an engagement letter with\nMorgan Stanley.\nOn November 16, 2022, Messrs. Gottfried, Grierson, Robel and Sayar met, at the direction of the Corporate\nGovernance Committee, with representatives of Francisco Partners to discuss the November proposal.\nOn November 21, 2022, Sumo Logic entered into an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley.\nOn November 22, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The Corporate Governance Committee\ndiscussed the November proposal and the contours of a strategic review process that could be undertaken by Sumo\nLogic, including a preliminary list of counterparties that might have an interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo\nLogic.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 29, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. Discussion continued regarding the\ncontours of a strategic review process that could be undertaken by Sumo Logic, including a preliminary list of\ncounterparties that might have an interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic. The representatives of Morgan\nStanley reviewed with the Corporate Governance Committee the terms of the November proposal from a financial\npoint of view.\nOn December 1, 2022, representatives of a potential financial sponsor acquiror (which we refer to as \u201cSponsor C\u201d), on\nan unsolicited basis, contacted Morgan Stanley and stated that Sponsor C would potentially be interested in\npursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic. Sponsor C did not make a proposal to acquire Sumo Logic. The\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley reported this outreach by Sponsor C to the Corporate Governance Committee.\nOn December 7, 2022, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of\neach of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley provided their\nperspective on market conditions and mergers and acquisitions activity in the software and broader technology\nspace. They also described the broad contours of a strategic review process that could be undertaken by Sumo\nLogic, including a preliminary list of counterparties that might have an interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo\nLogic. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the Corporate Governance Committee\u2019s determination to\npursue a targeted, private strategic review process. As part of this discussion, the Sumo Logic Board noted the\npotential negative impacts on Sumo Logic of such a process, including the impact on customers and employees of\nany rumors that Sumo Logic was pursuing a sale. The Sumo Logic Board discussed potential alternatives to a sale of\nSumo Logic, including continuing as an independent public company. It was the consensus of the Sumo Logic Board\nthat Morgan Stanley should commence a process to contact 14 potential acquirers, composed of four potential\nstrategic acquirors and ten potential financial sponsor acquirors (including Francisco Partners) to better understand\ntheir respective interest in acquiring Sumo Logic. The 14 potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors were\nselected by the Sumo Logic Board following discussions with Morgan Stanley and Sumo Logic management and\ntaking into account the expected relative interest of each potential acquiror in an acquisition of Sumo Logic and each\npotential acquiror\u2019s ability to finance and consummate an acquisition. The Sumo Logic Board concluded that Morgan\nStanley should inform Francisco Partners that the November proposal was not compelling but Francisco Partners was\nwelcome to participate in the strategic review process. The Sumo Logic Board discussed the conversations held to\ndate with Sponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C and determined not to include Sponsor A, Sponsor B or Sponsor C\nin the initial phase of the strategic review process out of a belief that they were unlikely to have the capability to\nfinance and consummate an acquisition of Sumo Logic.\nIn the days following the December 7, 2022, meeting of the Sumo Logic Board, Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the\nSumo Logic Board, (1) informed Francisco Partners that the November proposal was not compelling and invited\nFrancisco Partners to conduct additional due diligence to increase its proposal and (2) contacted the other 13\npotential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors selected by the Sumo Logic Board to gauge their interest in an\nacquisition of Sumo Logic. Nine of the potential financial sponsor acquirors (including Francisco Partners) and two\npotential strategic acquirors (which we refer to as \u201cStrategic 1\u201d and \u201cStrategic 2\u201d), ultimately entered into\nconfidentiality agreements with Sumo Logic. Certain of these confidentiality agreements included a customary\n\u201cstandstill\u201d restriction on the counterparty\u2019s ability to make public proposals to acquire Sumo Logic, but (1) all such\nstandstill restrictions terminated upon the announcement of the signing of the merger agreement\u037e and (2) none of the\nconfidentiality agreements included restrictions on any counterparty\u2019s ability to make private proposals to acquire\nSumo Logic.\nOn December 5, 2022, Sumo Logic announced earnings for the third quarter of its 2023 fiscal year.\nOn December 9, 2022, Sumo Logic management met with representatives of Sponsor A, as agreed in the parties\u2019\nOctober 2022 meeting. During the meeting, the representatives of Sponsor A spoke generally about the possible\nbenefits to Sumo Logic of not being a public company and Sponsor A\u2019s willingness to partner with Sumo Logic if it\nchose to become a private company. Sponsor A did not make an offer to acquire Sumo Logic during this meeting.\nOn December 13, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley\nprovided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrelative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The members of Sumo Logic management\ndescribed their (1) recent meeting with representatives of Sponsor A\u037e and (2) current expectations for Sumo Logic\u2019s\noperating and financial results for fiscal years 2024 through 2026.\nFrom December 14, 2022 through January 5, 2023, Sumo Logic management, with representatives of Morgan Stanley\nin attendance, gave management presentations concerning Sumo Logic\u2019s business to the nine financial sponsor\nacquirors (including Francisco Partners) that had entered into confidentially agreements with Sumo Logic. After\nundertaking due diligence following these meetings, two of the nine financial sponsor acquirors declined to proceed\nwith further discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Sumo Logic due to other investment priorities and\ngeneralized concerns regarding Sumo Logic\u2019s business. During this period, Francisco Partners and the six other\nfinancial sponsor acquirors considering an acquisition of Sumo Logic (which we refer to as \u201cSponsor D,\u201d \u201cSponsor\nE,\u201d \u201cSponsor F,\u201d \u201cSponsor G,\u201d \u201cSponsor H\u201d and \u201cSponsor I,\u201d respectively) were granted access to an electronic\ndataroom containing financial and business information with respect to Sumo Logic to support their due diligence\nreview of Sumo Logic. Each of Strategic 1 and Strategic 2 had the opportunity to participate in management\npresentations during this period, but, given the other priorities of Strategic 1 and Strategic 2, neither received a\nmanagement presentation until the week of January 16, 2023.\nOn December 20, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley\nprovided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the\nrelative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The Corporate Governance Committee approved a\nrequest from Sponsor G to partner with another financial sponsor acquiror concerning a possible joint bid to acquire\nSumo Logic. The Corporate Governance Committee discussed whether to include Sponsor A, Sponsor B or Sponsor\nC in the current phase of Sumo Logic\u2019s strategic review process. It was the consensus of the Corporate Governance\nCommittee (1) to pursue discussions with Sponsor A given Sponsor A\u2019s stated interest in participating in a strategic\nreview process that Sumo Logic might choose to undertake\u037e (2) not to pursue discussions with Sponsor B given that\n(a) Sponsor B had not expressed an interest in acquiring Sumo Logic\u037e and (b) Sponsor B was unlikely to be able to\nfinance and consummate an acquisition of Sumo Logic\u037e and (3) not to pursue discussions with Sponsor C given that\nSponsor C was unlikely to be able to finance and consummate an acquisition of Sumo Logic. The Corporate\nGovernance Committee discussed the possibility of contacting additional potential strategic or financial sponsor\nacquirors beyond Sponsor A, Sponsor B, Sponsor C and the 14 other potential strategic and financial sponsor\nacquirors (including Francisco Partners) that had already been contacted. It was the consensus of the Corporate\nGovernance Committee not to contact additional potential acquirors at that time given the robust interest in an\nacquisition already being displayed and the desire for a targeted, private strategic review process that minimized the\npotential for rumors that Sumo Logic was conducting a review of strategic alternatives, which would be disruptive to\nSumo Logic\u2019s business.\nOn December 21, 2022, a representative of Sponsor A contacted Mr. Sayar to request a meeting with Sumo Logic\nmanagement. Later that day, and consistent with the decision of the Corporate Governance Committee,\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley contacted Sponsor A to invite Sponsor A to participate in the strategic review\nprocess. Sponsor A responded that it would need additional time to consider whether to participate.\nOn December 27, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The members of Sumo Logic\nmanagement reviewed with the Corporate Governance Committee a draft, prepared by Sumo Logic management, of\nSumo Logic\u2019s preliminary long-range operating plan. The members of Sumo Logic management described the process\nfor preparing the long-range operating plan, along with the underlying assumptions and various execution and other\nrisks to realizing the forecasted results. The Corporate Governance Committee provided advice and input to Sumo\nLogic management on the preliminary long-range operating plan. It was the consensus of the Corporate Governance\nCommittee that the preliminary long-range operating plan was not yet developed sufficiently to recommend to the\nSumo Logic Board, and, accordingly, the Corporate Governance Committee directed Sumo Logic management to\nrefine the plan based on the input provided by the Corporate Governance Committee.\nOn January 3, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The members of Sumo Logic management reviewed with the\nCorporate Governance Committee a revised draft of Sumo Logic\u2019s preliminary long-range operating plan, which\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreflected the input received from the Corporate Governance Committee at its meeting on December 27, 2022. It was the\nconsensus of the Corporate Governance Committee to share the revised preliminary long-range operating plan with\nthe Sumo Logic Board for additional input and perspectives.\nOn January 6, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of\nWilson Sonsini in attendance. The members of Sumo Logic management reviewed with the Sumo Logic Board a draft\nof Sumo Logic\u2019s preliminary long-range operating plan. The process for preparing the preliminary long-range\noperating plan was described, along with the underlying assumptions and various execution and other risks to\nrealizing the forecasted results. The Sumo Logic Board provided advice and input to Sumo Logic management on the\npreliminary long-range operating plan and directed Sumo Logic management to refine the preliminary long-range\noperating plan based on the input provided by the Sumo Logic Board.\nOn January 10, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley\nprovided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the\nrelative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The Corporate Governance Committee noted the\nsignificant demands on Sumo Logic management and associated distraction as a result of the strategic review\nprocess. The Corporate Governance Committee approved the distribution by Morgan Stanley of a bid process letter\nto those potential acquirors that were still considering an acquisition of Sumo Logic, which letter would request\nwritten acquisition proposals be submitted by January 24, 2023.\nOn January 13, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of\neach of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The members of Sumo Logic management reviewed a\nrevised draft of Sumo Logic\u2019s long-range operating plan, which reflected the input received from the Sumo Logic\nBoard at its meeting on January 6, 2023 (which long-range operating plan is referred to as the \u201cJanuary 2023 long-\nrange plan\u201d). Additional information about the January 2023 long-range plan is contained in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201c-Projections.\u201d The Sumo Logic Board approved providing the January 2023 long-range plan to\n(1) Morgan Stanley for purposes of its financial analyses of Sumo Logic\u037e and (2) potential acquirors. A subset of the\nJanuary 2023 long-range plan were subsequently provided to each of Francisco Partners, Sponsor D, Sponsor E,\nSponsor F, Sponsor G and its partner (together, the \u201cSponsor G Consortium\u201d), Sponsor H and Sponsor I.\nOn January 16, 2023, representatives of a potential financing source (which we refer to as \u201cFinancial A\u201d) contacted\nMorgan Stanley concerning Financial A\u2019s interest in making a minority investment in Sumo Logic. The\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley responded that they would inform the Sumo Logic Board of the conversation.\nOn January 17, 2023, consistent with the direction of the Corporate Governance Committee, Morgan Stanley\ndistributed bid process letters to Francisco Partners, Sponsor D, Sponsor E, the Sponsor G Consortium, Sponsor H\nand Sponsor I\u037e these were the potential acquirors that were still actively considering an acquisition. The bid process\nletters requested written acquisition proposals no later than January 24, 2023. Following distribution of the bid\nprocess letters and until January 24, 2023, representatives of Morgan Stanley had multiple discussions with such\nparties to encourage them to submit an acquisition proposal.\nOn January 17, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley\nprovided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the\nrelative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The representatives of Morgan Stanley described\ntheir conversation with Financial A. It was the consensus of the Corporate Governance Committee that, given the\nstrategic efforts then underway, the time was not right to pursue discussions with Financial A.\nLater on January 17, 2023, Sumo Logic management, with representatives of Morgan Stanley in attendance, gave a\nmanagement presentation concerning Sumo Logic\u2019s business to Strategic 2.\nStill later on January 17, 2023, representatives of Sponsor A contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nexpressed Sponsor A\u2019s interest in acquiring Sumo Logic. Sponsor A noted that it could only provide up to $300\nmillion of committed equity financing and would require additional co-investors to finance and consummate an\nacquisition of Sumo Logic.\nOn January 18, 2023, representatives of a potential strategic acquiror (which we refer to as \u201cStrategic 3\u201d), on an\nunsolicited basis, contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley concerning Strategic 3\u2019s interest in pursuing an\nacquisition of Sumo Logic. The representatives of Morgan Stanley responded that they would inform the Sumo Logic\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard of the conversation. On the same day, representatives of Morgan Stanley, with the authority of the Corporate\nGovernance Committee, spoke with representatives of Sponsor B regarding Sponsor B\u2019s interest in pursuing an\nacquisition of Sumo Logic and to better understand Sponsor B\u2019s ability to finance and consummate a transaction.\nLater on January 18, 2023, Sponsor F informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Sponsor F was no longer\npursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic given other investment priorities and certain concerns regarding Sumo\nLogic\u2019s business.\nStill later on January 18, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley\nprovided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the\nrelative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The representatives of Morgan Stanley also\ndescribed their conversation with Strategic 3. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Sumo Logic\nBoard preliminary financial analyses of Sumo Logic based on the January 2023 long-range plan.\nOn January 20, 2023, Sumo Logic management, with representatives of Morgan Stanley in attendance, gave a\nmanagement presentation concerning Sumo Logic\u2019s business to Strategic 1.\nOn January 23, 2023, The Information published an article stating that private equity firms, including Francisco\nPartners, had approached Sumo Logic regarding a possible acquisition. The price per share of Sumo Logic common\nstock as of the close of trading on January 20, 2023, the last trading day prior to such speculation, was $7.67.\nOn January 23, 2023, each of Sponsor E and Sponsor I independently informed representatives of Morgan Stanley\nthat Sponsor E and Sponsor I, respectively, were no longer pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic. Among the\nreasons cited by these potential acquirors for choosing not to submit an acquisition proposal were concerns\nregarding competition facing Sumo Logic\u2019s business, their assessment of Sumo Logic\u2019s potential cross-sell\nopportunity between their respective portfolio companies, cost structure concerns, and additional work necessary to\nunderstand Sumo Logic\u2019s go-to-market strategy. In addition, the Sponsor G Consortium and Sponsor H, separately\nand independently, each informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that it did not intend to submit a formal\nproposal to acquire Sumo Logic but remained interested in pursuing an acquisition at a price of approximately $10.00\nin cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock.\nOn January 24, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini\ndiscussed with the members of the Corporate Governance Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the feedback from those parties that had declined to submit an acquisition proposal. The\nCorporate Governance Committee discussed (1) the timing for the receipt of acquisition proposals from Francisco\nPartners and Sponsor D, which were expected within the next day\u037e and (2) the additional due diligence required by\neach of Strategic 1 and Strategic 2 for either party to submit an acquisition proposal. It was noted that Strategic 1 was\nseeking highly confidential and competitively sensitive due diligence information regarding Sumo Logic. The\nCorporate Governance Committee discussed the status of Sponsor A and the possibility of contacting Strategic 3\nregarding its interest in considering an acquisition of Sumo Logic but did not make any decisions in this regard.\nLater on January 24, 2023, representatives of two potential financial sponsor acquirors (which we refer to as \u201cSponsor\nJ\u201d and \u201cSponsor K\u201d) independently contacted Mr. Sayar regarding their interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo\nLogic. Mr. Sayar responded that he would inform the Sumo Logic Board of the conversation.\nStill later on January 24, 2023, Francisco Partners submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire Sumo Logic for $11.95\nin cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock (which is referred to as the \u201cJanuary proposal\u201d). The January\nproposal (1) contemplated that investment funds managed by Francisco Partners would be responsible for the entire\npurchase price in the acquisition\u037e and (2) expressed a willingness to sign and announce a transaction within a week.\nOn January 25, 2023, Strategic 2 informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that it was no longer pursuing an\nacquisition of Sumo Logic given other investment priorities and concerns regarding Sumo Logic\u2019s business.\nAlso on January 25, 2023, representatives of a potential financial sponsor acquiror (which we refer to as \u201cSponsor L\u201d)\ncontacted representatives of Morgan Stanley regarding Sponsor L\u2019s interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo\nLogic. The representatives of Morgan Stanley responded that they would inform the Sumo Logic Board of the\nconversation.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on January 25, 2023, Sponsor D submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire Sumo Logic for $10.50 in cash per\nshare of Sumo Logic common stock (which proposal is referred to as the \u201cSponsor D proposal\u201d). The Sponsor D\nproposal contemplated that (1) the definitive agreement would not be subject to any financing contingency\u037e and (2)\nthe parties sign and announce a transaction in early March 2023.\nOn January 26, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini\ndiscussed with the members of the Corporate Governance Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of\nMorgan Stanley provided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor\nacquirors and the relative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. It was noted that Strategic 1\ncontinued to seek highly confidential and competitively sensitive due diligence information. The representatives of\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the terms of the January proposal and the Sponsor D proposal from a financial point of\nview. The Corporate Governance Committee discussed the current status of the strategic review process. The\nCorporate Governance Committee also discussed Sumo Logic\u2019s prospects as an independent public company. The\nCorporate Governance Committee determined to recommend to the Sumo Logic Board that (1) Morgan Stanley\nrequest that each of Francisco Partners and Sponsor D submit revised proposals to acquire Sumo Logic no later than\nFebruary 3, 2023\u037e (2) Morgan Stanley inform Francisco Partners that the Sumo Logic Board was seeking a purchase\nprice per share in the teens, or as close to that as possible\u037e and (3) Sumo Logic provide Strategic 1 with a targeted\nsubset of its requested due diligence information in the hopes of positioning Strategic 1 to make an acquisition\nproposal. Discussion ensued as to whether to pursue discussions with any of the parties that had made unsolicited\nrequests to engage in acquisition discussions with Sumo Logic. It was the consensus of the Corporate Governance\nCommittee that, given their respective abilities to consummate a transaction as well as the advanced nature of the\nstrategic review process, Morgan Stanley should contact each of Sponsor J, Sponsor K, Sponsor L and Strategic 3 to\nbetter understand each party\u2019s interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic on an accelerated timeline. The\nCorporate Governance Committee determined not to engage further with Sponsor A, Sponsor B or Sponsor C at that\ntime given the number of other potential acquirors already in the process, the robustness of the interest displayed by\nthose potential acquirors, and the belief of the Corporate Governance Committee that none of Sponsor A, Sponsor B\nor Sponsor C was likely to have the capability to finance and consummate an acquisition of Sumo Logic.\nLater on January 26, 2023, representatives of a potential strategic acquiror (which we refer to as \u201cStrategic 4\u201d)\ncontacted representatives of Morgan Stanley concerning Strategic 4\u2019s interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo\nLogic. The representatives of Morgan Stanley responded that they would inform the Sumo Logic Board of the\nconversation.\nOn January 27, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of\neach of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an\nupdate on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the relative level of\nacquisition interest that each was then displaying. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of the\nJanuary proposal and the Sponsor D proposal from a financial point of view. The members of the Corporate\nGovernance Committee provided their recommendation on next steps to the Sumo Logic Board. The Sumo Logic\nBoard reviewed the results of the strategic review process, and, in the light of that process nearing a conclusion,\ndiscussed whether outreach to additional potential strategic or financial sponsor acquirors was warranted. After\ndiscussion, the Sumo Logic Board agreed with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Committee.\nHowever, after considering the remaining parties still engaged in discussions with Sumo Logic, the Sumo Logic Board\nauthorized Morgan Stanley to contact (1) each of Sponsor A and Strategic 4 regarding their interest in pursuing an\nacquisition of Sumo Logic on an accelerated basis\u037e and (2) two additional potential strategic acquirors (which are\nreferred to as \u201cStrategic 5\u201d and \u201cStrategic 6\u201d) regarding their interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic.\nStrategic 5 and Strategic 6 had been identified by Morgan Stanley as parties that may be interested in pursuing an\nacquisition but had not been contacted given a perceived lower level of acquisition interest and concerns about\nrevealing Sumo Logic\u2019s confidential information to competitors.\nIn the days following the January 27, 2023, meeting of the Sumo Logic Board, Sumo Logic management or\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley had the conversations authorized by the Sumo Logic Board. In response, (1)\nSponsor J, Sponsor L, Strategic 3 and Strategic 5 declined to pursue discussions regarding an acquisition of Sumo\nLogic\u037e (2) Sponsor K and Strategic 4 expressed preliminary interest in pursuing acquisition discussions\u037e (3) Sponsor\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA continued to express preliminary interest in pursuing acquisition discussions and expressed a theoretical ability to\npotentially offer a price of approximately $13.00 in cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock\u037e and (4) Strategic 6\nstated that it was unlikely that it would pursue an acquisition but required additional time to consider the opportunity\nbefore confirming.\nOn January 31, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini\ndiscussed with the members of the Corporate Governance Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of\nMorgan Stanley provided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor\nacquirors and the relative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. It was noted that after receiving\na subset of its requested due diligence information, Strategic 1 continued to request highly confidential diligence\ninformation as a condition to submitting an acquisition proposal. It was the consensus of the Corporate Governance\nCommittee that Strategic 1 should be informed that it should provide a targeted list of the minimum due diligence\ninformation that it required to make a preliminary acquisition proposal, and that Sumo Logic would evaluate that list.\nMorgan Stanley was instructed to inform Strategic 1 of this decision. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed\nthe key terms of a proposed merger agreement that would be provided to potential acquirors. The Corporate\nGovernance Committee authorized providing the draft merger agreement to Francisco Partners and Sponsor D, with\ninstructions that such parties return a revised draft of the merger agreement with their acquisition proposals on or\nprior to February 3, 2023. In view of the interest expressed by Sponsor A, the Corporate Governance Committee also\nauthorized providing Sponsor A with the draft merger agreement, but only if Sponsor A expressed an ability to\npursue an acquisition of Sumo Logic on an accelerated basis.\nLater on January 31, 2023, Strategic 1 provided a list of the minimum due diligence information that it required to make\na preliminary acquisition proposal, which list continued to request a significant amount of Sumo Logic\u2019s highly\nconfidential and competitively sensitive information.\nLater on January 31, 2023, Morgan Stanley distributed the draft merger agreement to Francisco Partners and Sponsor\nD.\nStill later on January 31, 2023, Sponsor A entered into a confidentiality agreement with Sumo Logic, which included a\ncustomary \u201cstandstill\u201d restriction on Sponsor A\u2019s ability to make public proposals to acquire Sumo Logic. However,\n(1) all such restrictions terminated upon the announcement of the signing of the merger agreement\u037e and (2) there were\nno restrictions on Sponsor A\u2019s ability to make private proposals to acquire Sumo Logic. Sponsor A was subsequently\ngranted access to the dataroom containing financial and business information with respect to Sumo Logic, and\ninformed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Sponsor A required 30 to 45 days to complete its due diligence.\nOn February 2, 2023, representatives of each of Francisco Partners and Sponsor D met separately with members of\nSumo Logic management and representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss Sumo Logic\u2019s anticipated business and\nfinancial results for the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year.\nAlso on February 2, 2023, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Strategic 1. Consistent with\nCorporate Governance Committee\u2019s instruction, the representatives of Morgan Stanley explained Sumo Logic\u2019s\nconcerns with sharing Sumo Logic\u2019s highly confidential and competitively sensitive information without first\nreceiving a tangible indication from Strategic 1 that it was serious about acquiring Sumo Logic.\nOn February 3, 2023, Sponsor D informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that it was withdrawing its acquisition\nproposal and no longer pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic. Among the reasons cited was uncertainty\nsurrounding investor reaction to Sumo Logic\u2019s results for the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year and the effect of\nsuch results on Sumo Logic\u2019s expected financial guidance for the first quarter and full 2024 fiscal year.\nAlso on February 3, 2023, Francisco Partners provided Sumo Logic with a non-binding proposal to acquire Sumo\nLogic for $12.00 in cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock (which proposal is referred to as the\n\u201cFebruary proposal\u201d). With the February proposal, Francisco Partners provided a revised draft of the merger\nagreement and a draft of the equity commitment letter. The February proposal noted that Francisco Partners was\nprepared to sign a definitive merger agreement and announce an acquisition of Sumo Logic within 48 hours.\nOn February 5, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley\nreviewed the terms of the February proposal from a financial point of view. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini\nreviewed the key terms of the revised merger agreement from Francisco Partners. The Corporate Governance\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCommittee discussed the advanced nature of acquisition discussions with Francisco Partners in relation to (1)\nSponsor D and its decision to withdraw its acquisition proposal\u037e (2) Strategic 1\u2019s continued insistence on receiving\nhighly confidential due diligence information as a condition to making a preliminary acquisition proposal\u037e (3)\nStrategic 4 and Sponsor K, each of which had stated an intent to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Sumo\nLogic but had not done so at that time\u037e (4) Sponsor A, which had stated that it required 30 to 45 days to complete due\ndiligence and had not provided any assurances concerning its ability to consummate an acquisition of Sumo Logic\u037e\nand (5) Strategic 6, whose status remained uncertain. Given (1) the significant time that would likely be required for\nany of Strategic 1, Strategic 4, Strategic 6, Sponsor A or Sponsor K to submit an acquisition proposal (if they\nsubmitted a proposal at all) and the potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Francisco Partners if Sumo\nLogic sought to continue to pursue discussions with these other third parties\u037e (2) Sponsor D\u2019s decision to cease\nacquisition discussions following its review of Sumo Logic\u2019s earnings results (which results had not yet been\nprovided to any of Strategic 1, Strategic 4, Strategic 6, Sponsor A or Sponsor K)\u037e and (3) the ability of any interested\nparty to pursue an acquisition of Sumo Logic after entry into the merger agreement (so long as such acquisition met\ncertain objective standards), it was the consensus of the Corporate Governance Committee that pursuing the\nFebruary proposal was in the best interests of Sumo Logic and the Sumo Logic stockholders. The Corporate\nGovernance Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to inform Francisco Partners that the Sumo Logic Board was likely\nto be supportive of the February proposal but expected the acquisition price to (1) represent a premium to Sumo\nLogic\u2019s closing stock price on the trading day prior to announcement of a transaction\u037e and (2) be no less than $12.00\nin cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock. The Corporate Governance Committee also instructed Wilson\nSonsini to negotiate the remaining terms of the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter with the goal of\nsigning the merger agreement as soon as possible. Following the meeting, Morgan Stanley informed Francisco\nPartners of the decisions of the Corporate Governance Committee.\nFrom February 5, 2023, until February 9, 2023, members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of Wilson\nSonsini, and representatives of each of Francisco Partners and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, legal counsel to Francisco\nPartners (which we refer to as \u201cKirkland & Ellis\u201d), met regularly to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement and\nthe equity commitment letter. The principal areas of negotiation in the merger agreement included (1) the\ncircumstances in which the Sumo Logic Board could change its recommendation to its stockholders or negotiate or\naccept an alternative acquisition transaction\u037e (2) the definition of \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d\u037e (3) the conditions to each\nparty\u2019s obligation to consummate the merger\u037e (4) the nature of each party\u2019s right to terminate the merger agreement\u037e\n(5) the nature and scope of the interim operating covenants applicable to Sumo Logic during the period prior to the\nclosing of the merger\u037e (6) the size of the termination fee payable by Sumo Logic in certain circumstances\u037e and (7) the\ncap on any damages available to Sumo Logic in the event that Sumo Logic terminated the merger agreement because\nof Parent and Merger Sub\u2019s failure to consummate the merger on the terms set forth in the merger agreement. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland & Ellis also negotiated the terms of the voting agreements.\nOn February 6, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of\neach of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the\nmembers of the Sumo Logic Board their fiduciary duties. The decisions of the Corporate Governance Committee were\nreviewed, along with the terms of the February proposal (including the terms of the revised merger agreement and\nequity commitment letter provided by Francisco Partners). The Sumo Logic Board reviewed Morgan Stanley\u2019s\ncustomary relationship disclosures, which included disclosures with respect to Francisco Partners as well as Sumo\nLogic (including the fact that in the past two-and-a-half years, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates had received\naggregate fees of approximately $5 to $10 million for financing services provided to Sumo Logic). The Sumo Logic\nBoard determined that no potential or actual conflicts would affect the ability of Morgan Stanley to fulfill its\nresponsibilities as financial advisor to Sumo Logic.\nOn February 8, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The open points in the merger\nagreement were discussed.\nLater on February 8, 2023, The Wall Street Journal published an article stating that Sumo Logic was nearing a deal to\nbe acquired by Francisco Partners at a price of $12.00 to $13.00 per share.\nStill later on February 8, 2023, and following the close of trading on Nasdaq, representatives of Morgan Stanley met\nwith representatives of Francisco Partners. The representatives of Francisco Partners informed Morgan Stanley that\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFrancisco Partners would not pay a premium to the closing price of Sumo Logic common stock on February 8, 2023\n(which price was $12.18 per share). However, Francisco Partners did increase the value of its proposal to $12.05 in\ncash per share of Sumo Logic common stock (which proposal is referred to as the \u201cfinal proposal\u201d).\nStill later on February 8, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini\ndiscussed with the members of the Sumo Logic Board their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Morgan Stanley\nreviewed the terms of the final proposal from a financial point of view. The representatives of Morgan Stanley\nconfirmed that there were no changes to the customary relationship disclosures with Francisco Partners previously\nprovided to the Sumo Logic Board. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed the key terms of the merger\nagreement and the equity commitment letter. It was the consensus of the Sumo Logic Board to accept the final\nproposal. The Sumo Logic Board instructed the representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley to\nposition Sumo Logic to be able to sign the merger agreement prior to the start of trading on Nasdaq on February 9,\n2023.\nFollowing the meeting of the Sumo Logic Board on February 8, 2023, members of Sumo Logic management and\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini, and representatives of each of Francisco Partners and Kirkland & Ellis, finalized\nthe negotiations of the merger agreement, the equity commitment letter and the voting agreements.\nEarly on February 9, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives\nof each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with\nthe members of the Sumo Logic Board their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s financial analyses of the final proposal. Morgan Stanley then rendered its oral opinion,\nsubsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of February 9, 2023, and based upon and subject to the assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken\nby Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the per share consideration of $12.05 in cash to be received by\nthe holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the\nmerger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock, as\nmore fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\u201d and\nthe full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The Sumo Logic Board considered that the\nper share price constitutes a premium of approximately 57 percent to Sumo Logic\u2019s unaffected closing stock price on\nJanuary 20, 2023, the last full trading day prior to media reports regarding a possible acquisition of Sumo Logic. The\nSumo Logic Board, after considering the factors more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201c-Recommendation of the Sumo Logic Board and Reasons for the Merger,\u201d (1) determined that the merger agreement,\nthe merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were fair to, advisable and in the best\ninterests of Sumo Logic and its stockholders\u037e and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Sumo Logic, Parent and Merger Sub subsequently\nsigned the merger agreement.\nEarly on February 9, 2023, before the opening of trading on Nasdaq, Sumo Logic and Francisco Partners publicly\ndisclosed the signing of the merger agreement.\nFollowing the signing of the merger agreement, it was discovered that for fiscal years 2024 through 2027 the\ncalculation of EBIT in the Projections included depreciation expense but inadvertently excluded the expense for the\namortization of intangible assets. As a result, adding both depreciation and amortization of intangible assets to EBIT\nwhen calculating EBITDA in the Projections for the same period resulted in an additional add-back of amortization of\nintangible assets and an overstatement of the calculated EBITDA. On March 24, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met,\nwith members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in\nattendance. At the meeting, Sumo Logic\u2019s management summarized the corrections required to the Projections to\nadjust for the additional add-back of amortization of intangible assets in the Projections. The representatives of\nMorgan Stanley noted that, of the financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion to the\nSumo Logic Board on February 9, 2023, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of\nMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC,\u201d only its discounted cash flow analysis was impacted by this matter. The Morgan\nStanley representatives then reviewed with the Sumo Logic Board the results of its discounted cash flow analysis\nbased on the corrected Projections, including that the range of estimated implied value per share of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock, as described more fully in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of Morgan Stanley\n& Co. LLC,\u201d would have been $8.60 - $12.45, rather than the stated $8.86 - $12.72. Following such review, the\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley confirmed to the Sumo Logic Board that the corrected Projections would not\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nhave changed the conclusion set forth in its opinion as of the date it was delivered as of February 9, 2023. The Sumo\nLogic Board considered the matter and determined that the adjustments to the Projections to correct for the\nadditional add-back of amortization of intangible assets would not have changed the Sumo Logic Board\u2019s decision to\napprove the merger agreement or its recommendation to the Sumo Logic stockholders to adopt the merger agreement.\nRecommendation of the Sumo Logic Board and Reasons for the Merger",

In recommending that Sumo Logic\nstockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger, the Sumo Logic Board\nconsidered and analyzed a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in\norder of relative importance). Based on these consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed\nbelow, the Sumo Logic Board concluded that entering into the merger agreement was advisable, fair to and in the best\ninterests of Sumo Logic and Sumo Logic\u2019s stockholders.\nThe Sumo Logic Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination and\nrecommendation:\n\u2022\nBusiness, Financial Condition, Prospects and Execution Risks. The Sumo Logic Board considered the current\nand historical financial condition, results of operations, business and competitive positioning of Sumo Logic, as\nwell as Sumo Logic\u2019s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company. In particular, the Sumo\nLogic Board considered Sumo Logic management\u2019s then-current business plan, including the Projections.\nAdditional information about the preparation and substance of the Projections is contained in the section of this\nproxy statement captioned \u201cProjections.\u201d The Sumo Logic Board considered this plan and the potential\nopportunities that it presented against, among other things, various execution and other risks to achieving\nmanagement\u2019s business plan, including (1) the likelihood that Sumo Logic management\u2019s business plan could be\nachieved in the face of operational and execution risks in the short and long term\u037e (2) the impact of market,\ncustomer and competitive trends on Sumo Logic\u037e and (3) market volatility and the general risks related to market\nconditions that could reduce the price of Sumo Logic common stock. Among the potential risks identified by the\nSumo Logic Board were:\n\u25cb\nSumo Logic\u2019s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included among these\nrisks were consideration of (1) Sumo Logic\u2019s size, as well as its financial resources, relative to those of its\ncompetitors\u037e (2) new and evolving competitive threats\u037e (3) challenges to acquiring new customers or\nretaining Sumo Logic\u2019s existing customers, including challenges to increasing the productivity and\ncapacity of Sumo Logic\u2019s sales force\u037e and (4) other factors affecting the revenues, operating costs and\nprofitability of companies in Sumo Logic\u2019s industry generally and other risk factors described in Sumo\nLogic\u2019s other filings with the SEC, as listed in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You\nCan Find More Information.\u201d\n45TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u25cb\nRecent market volatility and the current and prospective business environment in which Sumo Logic\noperates, including evolving macroeconomic headwinds facing Sumo Logic and its industry more generally\nand the impact of changed economic circumstances on key customer segments, and the likely effect of\nthese factors on Sumo Logic and the execution of Sumo Logic's plans as an independent public company. \n\u25cb\nSumo Logic\u2019s history of losses, and the challenges to achieving profitability in the near term, along with\nevolving investor expectations regarding profitability at technology companies.\n\u25cb\nSumo Logic\u2019s financial results for the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year, which were below the company\u2019s\ninternal forecast and analyst\u2019s estimates of Sumo Logic\u2019s financial performance on new annual recurring\nrevenue for that period.\n\u25cb\nThe challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly traded\ncompany, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance. The Sumo Logic Board was\naware that the price of Sumo Logic common stock could be negatively impacted if Sumo Logic failed to\nmeet investor expectations, including if Sumo Logic failed to meet its growth or profitability objectives.\n\u25cb\nThe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock.\n\u2022\nResults of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of a comprehensive strategic review process\noverseen by the Corporate Governance Committee. The Sumo Logic Board considered that, at Sumo Logic\u2019s\ndirection, representatives of Morgan Stanley, together with representatives of Sumo Logic management and the\nSumo Logic Board, contacted 8 potential strategic acquirors and 15 financial sponsors (including Francisco\nPartners) concerning their interest in an acquisition of Sumo Logic. The Sumo Logic Board considered the\nnature of the engagement by each of these potential acquirors, and that, of these potential acquirors, only\nFrancisco Partners made a proposal for an acquisition of Sumo Logic that was capable of being accepted. The\nBoard was also aware of the public speculation since January 23, 2023, that Sumo Logic was pursuing a sale and\nnoted that, following such speculation, none of the potential acquirors that contacted Sumo Logic about\npursuing an acquisition made a proposal to acquire Sumo Logic. The Sumo Logic Board also considered the\npotential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Francisco Partners in the event it sought to continue to\npursue discussions with other third parties and the potential negative effect that a further extended process\nmight have on Sumo Logic\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nCash Consideration and Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by Sumo Logic stockholders in\nthe merger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business\nand financial execution risks of management\u2019s business plan. The receipt of cash consideration eliminates\nuncertainty and risk for Sumo Logic stockholders related to the continued execution of Sumo Logic\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nBest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Sumo Logic Board that the per share price represents the\nbest value reasonably obtainable for the shares of Sumo Logic common stock, taking into account the Sumo\nLogic Board\u2019s familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business strategy, assets, liabilities and\ngeneral financial condition of Sumo Logic on a historical and prospective basis. In addition, the Sumo Logic\nBoard believed that, measured against Sumo Logic\u2019s longer-term execution risks, the per share price reflects a\nfair and favorable price for the shares of Sumo Logic common stock. The Sumo Logic Board also considered that\nthe per share price constitutes a premium of approximately 57 percent to Sumo Logic\u2019s unaffected closing stock\nprice on January 20, 2023, the last full trading day prior to media reports regarding a possible acquisition of\nSumo Logic.\n\u2022\nPotential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Sumo Logic Board that none of the possible\nalternatives to the merger (including the possibility of continuing to operate Sumo Logic as an independent\npublic company or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived risks of those\nalternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to Sumo Logic\u2019s stockholders of those alternatives and\nthe timing and likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities\nfor Sumo Logic to create greater value for Sumo Logic stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well\nas business, competitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory risks.\n\u2022\nFairness Opinion of Morgan Stanley. The oral opinion of Morgan Stanley, subsequently confirmed in writing,\nthat, as of February 9, 2023, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nin the written opinion, the per share consideration of $12.05 in cash to be received by the holders of shares of\nSumo Logic common stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement\nwas fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock. The opinion is\nmore fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\u201d\nand the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.\n\u2022\nNegotiations with Parent and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the merger agreement, which was\nthe product of arms\u2019-length negotiations, and the belief of the Sumo Logic Board that the merger agreement\ncontained terms that provided Sumo Logic with a high level of closing certainty. The factors considered\nincluded:\n\u25cb\nSumo Logic\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with,\nthird parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.\n\u25cb\nThe Sumo Logic Board\u2019s belief that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third\nparties from making a superior proposal.\n\u25cb\nThe Sumo Logic Board\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its recommendation\nthat Sumo Logic stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.\n\u25cb\nSumo Logic\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an\nalternative acquisition agreement. In that regard, the Sumo Logic Board believed that the termination fee\npayable by Sumo Logic in such instance was reasonable, consistent with or below similar fees payable in\ncomparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.\n\u25cb\nThe limited conditions to Parent\u2019s obligation to consummate the merger, making the merger reasonably\nlikely to be consummated.\n\u25cb\nSumo Logic\u2019s ability, under circumstances specified in the merger agreement and the equity commitment\nletter, to specifically enforce Parent\u2019s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded as contemplated\nby the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter.\n\u25cb\nThe commitment of the Guarantors to be obligated to fund the entire purchase price in the acquisition\npursuant to the terms of the equity commitment letter.\n\u2022\nReasonable Likelihood of Consummation. The belief of the Sumo Logic Board that an acquisition by Parent has\na reasonable likelihood of closing, including the Sumo Logic Board\u2019s belief that there was a reasonable\nlikelihood that the regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger would be obtained.\n\u2022\nBusiness Reputation of Francisco Partners. The Sumo Logic Board believed that the business reputation and\nfinancial resources of Francisco Partners were factors that supported the conclusion that a transaction with\nParent (which is owned by Francisco Partners) could be completed quickly and in an orderly manner, and had a\nsubstantial likelihood of being consummated successfully.\n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to Sumo Logic stockholders\n(including beneficial owners of shares of Sumo Logic common stock) who timely and properly exercise such\nappraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.\nThe Sumo Logic Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors\nrelated to its recommendation, including the following:\n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the merger as a cash transaction\nmeans that Sumo Logic stockholders will not participate in Sumo Logic\u2019s future earnings or growth and will not\nbenefit from any appreciation in value of the surviving corporation following the merger, whether as an\nindependent company or in combination with other Francisco Partners portfolio companies or assets. The Sumo\nLogic Board also considered the other potential alternative strategies available to Sumo Logic as an independent\ncompany, which, despite significant uncertainty, had the potential to result in a more successful and valuable\ncompany.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nNo Ability to Solicit an Alternative Transaction. The restrictions in the merger agreement on Sumo Logic\u2019s\nability to solicit competing proposals from the date of the merger agreement (subject to certain exceptions to\nallow the Sumo Logic Board to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a superior proposal, and then only\nupon the payment of the termination fee described below).\n\u2022\nTermination Fee Payable by Sumo Logic. The requirement that Sumo Logic pay Parent a termination fee of $52.0\nmillion under certain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement, including if the Sumo Logic\nBoard terminates the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal. The Sumo Logic Board considered the\npotentially dampening effect that this termination fee could have on a third party\u2019s interest in making a proposal\nto acquire Sumo Logic.\n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the merger might not be\nconsummated, and if it is not consummated, that: (1) Sumo Logic\u2019s directors, senior management and other\nemployees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant distractions from\ntheir work on behalf of Sumo Logic during the pendency of the merger\u037e (2) Sumo Logic will have incurred\nsignificant transaction and other costs\u037e (3) Sumo Logic\u2019s continuing business relationships with customers,\nbusiness partners and employees may be adversely affected\u037e (4) the trading price of Sumo Logic common stock\ncould be adversely affected\u037e (5) the other contractual and legal remedies available to Sumo Logic in the event of\nthe termination of the merger agreement may be insufficient, costly to pursue or both\u037e and (6) the failure of the\nmerger to be consummated could result in an adverse perception among Sumo Logic\u2019s current and prospective\ncustomers, employees and investors, which could cause an adverse impact on Sumo Logic\u2019s operating results.\n\u2022\nParent Liability Limitation. The fact that Parent\u2019s liabilities for monetary damages payable for breaches under\nthe merger agreement, or equity commitment letter are limited to $104.0 million.\n\u2022\nImpact of Interim Restrictions on Sumo Logic\u2019s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger. The\nrestrictions on Sumo Logic\u2019s conduct of its business prior to the consummation of the merger, which may delay\nor prevent Sumo Logic from undertaking strategic initiatives before the completion of the merger that, absent the\nmerger agreement, Sumo Logic might have pursued.\n\u2022\nEffects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the merger, including the: (1)\neffects on Sumo Logic\u2019s employees, customers, operating results and stock price\u037e (2) impact on Sumo Logic\u2019s\nability to attract and retain management, sales and marketing and technical personnel\u037e and (3) potential for\nlitigation in connection with the merger.\n\u2022\nTaxable Consideration. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Sumo Logic common stock in the merger\nwill be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for many Sumo Logic stockholders.\n\u2022\nInterests of Sumo Logic\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers. Interests that Sumo Logic\u2019s directors and executive\nofficers may have in the merger, which may be different from, or in addition to, those of Sumo Logic other\nstockholders.\nThis discussion is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it summarizes the material reasons and factors evaluated by the\nSumo Logic Board in its consideration of the merger. After considering these and other factors, the Sumo Logic\nBoard concluded that the potential benefits of entering into the merger agreement outweighed the uncertainties and\nrisks. In light of the variety of factors considered by the Sumo Logic Board and the complexity of these factors, the\nSumo Logic Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the\nforegoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Sumo Logic\nBoard applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different relative\nweights to the different factors. The Sumo Logic Board adopted and approved the merger agreement and the merger,\nand recommended that Sumo Logic stockholders adopt the merger agreement, based upon the totality of the\ninformation presented to, and considered by, the Sumo Logic Board. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set\nforth above may contain forward-looking statements, which should be read in conjunction with the section of this\nproxy statement captioned \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOpinion of Morgan Stanley & Co.

LLC\nSumo Logic retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and an opinion in connection with\nthe possible sale of Sumo Logic.

At the meeting of the\nSumo Logic Board on February 9, 2023, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing,\nthat, as of February 9, 2023, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in\nthe written opinion, the per share price of $12.05 in cash to be received by the holders of shares of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a\nfinancial point of view to such holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of February 9, 2023, which sets forth, among other\nthings, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the\nscope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as\nAnnex B and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.

With respect to the Projections,\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMorgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments of Sumo Logic management of the future financial performance of Sumo Logic. Morgan\nStanley expressed no view as to the Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan\nStanley assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement\nwithout any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent will\nobtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the equity commitment letter, and that the definitive merger\nagreement and equity commitment letter would not differ in any material respect from the drafts thereof furnished to\nMorgan Stanley on February 9, 2023. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the\nnecessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays,\nlimitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated\nbenefits expected to be derived in the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor.\nMorgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of\nSumo Logic and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters.

Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or\nliabilities of Sumo Logic, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan\nStanley\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to Morgan Stanley as of, February 9, 2023.

The following\nsummary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors\nconsidered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the\nrelative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include\ninformation presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley,\nthe tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete\ndescription of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a\nwhole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses and the factors considered, without considering all analyses and\nfactors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and was\ndirected by the Sumo Logic Board to rely upon, among other matters, (1) the Projections and (2) the average of\nestimates by equity research analysts as of February 8, 2023 (which we refer to as the \u201cstreet case\u201d), which included\nextrapolations for calendar year 2025 prepared by Morgan Stanley that were reviewed and approved for Morgan\nStanley\u2019s use by Sumo Logic management). For the purposes of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analyses presented to\nthe Sumo Logic Board on February 9, 2023 and this section, the fiscal years as set forth in the Projections are\nrepresented as calendar years, with each calendar year representing the subsequent fiscal year, such that, for\nexample, calendar year 2023 represents Sumo Logic\u2019s fiscal year 2024. The Projections are more fully described below\nin the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Projections.\u201d In accordance with direction from the Sumo Logic\nBoard, Morgan Stanley utilized the Projections and street case in its financial analyses described below.\nPublic Trading Comparables Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a\ncompany by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared\ncertain financial estimates for Sumo Logic with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst research\nestimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, that share\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsimilar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things,\nsimilarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar\noperating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the \u201ccomparable companies\u201d). These companies were\nthe following:\n\u2022\nAlteryx Inc.\n\u2022\nConfluent, Inc.\n\u2022\nDatadog Inc.\n\u2022\nDomo, Inc.\n\u2022\nDynatrace Inc.\n\u2022\nElastic NV\n\u2022\nEverbridge, Inc.\n\u2022\nFastly, Inc.\n\u2022\nFreshworks Inc.\n\u2022\nGitLab Inc.\n\u2022\nHashiCorp Inc.\n\u2022\nJFrog Ltd.\n\u2022\nNew Relic Inc.\n\u2022\nPagerDuty Inc.\n\u2022\nSplunk Inc.\n\u2022\nZuora, Inc.\nMorgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value (which we refer to as \u201cA\nV\u201d) for each of the comparable\ncompanies utilizing publicly available financial information as of February 8, 2023 to estimated revenue for each of\ncalendar years 2023 (which is referred to as \u201cCY23\u201d) and 2024 (which we refer to as \u201cCY24\u201d). Morgan Stanley\nreferred to these ratios as AV/CY2023E Revenue and AV/CY2024E Revenue, respectively. For purposes of its\nanalyses, Morgan Stanley defined \u201caggregate value\u201d as a company\u2019s fully diluted equity value plus total debt, less\ncash and cash equivalents.\nBased on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of AV/CY2023E Revenue of\n2.0x - 4.5x and AV/CY2024E Revenue of 2.0x - 4.0x and applied these ranges to the estimated revenue for Sumo Logic\nfor calendar years 2023 and 2024 based on each of the Projections and the street case.\nBased on the outstanding shares of Sumo Logic common stock on a fully diluted basis, as provided by Sumo Logic\nmanagement on February 3, 2023, and Sumo Logic\u2019s net cash as of February 3, 2023 as provided by Sumo Logic\nmanagement, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of Sumo Logic common stock as\nfollows:\nPublic Trading Multiples\nImplied Value per \nShare Range of \nSumo Logic\nCommon \nStock ($)\nAV / CY2023E Revenue\n \nstreet case\n7.26 - 13.12\nProjections\n7.18 - 12.94\nAV / CY2024E Revenue\n \nstreet case\n7.91 - 13.24\nProjections\n8.13 - 13.70\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNo company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to Sumo Logic. In evaluating the\ncomparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general\nbusiness, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Sumo\nLogic\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Sumo Logic\u2019s business and the\nindustry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and\nprospects of Sumo Logic and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as\ndetermining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into a theoretical\nestimate of the potential future equity value of a company\u2019s common stock as a function of such company\u2019s\nestimated future revenue and a range of trading multiples. The resulting estimated future implied equity value is\nsubsequently discounted back to the present day to arrive at an illustrative estimate of the present value for the\ncompany\u2019s theoretical future implied stock price. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range\nof implied present equity values per share of Sumo Logic common stock on a standalone basis for each of the\nProjections and the street case.\nMorgan Stanley calculated ranges of implied equity values per share of Sumo Logic common stock as of February 8,\n2023. To calculate the discounted equity value per share of Sumo Logic common stock, Morgan Stanley used\ncalendar year 2025 estimated revenue based on each of the Projections and the street case. For each scenario,\nMorgan Stanley calculated the future-implied fully diluted equity value of Sumo Logic as of February 8, 2025 (1) with\nrespect to the street case, by applying a representative range for the ratio of aggregate value to the estimated\nrevenue for calendar year 2025 of 2.0x - 4.5x to Sumo Logic\u2019s calendar year 2025 estimated revenue based on the street\ncase\u037e (2) with respect to the Projections, by applying a representative range for the ratio of aggregate value to\nestimated revenue for calendar year 2025 of 3.5x - 5.5x to Sumo Logic\u2019s calendar year 2025 estimated revenue based\nthe Projections and (3) in each case, adding Sumo Logic\u2019s future net cash estimate (with such estimates provided by\nSumo Logic management for the Projections and extrapolated for the street case (which extrapolations were reviewed\nand approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by Sumo Logic management)). In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided\nthe future implied fully diluted equity value by estimated future diluted shares outstanding to calculate a future\nequity value per share. Morgan Stanley discounted the resulting future equity values per share to February 8, 2023\nusing a discount rate equal to Sumo Logic\u2019s assumed cost of equity of 13.1 percent, which cost of equity was\nselected based on the application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. Based on these\ncalculations, this analysis implied the following value ranges per share of Sumo Logic common stock:\nForecast Scenario\nImplied Value\nper \nShare Range of \nSumo Logic \nCommon Stock\n($)\nstreet case\n5.91 - 11.15\nProjections\n10.47 - 15.31\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a\ncompany by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company.\nMorgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for Sumo Logic common stock based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis to value Sumo Logic as a stand-alone public company. Morgan Stanley utilized\nestimates from the Projections for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization, (1) less stock-based compensation expense\u037e (2) less taxes\u037e (3) less capital\nexpenditures\u037e and (4) plus or minus changes in net working capital, for calendar years 2023 through 2032, which\nestimated unlevered free cash flows were reviewed and approved by Sumo Logic management for Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nuse. The free cash flows and terminal value were then discounted, using a mid-year convention, to present values as\nof January 31, 2023, at a discount rate ranging from 12.1 percent to 14.1 percent, which discount rates were selected\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nupon the application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of Sumo\nLogic\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. The resulting aggregate value was then adjusted to add net cash as of\nFebruary 3, 2023 and further adjusted to add the net present value of net operating losses as provided by Sumo Logic\nmanagement.\nBased on the outstanding shares of Sumo Logic common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by Sumo Logic\nmanagement on February 3, 2023, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock as follows:\nForecast Scenario\nImplied Value\nPer \nShare Range of \nSumo Logic \nCommon Stock\n($)\nProjections\n8.86 -12.72\nIn mid-March 2023, subsequent to the rendering of its opinion to the Sumo Logic Board, Morgan Stanley determined\nand informed Sumo Logic management and the Sumo Logic Board that based on the adjustments to the Projections\nas described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Background of the Merger,\u201d the range of estimated\nimplied value per share of Sumo Logic common stock shown in the table immediately preceding this sentence would\nhave been $8.60 - $12.45, rather than the stated $8.86 - $12.72.\nPrecedent Transactions Multiples Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a\ncompany based on publicly available financial terms, by reviewing publicly available statistics for selected\ncomparable transactions. Such comparable transactions were selected because they shared certain characteristics\nwith the merger, most notably because they were similar software transactions. For each such transaction, Morgan\nStanley noted the ratio of aggregate value of the transaction to each of the target company\u2019s estimated revenue for\nthe next 12-month period following the announcement date of the applicable transaction (which we refer to as \u201cNTM\nRevenue\u201d).\nThe following is the list of such reviewed transactions:\nSelected Precedent Transactions (Target/Acquiror)\nAV / NTM \nREVENUE\nCarbon Black / VMware\n8.0x\nCision / Platinum Equity\n3.5x\nCloudera / CD&R - KKR\n5.3x\nDuck Creek Technologies / Vista Equity Partners\n6.9x\nEllie Mae / Thoma Bravo\n6.8x\nEndurance International/ Clearlake CapitalGroup\n2.7x\nForescout / Advent International, Crosspoint Capital\n4.9x\nForgeRock, Inc. / Thoma Bravo\n8.3x\nImprivata / Thoma Bravo\n3.5x\ninContact / NICE\n3.5x\nMobileIron / IvantiSoftware\n4.1x\nOPOWER / Oracle\n3.3x\nPluralsight / Vista Equity\n7.8x\nQAD / Thoma Bravo\n5.3x\nRosetta Stone /Cambium Learning\n3.9x\nTalend / Thoma Bravo\n7.3x\nUserTesting, Inc. / Thoma Bravo\n5.3x\nXactly / Vista Equity\n4.7x\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable transactions and upon the application of its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges for the ratio of aggregate\nvalue to the estimated NTM Revenue of 3.0x to 7.0x and applied these ranges to Sumo Logic\u2019s estimated NTM\nRevenue as of February 8, 2023, based on the street case to calculate a range of implied equity values per share of\nSumo Logic common stock. The results of the analysis were as follows:\nPrecedent Transaction\nImplied Value\nper \nShare Range of \nSumo Logic \nCommon Stock\n($)\nstreet case\n9.60 - 18.98\nNo company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to Sumo Logic or the merger. In\nevaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of\nwhich are beyond Sumo Logic\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Sumo\nLogic\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the\nfinancial condition and prospects of Sumo Logic and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which\ncould affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the\ntransactions to which the merger is being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present value per\nshare of Sumo Logic derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the per share\nprice in connection with the merger is not necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis of\nthe consideration for the merger, but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.\nOther Information\nMorgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered as part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analysis\nwith respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Sumo Logic Board.\nIllustrative Precedent Transaction Premiums\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the premiums paid by acquirers in selected public company technology transactions\noccurring between 2011 and February 8, 2023, with aggregate values greater than $250 million. Morgan Stanley\nselected such public company technology transactions because of certain shared characteristics with the merger\nbased on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. For each transaction in the analyses, Morgan\nStanley noted, where available: (1) the implied premium to the acquired company\u2019s closing share price on the last\ntrading day prior to announcement (or, as applicable, on the last trading day prior to the share price being affected by\nacquisition rumors or similar merger-related news)\u037e and (2) the implied premium to the acquired company\u2019s 30-day\naverage closing share price prior to announcement (or, as applicable, the last trading day prior to the share price\nbeing affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news).\nMorgan Stanley also reviewed the premiums paid by acquirers in such selected public company technology\ntransactions since the beginning of 2022 as an indication of premiums paid on recent technology transactions. For\neach transaction in the analysis, Morgan Stanley noted, where available, the implied premium to the acquired\ncompany\u2019s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or, as applicable, on the last trading\nday prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news).\nBased on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment\nand experience, Morgan Stanley selected (1) a representative range of premia based on the selected transactions\noccurring between 2011 and February 8, 2023 and applied such range to Sumo Logic\u2019s closing share price on January\n20, 2023 (the last trading day prior to public rumors regarding a potential transaction)\u037e (2) a representative range of\npremia based on the selected transactions occurring between 2011 and February 8, 2023 and applied such range to\nSumo Logic\u2019s closing share price during the 30 trading days prior to and including January 20, 2023\u037e and (3) a\nrepresentative range of premia based on the selected transactions occurring since the beginning of 2022 and applied\nsuch range to Sumo Logic\u2019s closing share price on January 20, 2023.\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table summarizes such calculations:\nPrecedent Transaction Premium Scenario\nRepresentative\nPremium \nRanges\nImplied Value per \nShare Range of \nSumo Logic\nCommon \nStock ($)\nPremia to 1-Day Unaffected Share Price\n20% - 50%\n9.20 - 11.51\nPremia to 30-Day Average Unaffected Share Price\n20% - 50%\n9.51 - 11.89\nPremia to 1-Day Unaffected Share Price (2022 Transaction Premia Range)\n30% - 75%\n9.97 - 13.42\nHistorical Trading Ranges\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the historical trading range of Sumo Logic common stock for the 30-, 90- and 365-day\nperiods ending on January 20, 2023. The ranges were as follows:\nHistorical Trading Periods\nHistorical Per Share\nRange \nof Sumo \nLogic Common Stock\n($)\nLast 30 Days ending on January 20, 2023\n7.36 - 8.91\nLast 90 Days ending on January 20, 2023\n6.60 - 8.91\nLast 365 Days ending on January 20, 2023\n6.60 - 12.67\nEquity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets\nMorgan Stanley reviewed publicly available equity research analysts\u2019 share price targets for Sumo Logic common\nstock as of January 20, 2023. Morgan Stanley used the lowest and highest undiscounted price targets issued by\nthose research analysts with publicly available price targets for shares of Sumo Logic, resulting in a range of $8.50 to\n$18.00 per share of Sumo Logic common stock, with a median of $10.00 per share.\nMorgan Stanley then calculated the range of discounted price targets for Sumo Logic by discounting such targets for\none year. Based on an estimated cost of equity of 13.1 percent for Sumo Logic, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of\ndiscounted price targets of $7.51 to $15.91 per share of Sumo Logic common stock, with a median of $8.84 per share.\nThe public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current\nmarket trading prices for Sumo Logic common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the\nfuture financial performance of Sumo Logic and future financial market conditions.\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the merger by the Sumo Logic Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of\nfinancial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of an opinion is a complex\nprocess and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion,\nMorgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to\nany analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without\nconsidering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and\nopinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other\nanalyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As\na result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s view of the actual value of Sumo Logic.\nIn performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous judgments and assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of\nwhich are beyond Sumo Logic\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Sumo\nLogic\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the\nfinancial condition and prospects of Sumo Logic and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any\nestimates contained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial\npoint of view of the per share price of $12.05 in cash to be received by the holders of shares of Sumo Logic common\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement and in connection with the\ndelivery of its opinion dated as of February 9, 2023, to the Sumo Logic Board. These analyses do not purport to be\nappraisals or reflect the prices at which shares of Sumo Logic common stock might actually trade.\nThe aggregate per share price to be received by the holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock (other than as\nspecified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement was determined through arm\u2019s-length\nnegotiations between Sumo Logic and Francisco Partners and was approved by the Sumo Logic Board. Morgan\nStanley provided financial advice to the Sumo Logic Board during these negotiations but did not, however,\nrecommend any specific consideration to Sumo Logic or the Sumo Logic Board, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that\nany specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion\ndid not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other\nalternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was\nnot intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how our stockholders should vote at\nthe special meeting.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Sumo Logic Board were among the many factors taken into\nconsideration by the Sumo Logic Board to recommend that the Sumo Logic Board approve and adopt the merger\nagreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of\nthe Sumo Logic Board with respect to the consideration pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Sumo\nLogic Board would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved\nby a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley\u2019s\ncustomary practice.\nThe Sumo Logic Board retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, experience and\nexpertise. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and\nindividual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and\nbrokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, and prime brokerage, as well as\nproviding investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and\nofficers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance\npositions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their\ncustomers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Sumo Logic, Parent, Francisco Partners or its affiliates and their\naffiliated funds\u2019 respective portfolio companies (which are referred to collectively herein as the \u201cFrancisco Partners\nRelated Entities\u201d) and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be\ninvolved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors or\nofficers, including individuals working with Sumo Logic in connection with the merger, may have committed and may\ncommit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by Francisco Partners, or the Francisco Partners\nRelated Entities or in affiliates of Morgan Stanley that may hold direct equity and/or partnership interests in private\nequity funds managed by Francisco Partners or the Francisco Partners Related Entities.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Sumo Logic Board financial advisory services\nand an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the\nmerger, and Sumo Logic has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $29.0 million for its services, $6.0\nmillion of which was earned following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached to this proxy\nstatement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Sumo Logic\nhas also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other\nprofessional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, Sumo Logic has agreed to indemnify\nMorgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other\nperson, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain losses, claims, damages, liabilities\nand expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement, including certain\nliabilities under the federal securities laws.\nIn the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have not provided\nfinancial advisory or financing services to Sumo Logic and have not received any fees for such services from Sumo\nLogic. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have\nprovided financial advisory and financing services to Francisco Partners and certain of its majority-controlled\naffiliates and\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nhave received aggregate fees of less than approximately $1.0 million in connection with such services. Morgan\nStanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Sumo Logic, Francisco Partners or the\nFrancisco Partners Related Entities and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the\nrendering of these services.\nProjections",

            "text": "Projections\nOther than in connection with Sumo Logic\u2019s regular earnings press releases and related investor materials, and in\nconnection with its investor day, Sumo Logic does not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to its future\nfinancial performance, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the\nunderlying assumptions and estimates. However, Sumo Logic management regularly prepares, and the Sumo Logic\nBoard regularly evaluates, prospective financial information relating to Sumo Logic\u2019s future performance as part of its\nlong-term business planning. Sumo Logic management regularly makes and reviews with the Sumo Logic Board\nupdates to its long-term business plan, including to reflect actual results and trends and changes in Sumo Logic\u2019s\nperformance and the industry in which it operates.\nAs part of Sumo Logic\u2019s evaluation of strategic alternatives (including continuing as an independent public\ncompany), Sumo Logic management prepared and reviewed with the Corporate Governance Committee and the Sumo\nLogic Board unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2024 through 2026 contained in the January\n2023 long-range plan, together with extrapolations for fiscal years 2027 through 2033 (the \u201cextrapolations\u201d). The\nextrapolations for fiscal year 2027 were prepared by Sumo Logic management. The extrapolations for fiscal years 2028\nthrough 2033 were prepared by Morgan Stanley at the direction of the Corporate Governance Committee and were\nreviewed and approved by Sumo Logic management. For purposes of this proxy statement, we refer to the unaudited\nprospective financial information for fiscal years 2024 through 2026 contained in the January 2023 long-range plan,\ntogether with the extrapolations, as the \u201cProjections.\u201d The Projections were prepared for internal use only and not\nfor public disclosure and were provided by Sumo Logic management to the Corporate Governance Committee and the\nSumo Logic Board for the purposes of their consideration, analyses and evaluation of the merger and other strategic\nalternatives.\nAt the direction of the Sumo Logic Board, the Projections were used by Morgan Stanley for purposes of performing\nits financial analyses in connection with rendering its opinion to the Sumo Logic Board (as more fully described in\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\u201d). In addition, a subset of the\nunaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2024 through 2026 contained in the January 2023 long-\nrange plan were provided to Francisco Partners prior to the execution of the merger agreement, and to certain other\npotential acquirors, as part of acquisition discussions and to assist in their respective due diligence review during\nSumo Logic\u2019s strategic review process. For more information on the preparation and use of the Projections, please\nsee the sections of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Background of the Merger\u201d and \u201c-Opinion of Morgan Stanley &\nCo. LLC.\u201d\nThe Projections were prepared and/or approved by, and are the sole responsibility of, Sumo Logic management. At\nSumo Logic\u2019s direction, Morgan Stanley relied on the accuracy and completeness of the Projections utilized in its\nfinancial analyses and its advice to the Sumo Logic Board, as well as the assurances of Sumo Logic management that\n(1) it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading\u037e and (2)\nthe Projections were reasonably prepared and/or approved based on the best currently available estimates and\njudgments of Sumo Logic management of the future financial performance of Sumo Logic.\nThe Projections were developed and/or approved by Sumo Logic management as then-current estimates of Sumo\nLogic\u2019s future financial performance as an independent public company. The Projections do not give effect to the\nmerger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the merger agreement, the expenses that have already\nand will be incurred in connection with completing the merger, or any changes to Sumo Logic\u2019s operations or strategy\nthat may be implemented in connection with the pendency of, or following the consummation of, the merger. The\nProjections also do not consider the effect of any failure of the merger to be completed\u037e the Projections should not be\nviewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe Projections constitute forward-looking statements. The Projections are not included in this proxy statement to\ninfluence any decision on whether to vote for the merger proposal or any other proposal presented at the special\nmeeting, but rather are included in this proxy statement to give stockholders access to certain non-public information\nthat was provided to the Corporate Governance Committee, the Sumo Logic Board and Morgan Stanley for the\npurposes described above. By including the Projections in this proxy statement, none of the Corporate Governance\n57TABLE OF CONTENTS\nCommittee, the Sumo Logic Board, Sumo Logic, Sumo Logic management, Morgan Stanley or any person has made or\nmakes any representation to any person regarding Sumo Logic\u2019s ultimate performance as compared to the information\ncontained in the Projections. The inclusion of the Projections should not be regarded as an indication that the\nCorporate Governance Committee, the Sumo Logic Board, Sumo Logic, Sumo Logic management, Morgan Stanley or\nany other person considered, or now considers such information to be necessarily predictive of Sumo Logic\u2019s actual\nfuture results, and such information should not be relied on as such. Further, the inclusion of the Projections in this\nproxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Sumo Logic that the information presented is\nmaterial.\nThe Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d). In addition, the Projections were not prepared with a view\ntoward complying with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of\nCertified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. Sumo Logic\u2019s\nindependent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has not audited, reviewed, examined,\ncompiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying Projections and, accordingly,\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Sumo Logic\u2019s\npreviously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the Projections and should not be read to do so.\nAlthough the Projections are presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates as\nto future events made by Sumo Logic management that Sumo Logic management believed in good faith were\nreasonable at the time that the Projections were prepared. Sumo Logic\u2019s ability to achieve the financial results\ncontemplated by the Projections will be affected by its ability to achieve its strategic goals, objectives and targets\nover the applicable periods, and will be subject to related operational and execution risks. The Projections reflect\nassumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual\nresults and cause the Projections not to be achieved can be found in the risk factors included in Sumo Logic\u2019s\nperiodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of Sumo\nLogic\u2019s control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Projections will be realized, and Sumo Logic\u2019s actual\nresults may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Projections. For information on factors that may\ncause Sumo Logic\u2019s future results to materially vary, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cForward-\nLooking Statements.\u201d The Projections may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and do not consider\nany events or circumstances after the date that they were prepared, including the announcement of the entry into the\nmerger agreement. You should evaluate the Projections, if at all, in conjunction with Sumo Logic\u2019s historical financial\nstatements and other information regarding Sumo Logic contained in Sumo Logic\u2019s public filings with the SEC. The\nProjections may not be consistent with Sumo Logic\u2019s historical operating data as a result of the assumptions utilized\nin preparing such information. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, Sumo Logic does\nnot intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such\ninformation was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events.\nBecause the Projections reflect estimates and judgments, they are susceptible to sensitivities and assumptions, as\nwell as to multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The Projections also cover\nmultiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The\nProjections are not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the\nProjections are not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of Sumo Logic\u2019s future results\nor for purposes of making any investment decision.\nCertain of the financial measures included in the Projections are non-GAAP financial measures (which we refer to as\nthe \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d). These are financial performance measures that are not calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nFurthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits\nthat are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be\nconsidered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a\nbusiness combination transaction, such as the Projections, are excluded from the definition of \u201cnon-GAAP financial\nmeasures\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Projections are not subject to SEC rules\nregarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures were not provided to or relied upon by the Corporate Governance Committee, the Sumo Logic Board,\nMorgan Stanley or any other person. Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the\nProjections is provided in this proxy statement.\nIn preparing and approving the Projections, Sumo Logic management utilized the following material assumptions.\nSumo Logic management using its business judgement, believed in good faith that these assumptions were\nreasonable:\n\u2022\nA decline in revenue growth to 14 percent in fiscal year 2024 before reaccelerating to 21 percent and 26\npercent in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, respectively. These assumptions reflect expected future productivity\nimprovements from Sumo Logic\u2019s sales team in addition to incremental capacity. In addition, these growth\nrates assume marginal improvements in the renewal rate of existing customer contracts from approximately\n89 percent in fiscal year 2024 to 92 percent by fiscal year 2026.\n\u2022\nConsistent EBIT growth from fiscal year 2024 through fiscal year 2026 as a result of realizing future\nefficiencies as Sumo Logic\u2019s business scales. In addition, EBIT margin ranging from negative 10 percent in\nfiscal year 2024 to 7 percent in fiscal year 2026.

Additionally, concurrently\nwith the execution of the merger agreement, Sumo Logic\u2019s directors, in their capacities as stockholders of Sumo\nLogic, entered into the voting agreements with Parent and Sumo Logic. The voting agreements obligate these\npersons to vote their respective shares of Sumo Logic common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger\nagreement and for any proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting to a later date if Sumo Logic or Parent\nproposes or requests such postponement or adjournment in accordance with the merger agreement, and against any\naction, agreement, or proposal that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or materially delay\nthe consummation of the merger. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement\u037e (2) approving the merger\nagreement and the merger\u037e and (3) recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by Sumo Logic\u2019s\nstockholders, the Sumo Logic Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the\ntime, among other matters.

The following summary does not constitute any\nlegal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Sumo Logic\u2019s stockholders exercise their\nappraisal rights under Section 262. STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FULL TEXT OF\nSECTION 262 AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION DISCUSSED BELOW. \nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of Sumo Logic common stock or beneficial\nowners who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares of Sumo Logic common stock to\nSumo Logic prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) do not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor\nof the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (3) continuously hold of record or beneficially own such shares on the date\nof making the demand for appraisal through the effective time of the merger\u037e and (4) otherwise comply with the\nprocedures and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of\nSumo Logic common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash, in lieu of\nthe consideration set forth in the merger agreement, for the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Sumo Logic common stock,\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective time of the merger through the\ndate of payment of the judgment (or in certain circumstances described herein, on the difference between the amount\ndetermined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation in the merger to each person\nentitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding) as described further below. However,\nafter an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine persons entitled\nto appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of shares of a class or series of stock that,\nimmediately prior to the closing of the merger, were listed on a national securities exchange who are otherwise entitled\nto appraisal rights unless (A) the total number of shares of the class or series of stock for which appraisal rights have\nbeen pursued or perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of such class or series as measured in\naccordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (B) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares\nexceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the \u201cownership thresholds.\u201d Given that the shares of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock are listed on the Nasdaq (and assuming such shares remain so listed up until closing of the merger),\nthen the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all holders of Sumo Logic common\nstock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is satisfied.\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on the\namount determined to be the fair value of the shares subject to appraisal will accrue and compound quarterly from the\neffective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount\nrate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time before\nthe entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person\nentitled to appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount\nso paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest theretofore\naccrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash\npayment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record\ndate for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or\ninformation directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naccessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes Sumo Logic\u2019s notice to Sumo Logic\u2019s\nstockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is\navailable at the following URL: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with\nthe merger, any holder of shares of Sumo Logic common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes\nto preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the\nrequirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nA person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the\nmerger agreement less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising\nthe right to seek appraisal of shares of Sumo Logic common stock, Sumo Logic believes that if a person is\nconsidering exercising such rights, such person should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders or beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nsuch person must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch person must deliver to Sumo Logic a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger\nagreement at the special meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch person must continuously hold of record or beneficially own the shares of Sumo Logic common stock\nfrom the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a person will lose appraisal\nrights if the person transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger)\u037e and\n\u2022\nsuch person or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding\na determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of\nthe merger (the surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of\ndoing so).\nIn addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine\npersons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who asserted appraisal rights\nwith respect to the shares of Sumo Logic common stock unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe merger agreement, each person who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote\nagainst the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain.\nFiling Written Demand\nA person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Sumo Logic, before the vote on the adoption of the\nmerger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person\u2019s shares. In addition, that\nperson must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the\nadoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by mail or via the internet or\ntelephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any\npreviously filed written demands for appraisal. A person exercising appraisal rights must hold or own, as applicable,\nbeneficially or of record, the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold or\nown, as applicable, the shares through the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not\ncontain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will\nconstitute a waiver of the stockholder\u2019s and beneficial owner\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously\ndelivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or\nabstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger\nagreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of\nitself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for\nappraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A\nproxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a demand. A person\u2019s failure to make\nthe written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will\nconstitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a stockholder of record, the demand must reasonably inform\nSumo Logic of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s shares. In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a beneficial owner, the demand must\nreasonably identify the record holder of the shares for which the demand is made, be accompanied by documentary\nevidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of such stock and a statement that such documentary\nevidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at which such beneficial owner\nconsents to receive notices given by the surviving corporation and to be set forth on the verified list (as defined\nbelow).\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nSumo Logic, Inc.\n855 Main Street, Suite 100\nRedwood City, California 94063\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and accept\nthe per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement, less any applicable withholding taxes, by delivering to\nSumo Logic, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person without the\napproval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the\nDelaware Court of Chancery deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction (which we refer to\nas a \u201creservation\u201d) for any application (as defined below)\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of\nany person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw\nsuch person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time of\nthe merger. If the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect\nto a person, such person will be entitled to receive only the fair value determined in any such appraisal proceeding,\nwhich value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered pursuant to the merger\nagreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify\neach stockholder (including any beneficial owner) of each constituent corporation who has properly made a written\ndemand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger\nagreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective time thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any person who\nhas complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an\nappraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving\ncorporation in the case of a petition filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving\ncorporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not\nassume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of\nthe shares of Sumo Logic common stock. Accordingly, any persons who desire to have their shares appraised should\ninitiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Sumo Logic common stock\nwithin the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period\nspecified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for an\nappraisal of such person\u2019s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nsurviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe merger agreement and with respect to which Sumo Logic has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that where a beneficial owner\nmakes a demand for appraisal directly, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate\nstockholder holding such shares for purposes of this aggregate number). Such statement must be given within ten\ndays after\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreceipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration\nof the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy\nthereof must be made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after such service\nto file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the \u201cverified list\u201d) containing\nthe names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as\nto the value of their shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time\nand place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given to the surviving corporation and all of the persons shown on\nthe verified list at the addresses stated therein. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.\nAfter notice is provided to the applicable persons as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, at the hearing on\nsuch petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the persons who have complied with Section 262 and\nwho have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the persons\nwho demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by stock certificates to submit their stock\ncertificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any\nperson fails to comply with this requirement, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such\nperson. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal\nproceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final\ndetermination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the verified list may\nparticipate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights\nunder Section 262.\nGiven that the shares common stock are listed on the Nasdaq (and assuming such shares remain so listed up until\nclosing of the merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all holders of\nshares of Sumo Logic common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the ownership\nthresholds is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the persons entitled to appraisal and, with respect to Sumo Logic\ncommon stock, that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of persons seeking\nappraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Sumo Logic common stock, exclusive of\nany element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be\npaid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective time of the merger through the date of\npayment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time\nof the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time\nprior to the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to\neach person seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection\n(h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount paid\nby the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.\nUOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in\nan appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the\ndate of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair\nvalue is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In\nCede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that]\ndoes\n69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnot encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising\nfrom such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements\nof future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nmerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive\npursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm\nas to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and\nmay not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. ALTHOUGH SUMO LOGIC BELIEVES THAT THE\nPER SHARE PRICE IS FAIR, NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THE APPRAISAL OF\nFAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY, AND STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD\nRECOGNIZE THAT SUCH AN APPRAISAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERMINATION OF A VALUE HIGHER OR\nLOWER THAN, OR THE SAME AS, THE PER SHARE PRICE. Neither Sumo Logic nor Parent anticipates offering\nmore than the per share price to any persons exercising appraisal rights, and each of Sumo Logic and Parent reserves\nthe rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Sumo Logic common stock is less than the\nper share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or, with respect to Sumo Logic common stock, if neither of\nthe ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of persons seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an\nappraisal will cease.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any,\nby the surviving corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such person upon such\nterms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be\nenforced as other decrees in such Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced.\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts)\nmay be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndeems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the verified list who\nparticipated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith (which we refer to as an \u201capplication\u201d),\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the\nshares entitled to an appraisal that were not dismissed pursuant to the terms of Section 262 or subject to an award\npursuant to a reservation. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Sumo Logic common stock under Section 262 fails to\nperfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of Sumo Logic common\nstock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the per share\nprice as provided in the merger agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such person\u2019s right to\nappraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the\nownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares\nof Sumo Logic common stock, or if the person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such\nperson\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in\naccordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the effective time of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with\nSection 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of Sumo Logic common stock for any purpose or to receive payment\nof dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of\nrecord at a date which is prior to the effective time of the merger)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an\nappraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been\nsatisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Sumo Logic common stock, or if\nsuch person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person\u2019s demand for an appraisal and\nan acceptance of the merger, within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, then the right of such person to an\nappraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will\nbe dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsuch terms as the Court deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing\nshall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as\na named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger\nwithin 60 days after the effective time of the merger.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of appraisal rights.\nIn that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the\nmerger agreement, less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any person wishing to exercise appraisal\nrights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be\nrelevant to U.S. holders and Non-U.S. holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock whose shares are converted\ninto the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d), U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court\ndecisions, published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d), and other\napplicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or\ndiffering interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares\nof Sumo Logic common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, as\nproperty held for investment purposes). With respect to holders whose shares of Sumo Logic common stock were\nsubject to vesting restrictions at the time such shares were acquired, if any, this discussion assumes that a valid and\ntimely election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code was made with respect to such shares.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may\nbe relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who received their shares of Sumo Logic common stock in a compensatory\ntransaction or pursuant to the exercise of Sumo Logic options, or Sumo Logic RSUs, or otherwise in\nconnection with the performance of services\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S.\nfederal income tax laws, such as financial institutions\u037e tax-exempt organizations\u037e S corporations,\npartnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes\u037e insurance companies\u037e mutual funds\u037e dealers in stocks and securities\u037e traders\nin securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities\u037e regulated\ninvestment companies\u037e real estate investment trusts\u037e entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules\u037e\nholders who hold their common stock as \u201cqualified small business stock\u201d for purposes of Sections 1045\nand 1202 of the Code, as \u201cSection 1244 stock\u201d within the meaning of Section 1244 of the Code, or through\nindividual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts\u037e Non-U.S. holders that own (directly or by attribution)\nmore than five percent of Sumo Logic common stock\u037e or U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-\nterm residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders holding shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle,\nor other risk reduction transaction\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to U.S. holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other\nentity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income\nwith respect to the shares of Sumo Logic common stock being taken into account in an \u201capplicable\nfinancial statement\u201d (as defined in the Code)\u037e\n\u2022\nany U.S. federal estate, gift, or alternative minimum tax consequences\u037e\n71TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nany state, local, or non-U.S. tax consequences\u037e or\n\u2022\ntax consequences to persons that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of\ntheir shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Sumo Logic common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner\nin such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the\npartnership. Partnerships holding shares of Sumo Logic common stock and partners therein should consult their tax\nadvisors regarding the consequences of the merger.\nNo ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger\ndescribed below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would\nultimately prevail in a final determination by a court. Further, no opinion of counsel has been or will be rendered with\nrespect to the tax consequences of the merger or related transactions.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE\nLEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE\nU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS\nOR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.\nU.S. Holders\nGeneral\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Sumo Logic common stock that is\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of\none or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) has a valid election\nin effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.\nTaxable Sale of Company Capital Stock\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Sumo Logic common stock pursuant to the merger will\nbe a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal\nto the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares\nsurrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.\nholder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if\nsuch U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A\nreduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. holder (including\nindividuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of\nshares of Sumo Logic common stock at different times and/or different prices, such holder must determine its\nadjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Sumo Logic common stock.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nGeneral\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Sumo Logic common stock\nthat is neither a U.S. holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n72\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTaxable Sale of Company Capital Stock\nSubject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below) withholding, any gain realized\nby a Non-U.S. holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. holder in the United States\n(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained\nby such Non-U.S. holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. holder is a corporation,\nsuch gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an\napplicable income tax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case\nsuch gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an\napplicable income tax treaty)\u037e or\n\u2022\nSumo Logic is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is defined in\nSection 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as \u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the shorter of the five-year\nperiod preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable shares\nof Sumo Logic common stock (which we refer to as the \u201crelevant period\u201d) and, if shares of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section\n897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five\npercent of Sumo Logic common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first\nbullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if\nthe fair market value of its U.S. real property interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50 percent\nof the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held\nfor use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real property interests generally include land,\nimprovements and associated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we\nbelieve that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the\nmerger. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible consequences\nto them if we are a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds received by\na holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. holder that furnishes a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS\nForm W-9 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (2) a Non-U.S. holder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-\nU.S. holder\u2019s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (b)\notherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nA U.S. holder may be required to retain records related to such holder\u2019s common stock and file with its U.S. federal\nincome tax return, for the taxable year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the\nmerger.\nAdditional Withholding Requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance issued\nthereunder (which we refer to as, collectively, \u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on\ncertain payments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under these rules) unless such\ninstitution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and\nprovide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution\n(which include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign\nentities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30\npercent on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding\n73\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nagent a certification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An\nintergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these\nrequirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would\neliminate the FATCA withholding applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may\ngenerally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nHolders of Sumo Logic common stock are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible\nimplications of FATCA on the disposition of Sumo Logic common stock pursuant to the merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE INCLUDED FOR GENERAL\nINFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES MAY DIFFER, EACH U.S. HOLDER AND NON-U.S. HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT SUCH\nHOLDER\u2019S TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE RULES DISCUSSED ABOVE TO\nSUCH HOLDER AND THE PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION\nAND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.",

At\nany time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, any state could take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action\ncould include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Sumo\nLogic or Parent. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain\ncircumstances.\nSubject to the terms of the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective controlled\naffiliates, if applicable) agreed to, if and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the merger pursuant to the HSR\nAct and any other antitrust laws or specified foreign direct investment laws applicable to the merger, promptly take\nany and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances,\nconsents, approvals, and waivers under antitrust laws or specified foreign direct investment laws (that may be\nrequired by any governmental authority, so as to enable to parties to consummate the merger as soon as reasonably\npracticable)\u037e including (1) offering, negotiating, committing to or effecting, by settlement, consent decree, hold\nseparate order, stipulation, or otherwise (a) the sale, divestiture, license, or other disposition, of any and all of the\ncapital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, properties, products\nor business of Parent and Merger Sub and their respective controlled affiliates, if applicable, on the one hand, and\nSumo Logic on the other hand\u037e (b) the termination, modification, or assignment of existing relationships, joint\nventures, contracts, or obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, and their respective controlled affiliates, if applicable,\non the one hand, or Sumo Logic and its controlled affiliates on the other hand\u037e (c) committing to behavioral or other\noperational conditions and any other modifications of, or restrictions on the businesses, assets, priorities, product\nlines, equity interest, or other activities of Parent and Merger Sub and their respective subsidiaries, if applicable, on\nthe one hand, and Sumo Logic and its controlled affiliates on the other hand\u037e and (2) contesting, defending, and\nappealing any pending or threatened legal proceeding challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the\nmerger and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any order, whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent,\nthat prohibits, prevents, or restricts the consummation of the merger.\nOne or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement, or limitation when it\ngrants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory\nprocess or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even\npreclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain\nall of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a\nsubstantial period of time between the approval by Sumo Logic\u2019s stockholders and the completion of the merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that\nthese regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained in a timely manner, obtained at all, or that the granting of\nthese regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion\nof the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement.

The rights and obligations of the\nparties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement, and not by this summary or any other\ninformation contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations, and\nsupplemental information agreed to by Sumo Logic, Parent, and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from\nthose generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by\nconfidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Sumo Logic in connection with the merger agreement.\nIn addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of\nallocating contractual risk between Sumo Logic and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as\nfacts. Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise.\nSumo Logic\u2019s stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not\nrely on the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations\nof the actual state of facts or condition of Sumo Logic, Parent, or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses.

The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to\nprovide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual\ninformation regarding Sumo Logic, Parent, Merger Sub, or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants, and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone,\nand you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in Sumo Logic\u2019s filings with the SEC\nregarding Sumo Logic and Sumo Logic\u2019s business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub, and Sumo Logic that is no\nlater than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last condition to the closing of the merger\n(other than those conditions that by their term are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the\nsatisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement) of such conditions)\u037e or (2) at such other\ntime agreed to by Sumo Logic, Parent, and Merger Sub.

At or prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the\npayment agent an amount of cash that is sufficient in the aggregate to pay the aggregate per share price payable to\nSumo Logic\u2019s stockholders and warrantholders in accordance with the merger agreement.\nPromptly (and in any event within one business day) following the effective time of the merger, Parent and the\nsurviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the\neffective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented\noutstanding shares of Sumo Logic common stock (other than excluded shares), a letter of transmittal and instructions\nadvising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates in exchange for merger consideration. Upon receipt of (1)\nsurrendered certificates for cancellation (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together\nwith any required bond)\u037e and (2) a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may\nbe reasonably requested by the payment agent, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive an amount in\ncash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock represented by such\ncertificate and (y) the per share price. The amount of any per share price paid to Sumo Logic\u2019s stockholders will not\ninclude interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of Sumo Logic common stock held in book-entry form (which\nwe refer to as \u201cuncertificated shares\u201d) will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal\n(as both are described above) to the payment agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof. Each\nholder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of uncertificated shares that immediately\nprior to the effective time of the merger represented an outstanding share of Sumo Logic common stock will, upon\nreceipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d in customary form at the effective time of the merger, and any documents as may\nreasonably be requested by the payment agent, be entitled to receive, and the payment agent will pay and deliver as\npromptly as practicable, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Sumo Logic\ncommon stock represented by such holder\u2019s transferred uncertificated shares\u037e and (2) the per share price. The\namount of consideration paid to such Sumo Logic stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any\napplicable withholding taxes.\nIf any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the\nmerger, such cash will be returned to Parent upon demand, and any of Sumo Logic\u2019s stockholders and warrantholders\nas of immediately prior to the merger who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the merger agreement\nwill thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of payment of the merger consideration (subject to abandoned\nproperty law, escheat law or similar laws). None of the payment agent, Parent, the surviving corporation, or any other\nparty will be liable to any of Sumo Logic\u2019s stockholders with respect to any cash amounts properly paid to a public\nofficial pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar laws.\nThe letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has\nbeen stolen or destroyed. In the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, then the\npayment agent will issue the per share price to such holder upon the making by such holder of an affidavit for such\nlost, stolen or destroyed certificate. Parent or the payment agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to\nthe payment of the per share price, require such stockholder to deliver a bond in such amount as Parent or the\npayment agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the surviving corporation\nor the payment agent with respect to such certificate.\nRepresentations and Warranties",

The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set\nforth in the Merger Agreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the\nCompany Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair\nfrom a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the Company Common Stock.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:\n1) Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of\nthe Company\u037e\n2) Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the\nCompany\u037e\n3) Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company and certain\nextrapolations prepared with guidance from the management of the Company (which were reviewed and\napproved by you for our use) (collectively, the \u201cFinancial Projections\u201d)\u037e\n4) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company\nwith senior executives of the Company\u037e\n5) Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock\u037e\n6) Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company\nCommon Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the Company, and their\nsecurities\u037e\n7) Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition\ntransactions\u037e\n8) Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and Parent\nand their financial and legal advisors\u037e\n9) Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the draft equity commitment letter from Francisco Partners VI, L.P.,\nFrancisco Partners VI-A, L.P., Francisco Partners VI-B, L.P., Francisco Partners VI-C, L.P. and Francisco Partners\nVI-D, L.P. to Parent, substantially in the form of the draft dated February 9, 2023 (the \u201cEquity Commitment\nLetter\u201d) and certain related documents\u037e and\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\n10) Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as\nwe have deemed appropriate.\nWe have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a\nsubstantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the Financial Projections, we have assumed that they have been\nreasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of\nthe Company of the future financial performance of the Company. We express no view as to such Financial\nProjections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or\ndelay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with\nthe terms set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, and that the definitive Merger Agreement and Equity\nCommitment Letter will not differ in any material respect from the drafts thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has\nassumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and\nconsents required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that\nwould have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger.\nWe are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without\nindependent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to\nlegal, tax or regulatory matters. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any\nother alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or\nare available. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any\nof the Company\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be\nreceived by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in\nthe Merger. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor\nhave we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial,\neconomic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof.\nEvents occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do\nnot assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Merger and\nwill receive a fee for our services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the\ntwo years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financing services to the Company and financial advisory and\nfinancing services for Francisco Partners Management, L.P. (\u201cFrancisco Partners\u201d) (which we understand is the\nultimate controlling equity owner of Parent) and certain of its majority-controlled affiliates (collectively, the\n\u201cFrancisco Partners Related Entities\u201d) and, in each case, have received fees in connection with such services.\nMorgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Company, Parent,\nFrancisco Partners, the Francisco Partners Related Entities and their respective affiliates in the future and would\nexpect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.\nPlease note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment\nmanagement and individual wealth management businesses.
