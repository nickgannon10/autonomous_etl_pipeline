In\naddition, under the Merger Agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of\nthe Merger. A failure to vote your shares, an abstention from voting or a broker non-vote will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special\nMeeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, we do not expect any\nbroker non-votes at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal?\nA:\nApproval of each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of\na majority of the shares present in person (including by means of remote communication) or represented by\nproxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the Special Meeting as of the Record Date.\nThe failure of any common stockholder of record to (i) submit a signed proxy card\u037e (ii) grant a proxy over the\nInternet or by telephone\u037e or (iii) vote via the Virtual Special Meeting Website at the Special Meeting will not\nhave any effect on either the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. If you hold your shares in\n\u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to vote your shares will not\nhave any effect on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. However, abstentions will have\nthe same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat is \u201cMerger-related compensation\u201d?\nA:\n\u201cMerger-related compensation\u201d is certain compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger and\nmay become payable to our named executive officers under our existing plans or agreements, which is the\nsubject of the Compensation Proposal. See \u201cProposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive\nOfficer Compensation\u201d beginning on page 110.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve \u201cMerger-related compensation\u201d payable\nto CAI\u2019s named executive officers under its plans or agreements?\nA:\nIn accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing you with the\nopportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be payable to our named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if the common stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special\nMeeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with\nrespect to the Compensation Proposal is on an advisory basis and will not be binding on CAI or Parent. Further,\nthe underlying compensation plans and agreements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject\nto stockholder approval. Accordingly, payment of the \u201cMerger-related compensation\u201d is not contingent on\ncommon stockholder approval of the Compensation Proposal.\nQ:\nHow many votes am I entitled to cast for each share that I own?\nA:\nEach share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share.\n20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat is a quorum?\nA:\nA quorum is necessary to hold a valid Special Meeting. A quorum will be present if holders of a majority of the\nissued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting on the Record Date are\nrepresented via the Virtual Special Meeting Website or by proxy, regardless of whether the proxy has authority\nto vote on the Merger Proposal. If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, the Special Meeting may be\nadjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.\nIf you submit a proxy but abstain or fail to provide voting instructions on any of the proposals listed on the\nproxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the\nSpecial Meeting.\nIf your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee and you do not tell your\nbroker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to vote your shares, these shares will not be counted for purposes of\ndetermining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote?\nA:\nThe Board unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe Adjournment Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal.\nQ:\nWhy is the Board recommending that I vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal?\nA:\nAfter careful consideration and after consultation with the Company\u2019s legal and financial advisors, the Board\nunanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including\nthe Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders on the terms and\nconditions set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) adopted resolutions approving and declaring the advisability\nof the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, on the terms and\nconditions set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e and (iii) adopted resolutions recommending that the stockholders\nof the Company entitled to vote adopt the Merger Agreement and directing that the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, be submitted to the stockholders of the Company\nentitled to vote for adoption. In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and to unanimously\nrecommend approval of each of the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation\nProposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as the Company\u2019s legal and financial advisors, and\nconsidered the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board also considered each of the items set forth under\n\u201cThe Merger-Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 54.\nQ:\nWhat effects will the Merger have on the Company?\nA:\nOur common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is quoted on the NYSE under the symbol\n\u201cCAI.\u201d In addition, our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock are currently registered under\nthe Exchange Act and quoted on the NYSE under the symbols \u201cCAI-PA\u201d and \u201cCAI-PB,\u201d respectively. As a\nresult of the Merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be wholly-owned by\nParent. Following the consummation of the Merger, the registration of our common stock (and our Preferred\nStock) and our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act will be terminated. In addition, upon the\nconsummation of the Merger, our common stock (and our Preferred Stock) will no longer be listed on any stock\nexchange or quotation system, including the NYSE.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not consummated?\nA:\nIf the Merger Proposal is not approved by the required vote of our common stockholders, or if the Merger is not\nconsummated for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection\nwith the Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public company and shares of our common stock (and\nPreferred Stock) will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and\nwe will continue to file periodic and current reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we\nexpect that management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today\nand that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently\nsubject, including, among other things, the risks described in the risk factors included in our filings with the\nSEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on\nMarch 1, 2021, which is incorporated by reference herein, as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC.\n21\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFurthermore, depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of our\ncommon stock may decline significantly, and if that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our\ncommon stock would return to the price at which it traded as of the date of this proxy statement or reach the\nprice level of the Common Merger Consideration.\nAccordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and\nopportunities on the future value of your shares. If the Merger is not completed, the Board will continue to\nevaluate and review our business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will\nmake such changes, if any, as are deemed appropriate. If the Merger Proposal is not approved by common\nstockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other\ntransaction acceptable to the Board will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will\nnot be adversely impacted.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay to Parent the\nTermination Fee of $35.0 million or Parent may be required to pay us the Parent Termination Fee of $35.0 million.\nFurthermore, upon any termination of the Merger Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee or the\nParent Termination Fee is payable, the paying party will, in addition to payment of the Termination Fee or the\nParent Termination Fee, as applicable, be required to pay the Merger Agreement Expenses in an amount not to\nexceed $5.0 million. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fees and Treatment of Expenses\u201d beginning on\npage 107.\nFinally, if the Merger does not close, we would cause our subsidiaries to engage in a series of transactions such\nthat our position would be as if the Migration had not occurred in all material respects. See \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-The Migration\u201d beginning on page 82.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares?\nA:\nWe urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents referred to, or\nincorporated by reference, in this proxy statement, and to consider how the Merger affects you. Your vote is\nimportant. If you are a common stockholder of record, that is, if your shares are registered in your name with\nComputershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent, there are four ways to vote:\n\u2022\nby signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope\u037e\n\u2022\nby visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the Special Meeting and voting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website (however, simply\nattending the Special Meeting will not cause your shares to be voted).\nA 16-digit control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and to confirm that\nyour voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by\ntelephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically\nover the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which\nyou will be responsible.\nTo vote your shares during the Special Meeting, click on the vote button provided on the screen and follow the\ninstructions provided. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the Special Meeting during the check-in or\nSpecial Meeting time, please call the technical support number that will be posted on the log in page.\nEven if you plan to attend the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website, you are strongly\nencouraged to vote your shares by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a valid proxy to vote shares\nthat you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares at the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting\nWebsite even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote via the\nVirtual Special Meeting Website, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.\nIf your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you may vote through\nyour broker, bank, trustee or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your\nbroker, bank, trustee or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other\nnominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone prior to the\nSpecial Meeting through your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the\n22\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nvoting form provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee. Your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee\ncannot vote on any of the proposals, including the Merger Proposal, without your instructions. If you hold your\nshares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may not vote your shares at the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting\nWebsite unless you obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote?\nA:\nThe vote on the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of outstanding shares of common stock entitled\nto vote at the Special Meeting as of the Record Date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote, it will\nhave the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nThe vote to approve each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal is based on the total\nnumber of outstanding shares of common stock present in person (including by means of remote\ncommunication) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the Special Meeting. If you do\nnot vote, it will have no effect on either the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nA:\nNo. If you hold your shares in certificated form and in your name as a stockholder of record, then shortly after\nthe Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal from the paying agent for the Merger with\ndetailed written instructions for exchanging your shares for the applicable Merger Consideration. If your shares\nare held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your\nbroker, bank, trustee or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your\n\u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Do not send in your certificates, if\nany, now or with your proxy card.\nQ:\nI hold my shares in certificated form but do not know where my stock certificate is-how will I get the applicable\nMerger Consideration for my shares?\nA:\nIf the Merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the Merger will\ninclude the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate, including signing an\naffidavit attesting to the loss of your stock certificate. The paying agent may also require that you provide a\nbond in customary amount or an indemnity agreement in order to cover any potential loss.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares before completion of the Merger?\nA:\nIf you transfer your shares, you will have transferred your right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration\nin the Merger. In order to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares through\ncompletion of the Merger.\nThe Record Date for common stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the\nconsummation of the Merger. If you transfer your shares after the Record Date but before the closing of the\nMerger, you will have transferred your right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in the Merger, but\nretained the right to vote at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the applicable Merger Consideration for my\nshares?\nA:\nDissenting stockholders of record, which includes both holders of shares of common stock and Preferred Stock,\nas applicable, as registered in the records of the Company, who do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal (to\nthe extent they are entitled to vote on the Merger Proposal) and otherwise comply with the requirements of\nSection 262 of the DGCL are entitled to statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the\nMerger. This means that if you comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, you are entitled to\nhave the \u201cfair value\u201d (as defined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as\nAnnex C to this proxy statement) of your shares determined in accordance with Delaware law and to receive\npayment based on that valuation instead of receiving the applicable Merger Consideration. The ultimate amount\nyou would receive in an appraisal proceeding may be more than, the same as or less than the amount you would\nhave received under the Merger Agreement. Failure to strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL may result\nin your waiver of, or inability to exercise, appraisal rights. See \u201cThe Merger-Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning on\npage 73 and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute, Section 262 of the DGCL, which is reproduced\n23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nin its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal (to the extent they are\nentitled to vote on the Merger Proposal), you will waive your appraisal rights, unless you revoke your proxy, if\nrevocable, prior to the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting and otherwise comply with Section 262 of the\nDGCL.\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A.,\nyou are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this proxy\nstatement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.\nIf your shares are held through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial\nowner\u201d of shares held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your\nbroker, bank, trustee or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of\nrecord. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to\nvote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting\nvia the Virtual Special Meeting Website. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not\nvia the Virtual Special Meeting Website. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not\nvote your shares at the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website unless you obtain a valid proxy\nfrom your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently\nscheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other\nnominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee\nto vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the\nsame effect as if you voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on either the Adjournment\nProposal or the Compensation Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, which we refer to as a \u201cproxy holder,\u201d to vote your shares.\nThe written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a\n\u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\nTimothy B. Page, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director, and Steven J.\nGarcia, our Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting, with full power of\nsubstitution.\nQ:\nCan I revoke my proxy?\nA:\nYes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting. If you are a common\nstockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company\u2019s Secretary in writing at Steuart\nTower, 1 Market Plaza, Suite 2400, San Francisco, California 94105, or by submitting a new proxy by telephone,\nthe Internet or mail, in each case, dated after the date of the proxy being revoked. In addition, you may revoke\nyour proxy by attending the Special Meeting and voting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website (however,\nsimply attending the Special Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked). Please note that if you hold your\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you have instructed a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee to vote your shares,\nthe above-described options for revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you must follow\nthe instructions received from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions.\nQ:\nIf a common stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you use to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate.\nWhen completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares\nshould be voted \u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of\nbusiness to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a\nmatter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e (2)\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal.\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nHow are votes counted?\nA:\nFor the Merger Proposal, you may vote \u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN.\u201d Abstentions and broker non-\nvotes, if any, will have the same effect as votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d this proposal.\nFor the Adjournment Proposal, you may vote \u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN.\u201d Abstentions will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d this proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on this proposal.\nFor the Compensation Proposal, you may vote \u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN.\u201d Abstentions will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d this proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on this proposal.\nBecause none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may\nhave discretionary authority to vote, we do not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nPlease sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy\ncard and voting instruction card that you receive.\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and\nmultiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one\nbrokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you\nhold shares. If you are a common stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name,\nyou will receive more than one proxy card.\nQ:\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nA:\nWe have engaged Georgeson LLC (\u201cGeorgeson\u201d) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting.\nWe estimate that we will pay Georgeson a fee of approximately $20,000 and will reimburse Georgeson for\nreasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify it and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses,\ndamages and expenses. We may also reimburse brokers, banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries\nrepresenting beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners\nand in obtaining voting instructions from those owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit\nproxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person. They will not be paid any additional\namounts for soliciting proxies.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nWe intend to publish the final voting results of the Special Meeting in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed\nwith the SEC within four business days after the Special Meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are\npublicly available when filed. See \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d beginning on page 117.\nQ:\nWill I have to pay taxes on the applicable Merger Consideration I receive?\nA:\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for shares pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. You are urged to read \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 78 for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the Merger. Because individual circumstances may differ, you are urged to consult your own\ntax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the exchange of shares for cash pursuant to the\nMerger, in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or\nforeign income and other tax laws).\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more\nstockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received and only if the applicable stockholder\nprovides advance notice and follows certain procedures.\nIn such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain\nbrokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through\nbrokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\na householding notification from your broker.

Assuming timely\nsatisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by our common stockholders of the Merger\nProposal and completion of the Migration, we currently expect to complete the Merger in the late third quarter or\nearly fourth quarter of 2021. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because\nthe Merger is subject to the closing conditions, including completion of the Migration, each as described in\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Contribution, Migration Filings and Merger\u201d beginning on page 102,\nmany of which are outside of our control.\nQ:\nIf the Merger is completed, how will I receive the cash for my shares?\nA:\nIf the Merger is completed and you are not exercising appraisal rights and your shares are held in book-entry,\nthe paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares without any further action\non your part.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Board and the senior management team of the Company regularly review the Company\u2019s performance, future\ngrowth prospects, business composition, use of capital and overall strategic direction, with the objective of\nmaximizing long-term stockholder value. At various times, these reviews have included consideration of a variety of\nstrategic alternatives as an independent company, including potential changes to the Company\u2019s operating\nsegments, as well as potential transactions with third parties. As part of the Board review process, independent\ndirectors have regularly engaged with the Company\u2019s stockholders, soliciting their input on key matters, including\ncorporate governance, the strategic direction of the Company, and other important stockholder interests.\nIn connection with the Board\u2019s reviews and stockholder interactions, the Board and senior management have taken a\nnumber of actions to enhance stockholder value. Such actions have included investment in the Company\u2019s earning\nassets when market conditions were deemed favorable, while deferring investment when market conditions were\ndeemed more challenged, continued review of the Company\u2019s capital structure and prevailing interest rates to\nopportunistically raise capital, and consistent evaluation of the Company\u2019s capital return policy. Since 2020, the\nCompany has effectively streamlined the business, returning to a pure-play container lessor following the disposition\nof the Company\u2019s logistics and rail businesses in 2020. Since 2018, the Company has repurchased approximately 14%\nof its outstanding shares of common stock and, in June 2020, enhanced its capital return program with the initiation\nof a regular cash dividend on the Company\u2019s common stock at a rate of $1.00 per share annually, which has since\nbeen increased 20% to $1.20 per share annually, effective the first quarter of 2021.\nBetween June 2019 and December 2019, representatives of the Company received various communications from, and\nheld a number of in person, video and telephonic meetings with, representatives of certain of the Company\u2019s then-\nlargest stockholders to discuss stockholder concerns and opinions. In these communications and calls, among other\nthings, representatives of such stockholders: (i) expressed concern regarding the Company\u2019s depressed stock price\nto book value ratio, at one point noting that, in one such stockholder\u2019s calculation, the Company\u2019s common stock\nwas trading at a 30% discount to book value, (ii) expressed concern regarding the strategic direction of the Company\nand other operational matters, including repeated desire for the Company to sell its rail and logistics businesses, (iii)\nrepeatedly encouraged the Board to engage a financial advisor to review all strategic alternatives, including, but not\nlimited to, a sale of the Company via an auction process and repurchasing shares on a larger scale, (iv) communicated\nthat the Company\u2019s share price did not reflect the intrinsic value of the Company, and (v) stated that, unless the\nCompany retained an investment bank to assist with a strategic alternatives review process to maximize stockholder\nvalue, certain of such stockholders would consider all available options, including making their concerns public,\nnominating their own slate of directors for stockholder consideration at the next election of directors, and engaging a\nproxy solicitor and a law firm to represent such stockholder in a potential proxy contest. During this time, the\nCompany\u2019s representatives emphasized to representatives of such stockholders that the Board was committed to\nfulfilling its fiduciary duty of acting in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nAs part of its regular consideration of potential opportunities to strengthen the Company\u2019s business and maximize\nlong-term stockholder value, and taking into account communications from stockholders during this timeframe, the\nBoard held various meetings at which the Board, among other things: (i) considered and reviewed the viewpoints of\nsuch stockholders in deciding whether to initiate a strategic alternatives process, including the timing of any public\nannouncement thereof, (ii) discussed the repeated pressure such stockholders were putting on the\n39TABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany to engage a financial advisor, (iii) received presentations from representatives of Perkins Coie LLP, the\nCompany\u2019s primary outside legal counsel (\u201cPerkins Coie\u201d), and Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP, the Company\u2019s\noutside Delaware legal counsel (\u201cPotter Anderson\u201d), regarding, among other things, the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in a\nstrategic alternative review process, (iv) authorized each of David Remington, the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board,\nand Victor Garcia, the Company\u2019s then-current President, Chief Executive Officer and director, to interview various\ninvestment banks to potentially serve as the Company\u2019s financial advisor to advise the Company in connection with\n(a) activist and other stockholder proposals, both formal and informal, and (b) analyze and consider various strategic\nand financial alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company and the optimal timing and availability of any\nother alternatives to maximize stockholder value for the Company, and (v) engaged a public relations firm to assist in\nstockholder outreach.\nBetween June 15, 2019 and September 11, 2019, the Company\u2019s representatives contacted and interviewed four\ninvestment banks, including Centerview, regarding an engagement as the Company\u2019s financial advisor. During\nvarious meetings with such investment banks, representatives of such investment banks discussed their respective\nqualifications as well as proposed approaches for the Company to maximize stockholder value. The Company\u2019s\nrepresentatives asked questions and received answers from such investment banks.\nOn June 20, 2019, as part of the Board\u2019s commitment to stockholder responsiveness and maximizing stockholder\nvalue, the Company sold $15.8 million of rail cars from its railcar leasing portfolio to The InStar Group (\u201cInStar\u201d). The\nCompany had also previously sold $39.6 million of railcars from its railcar leasing portfolio to Exxon Mobil\nCorporation on November 30, 2018, and $165.3 million of railcars from its railcar leasing portfolio to InStar on February\n26, 2019.\nOn August 7, 2019, the Company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of\n2019 and announcing its intention to sell its remaining rail fleet.

The rest of the Board informally approved and agreed with the\nengagement, with the formal approval occurring at a meeting of the Board on September 11, 2019, and the Company\nentering into an engagement letter with Centerview to serve as the Company\u2019s financial advisor on September 13,\n2019.\nOn September 7, 2019, the Board held a meeting by teleconference, which was also attended by representatives of\nCompany management, representatives of Centerview, a representative of Perkins Coie, and representatives of Joele\nFrank Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher, the Company\u2019s public relations firm (\u201cJoele Frank\u201d). The purpose of the meeting\nwas to, among other things, have a representative of Perkins Coie refresh the Board on prior discussions with Potter\nAnderson and with Perkins Coie regarding the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties, discuss whether to make a public\nannouncement regarding the strategic alternatives process, and discuss recent calls among Mr. Remington, Mr.\nGarcia and certain of the Company\u2019s then-largest stockholders. In addition, the Board discussed unsolicited inbound\ninterest in acquiring the Company in the form of a telephone call to Mr. Garcia from the chief executive officer of a\npotential strategic buyer (\u201cParty A\u201d).\nOn September 11, 2019, the Board approved the engagement of Centerview as the Company\u2019s financial advisor. The\nBoard had considered many factors in selecting a financial advisor, including relationships with other potential\nstrategic or financial buyers, relevant experience and reputation. In addition, the Board discussed all the financial\nadvisor candidates and Mr. Remington\u2019s reasons for recommending Centerview.\nAlso, on September 11, 2019, Mr. Garcia responded to an unsolicited email from Mr. Kenji Yasuno, the Senior\nManaging Executive Officer of what was then Mitsubishi UFJ Lease and Finance Company Limited (the former name\nof Parent), which owned MUL Railcars, Inc. (\u201cMUL Railcar\u201d), a competitor of the Company\u2019s rail business, and\nBeacon Intermodal Leasing, LLC (\u201cBeacon\u201d), a competitor of the Company\u2019s container business, in which Mr. Yasuno\nrequested a meeting to learn more about the Company. Later that day, Mr. Garcia accepted Mr. Yasuno\u2019s\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrequest for a meeting and a meeting among Messrs. Garcia, Timothy Page, the Company\u2019s then-current Chief\nFinancial Officer and current President, Chief Executive Officer and director, Yasuno, and Toshio Oka, Executive\nOfficer and General Manager of Parent, was subsequently scheduled for October 9, 2019.\nOn September 13, 2019, the chief executive officer of Party A contacted Mr. Garcia stating that he wanted to discuss\ncombining the Company and Party A, and wanted to share his thoughts on benefits, potential structure and value. A\nmeeting was scheduled for October 1, 2019, and then rescheduled for November 13, 2019, with Mr. Remington and\nAndrew Ogawa, a member of the Board.\nOn September 15, 2019, the chief executive officer of Party A accepted Mr. Garcia\u2019s invitation for a meeting and said\nthat he would be joined by Party A\u2019s lead independent director.\nOn September 17, 2019, the Board held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by Company management, and\na representative of Perkins Coie, Centerview and Joele Frank.

Mr. Garcia was excluded from these meetings due to the conflicts of interest raised by the\nMBO Activities. During such meetings, among other things, the Non-Employee Directors discussed the advantages\nand disadvantages of public announcement of the retention of Centerview as a strategic advisor, and/or the\nexploration of strategic alternatives, as well as the aforementioned communications from activist stockholders.\nOn September 28, 2019, Mr. Garcia sent an email to Mr. Yasuno, inviting Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka to dinner after their\nscheduled meeting on October 9, 2019, which was accepted by Mr. Yasuno on September 29, 2019.\nOn September 30, 2019, the Non-Executive Directors met with Mr. Garcia to discuss the MBO Activities.\nOn October 9, 2019, the Non-Executive Directors held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a\nrepresentative of Perkins Coie. At this meeting, the Non-Executive Directors decided that it was in the best interest of\nthe Company and its stockholders to form a special committee of the Board to insulate the strategic alternatives\nprocess from any participation by Mr. Garcia. All members of the Board (other than Mr. Garcia) were appointed to the\nspecial committee (the \u201cSpecial Committee\u201d).\nSubsequently, on October 9, 2019, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Page met and subsequently had dinner with Mr. Yasuno and\nMr. Oka of Parent, at which meeting Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka expressed interest in a potential acquisition of the\nCompany.\nLater, on October 10, 2019, Mr. Garcia emailed Mr. Remington that he and Mr. Page had a meeting, followed by dinner,\nwith Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka. Mr. Garcia noted that this would be a normal visit to catch up, since Mr. Yasuno and\nMr. Oka were going to be in San Francisco, California in connection with visiting a San Francisco-based aircraft\nlessor that Parent owned. Mr. Garcia said that Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka expressed interest in the Company\u2019s rail\nbusiness and mentioned that Parent might be interested in combining the Company and Beacon. Mr. Garcia also\nreported that he thanked Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka for their interest and duly noted their comment.\nOn October 11, 2019, Mr. Garcia advised Mr. Remington via email that he had received a call from another potential\nstrategic buyer (\u201cParty B\u201d).\nOn October 14, 2019, the Non-Executive Directors met with Mr. Garcia to deliver a written \u201cwalling off\u201d protocol to\nseparate Mr. Garcia from all matters relating to the strategic alternatives process due to the MBO Activities.\nAlso, on October 29, 2019, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the third quarter of\n2019.

At the close of business on October 30, 2019, the Company\u2019s common stock closed\ntrading at $23.77 per share on the NYSE.\nOn November 1, 2019, Mr. Oka emailed Mr. Garcia and said that he and Mr. Yasuno planned to visit San Francisco,\nCalifornia on November 21, 2019 and would like to arrange another in-person meeting to discuss a potential\nacquisition of the Company, including the rail business. Mr. Garcia responded and accepted the invitation and noted\nthat Mr. Page would also attend the meeting.\nOn November 3, 2019, Mr. Garcia sent an email to Mr. Remington advising him of the planned meeting with the\nrepresentatives of Parent on November 21, 2019 and invited Mr. Remington and other members of the Board to\nparticipate in the meeting. It was subsequently decided that Mr. Remington and Mr. Williford would meet\nrepresentatives of Parent on November 21, 2019 to discuss Parent\u2019s interest in acquiring the Company without Mr.\nGarcia and Mr. Page, and that Mr. Garcia and Mr. Page would meet with representatives of Parent to discuss a sale of\nthe rail business in a separate meeting.\nBetween November 5, 2019 and February 26, 2020, the Company negotiated and entered into non-disclosure\nagreements with potential bidders, including Party A, Party B, Party C (as defined below), Party D (as defined below)\nand Parent.\nOn November 13, 2019, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa met with Party A\u2019s chief executive officer and a member of\nParty A\u2019s board of directors at Perkins Coie\u2019s San Francisco, California offices. At the meeting, Party A made a non-\nbinding offer to purchase the Company in the form of 50% cash and 50% Party A stock, with an aggregate value of\n80% of the value of one share of Party A common stock for each share of the Company\u2019s common stock. The\naggregate offer represented an approximate value of $27.50 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock.

Centerview presented an analysis of the\nCompany\u2019s strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the Company.

The Special\nCommittee concluded that both non-binding offers were inadequate. The Company\u2019s common stock closed trading at\n$23.19 per share on the NYSE on November 14, 2019. The meeting of the Special Committee was adjourned until the\nnext day.\nOn November 15, 2019, the Special Committee continued the meeting that began November 14, 2019, and Centerview\npresented alternative ways for the Company to proceed with respect to the strategic alternatives process, including\nexpanding outreach beyond the parties that had made incoming inquiries. The Special Committee discussed, among\nother things, whether it should instruct Centerview to widen its search and the potential responses to the non-\nbinding offers from each of Party A and Party B. The Special Committee requested that Centerview prepare and\nprovide to Mr. Remington, based on Centerview\u2019s familiarity with the industry, a list of potential buyers with the\ncapacity to engage in a purchase of the Company to supplement the inbound interest. The Company\u2019s common stock\nclosed trading at $23.28 per share on the NYSE.\nOn November 17, 2019, the Board adopted a resolution via unanimous written consent that, in light of the formation\nof the Special Committee and its role in overseeing the Company\u2019s review of strategic alternatives, Centerview would\nreport to, and only take instructions from, the Special Committee (as opposed to the Board, which included Mr.\nGarcia).\nOn November 21, 2019, Mr. Remington and Mr. Williford met Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka of Parent at Perkins Coie\u2019s\noffices in San Francisco, California.

Mr. Remington and\nMr. Ogawa also advised Party A that the Company had received multiple other unsolicited inbound offers. The\nCompany\u2019s common stock closed trading at $24.05 per share on the NYSE.\nOn December 9, 2019, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a representative\nof Perkins Coie.

At the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Party B indicated, among other things, that they were interested in making an all-cash offer, would\nlike to acquire the Company as a platform and keep management in place and had engaged a financial advisor.\nHowever, the representatives of Party B did not make an offer and no potential purchase price was mentioned.\nOn December 20, 2019, Mr. Ogawa met with representatives of Parent in Tokyo, Japan. At the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Parent indicated, among other things, that they were interested in making an all-cash offer, that\nthey believed the Company would be a great fit as part of Parent\u2019s overall business and that they had engaged a\nfinancial advisor.\nOn December 27, 2019, Mr. Yasuno emailed Mr. Remington to advise him that Parent would be unable to meet the\ntimeline for presenting an offer to the Company that it had earlier communicated and requested a meeting with Mr.\nRemington in San Francisco, California in early January 2020, which was subsequently scheduled for January 10,\n2020. Mr. Yasuno did not explain the reason for the delay.\nOn December 28, 2019, Mr. Remington sent an update regarding the strategic alternatives process to the Special\nCommittee in which he noted that as of such date the Company had 11 active inbound parties, including Party A,\nParty B, Party C and Parent, and that the Company was in the process of negotiating non-disclosure agreements with\neight of those 11 parties.

In the meeting, Mr. Yasuno explained that at that time Parent could not participate in a strategic process, but\ncould not go into more detail or disclose for how long Parent would be restricted from participating in such a process.\nHowever, Mr. Yasuno communicated to Mr. Remington, Mr. Williford and Mr. Ogawa that Parent remained highly\ninterested in purchasing the Company.\nOn January 13, 2020, at the direction of the Special Committee, Centerview began reaching out to potential buyers of\nthe Company and, in connection therewith, Centerview also distributed process letters to such buyers inviting them\nto submit non-binding proposals for a potential acquisition of the Company. Centerview communicated to potential\nbuyers that non-binding indications of interest would be due on February 12, 2020.\nFrom January 14, 2020 through March 10, 2020, Centerview held discussions with 39 Special Committee-approved\nparties about their respective interest in pursuing a potential transaction with the Company. Most of these parties\ncommunicated a lack of interest or ability to participate in a potential transaction for reasons such as the pandemic-\ndepressed market. Of the parties contacted, 19 indicated an interest in receiving additional information on the\nCompany\u2019s operations as a basis for evaluation and subject to executing confidentiality agreements, were provided\nsuch information related to the Company through meetings with representatives of Company or the Company\u2019s\nvirtual data room, as well as draft merger agreements. Thereafter, following the negotiation and execution of non-\ndisclosure agreements with 20 parties, 17 parties participated in discussions with the Company\u2019s management as well\nas certain members of the Special Committee to further evaluate a potential transaction and 4 parties submitted\npreliminary indications of interest.\nOn January 15, 2020, Mr. Yasuno emailed Mr. Remington to, among other things, recommunicate Parent\u2019s interest in\nmaking an offer for the Company, but noted that Parent would still be unable to do so on the requested timeline. Mr.\nYasuno indicated that he would consult with Parent\u2019s advisors and discuss internally about the idea of sharing\ninformation only between legal advisors at this point and whether Parent could engage in a due diligence process\nbased on the executed non-disclosure agreement in order to request non-public information, so that Parent could be\nprepared to move ahead quickly with a compelling offer when the time came.\nFrom January 24, 2020 through March 2, 2020, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Page as well as certain members of the Special\nCommittee participated in management meetings with representatives of the 17 interested parties, including\nrepresentatives of Party A, Party B, Party C, a potential financial sponsor buyer (\u201cParty D\u201d) and Parent.\nOn February 10, 2020, Mr. Yasuno replied to a February 8, 2020 email from Mr. Remington asking if there had been a\nchange in status and stated that Parent had received the process letter from Centerview and Parent would still be\nunable to submit a proposal on the requested timeline, but that Parent remained enthusiastic about the potential\ntransaction and hoped to be able to submit a proposal once its previously noted, but not described, issue was\nresolved. Mr. Yasuno also requested to stay in touch with Mr. Remington and to hold a meeting in mid-March 2020 to\ndiscuss a potential offer should the opportunity still exist.\nOn February 12, 2020, Parent delivered a letter in response to the process letter in which it stated that it remained\ninterested, but that it could not engage until the summer of 2020.\nIn February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began its impact on global markets and commerce, including the\nCompany\u2019s operations. The spread of COVID-19 throughout the world and the strong actions taken by many\ncountries to reduce exposures led to a sharp decrease in global economic activity during the beginning of the second\nquarter of 2020, which, at the time, the Company expected to continue during 2020. While the COVID-19 pandemic\nand the related global economic effects had not materially impacted the Company\u2019s business, operations, or financial\nresults to date, the Company expected at the time that, among other things, the global economic impact would result\nin a decline in overall incremental demand for the Company\u2019s services over the remainder of the year and would\nelevate the risk of delayed payment or default by the Company\u2019s customers. Along those lines, the Company\nmodeled a number of downside stress scenarios and their impact on liquidity. Furthermore, worldwide financial\nmarkets experienced periods of extraordinary disruption and volatility, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19\npandemic and ultimately impacted the number of active bidders. At such time, the Company publicly disclosed that\nthe extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak would impact the Company\u2019s business and operations would depend on\nfuture developments that were highly uncertain and could not be predicted.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFrom March 2020 through mid-June 2020, the Special Committee and the Board each met numerous times to discuss,\namong other things, the Company\u2019s financial position due to the COVID-19 pandemic, whether the strategic\nalternatives process should be paused due to COVID-19, extending the bid period and the consequences of making a\npotential executive leadership change at this stage of the strategic alternatives process.\nOn March 1, 2020, Mr. Yasuno emailed representatives of Centerview to follow up on the letter Parent submitted on\nFebruary 12, 2020 in response to the process letter in order to reaffirm that Parent continued to be enthusiastic about\na potential transaction and that Parent would contact Centerview again in mid-March 2020.\nOn March 5, 2020, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa had a telephonic meeting with representatives of Party B, who\nstated that it was withdrawing from the process due to the time it was taking Party B to integrate a previous\nacquisition.

At\nthis time, he summarized the non-binding offers as (i) Party A: 0.80 shares of Party A stock for each share of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock, which was equivalent to a price of approximately $21.86 per share of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock\u037e (ii) Party C: $24 to $27 per share, in cash\u037e (iii) another potential financial sponsor buyer: $23 to $26 per\nshare, in cash\u037e (iv) another potential financial sponsor buyer: $23.25 per share, in cash, for just the Company\u2019s\ncontainer business, but not the logistics or rail business\u037e (v) a potential strategic buyer declined to make an offer\ngiven market conditions and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic\u037e and (vi) Party D\ndeclined to make an offer at this time based on their view of market conditions and uncertainty over global pandemic\ndriven economic growth, but indicated potential interest when the market stabilized in the future and acknowledged a\npotential value of the Company in the $30 per share range. In addition, the Special Committee discussed the\nCompany\u2019s valuation and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on global markets, including on the market price per\nshare of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company\u2019s common stock closed trading at $15.24 per share on the\nNYSE.\nOn March 16, 2020, the Special Committee and a representative of Perkins Coie held a telephonic meeting.

Party A\u2019s chief\nexecutive officer cited the strategic benefits that Party A saw in combing the two companies, and then discussed\nParty A\u2019s concerns with both the Company\u2019s rail and logistics business, to which he attributed only a small positive\nvalue. The representatives of Party A then noted that Party A was considering changing its offer from a combination\nof cash and stock to only stock due to the then-current market volatility.\nAlso, on March 26, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a\nrepresentative of Perkins Coie, to discuss, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s business\nand discussions with the Company\u2019s lenders related thereto, concerns the Special Committee had with the current\nleadership structure of the Company and the possible effects of changing leadership in the middle of the strategic\nalternatives process. With respect to the impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s business and discussions with the\nCompany\u2019s lenders related thereto, Mr. Page described his discussions with the Company\u2019s lenders, who reaffirmed\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntheir support of the Company and the shipping industry in general, who also noted that the shipping industry (which\nincludes container leasing companies) was very important to the world economy. With respect to a potential\nleadership change, the Special Committee concluded that any change to leadership should occur only after the\nstrategic alternatives process was terminated. In addition, the Special Committee discussed whether to continue the\nstrategic alternatives process and the potential for stockholder activist actions if the strategic alternatives process\nwas terminated given the uncertainty created by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Remington also described\nCenterview\u2019s recommendation to continue the process with parties that had the wherewithal to consummate a\npotential transaction in light of the then-current macroeconomic backdrop given the uncertainty of COVID-19\u2019s\npotential impact on the Company\u2019s financial performance and liquidity. After discussion, the Special Committee\ndecided to continue the strategic alternatives process. The Special Committee further discussed the various bids\nreceived to date and the Special Committee discussed how it could most effectively negotiate with third-party\nbidders.\nOn March 30, 2020, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa had a telephonic meeting with representatives of Party D,\nrepresentatives of Party D\u2019s financial advisor and representatives of Centerview to discuss the market volatility being\ndriven by COVID-19. The representatives of Party D presented their thinking about the then-current market\nconditions, along with what they saw as a continued deterioration in multiple indicators, including that one-third of\nthe world was in quarantine, and speculated that container demand would be a lagging indicator. The representatives\nof Party D also noted that they were concerned that container shipping lines would also come under stress and pass\non that stress to container leasing companies.\nDuring April 2020 and May 2020, representatives of Party A, Party C and Party D conducted due diligence on the\nCompany and the Company conducted reverse due diligence on Party A.\nOn April 14, 2020, representatives of Centerview provided the Special Committee with a relationship disclosure\nmemorandum.\nOn May 5, 2020, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the first quarter of 2020. The\nCompany\u2019s common stock closed trading at $15.48 per share on the NYSE.\nOn May 20, 2020, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by Mr. Page and a\nrepresentative of Perkins Coie. The initial portion of the Board meeting pertained to operational issues, including\napproval of new pricing guidelines for leases. After the operational discussion, Mr. Garcia left the meeting. Mr.\nRemington then provided the remaining Board members (i.e., the members of the Special Committee) and Mr. Page\nwith an update regarding the strategic alternatives process. Mr. Remington informed the remaining members of the\nBoard that Party D had decided not to move forward with an offer because of a number of factors, including: (i)\nconcern about a weak market for container leasing in 2020\u037e (ii) concern about a \u201cchange of control\u201d default under\ncertain of the Company\u2019s then-outstanding financing documents\u037e and (iii) a belief that the Board would require a\nprice that approximated book value, and that book value was too great a premium over the then-current market price.\nMr. Remington then told the remaining Board members that he had advised Centerview that it should contact Party A\nand advise Party A that it would need to increase its preliminary offer if it expected to have its impending offer\naccepted by the Board.\nOn June 1, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of\nParty C, and representatives of Centerview and Perkins Coie, during which representatives from Party C presented on\nthe background of the potential offer they would be submitting to the Special Committee. The Company\u2019s common\nstock closed trading at $18.58 per share on the NYSE.\nOn June 2, 2020, Party C submitted a non-binding offer to purchase the Company at $24 per share, in cash. The\nCompany\u2019s common stock closed trading at $19.44 per share on the NYSE. Party C had communicated that its\nproposal included negative value being ascribed to both rail and logistics. Therefore, Party C was asked to provide a\ncontainer only proposal. Subsequently, representatives of Centerview held calls with representatives of Party C.\nDuring these conversations, Party C verbally revised its non-binding offer to $27 per share, in cash, excluding the rail\nand logistics businesses.\nOn June 2, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s management and representatives of Centerview and Perkins Coie, during which the Special Committee\ndiscussed Party C\u2019s revised offer and the impact of disposing of the rail and logistics businesses separately on\noverall bid prices for the Company.\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 5, 2020, Party A submitted a revised written offer to purchase the Company via a stock for stock acquisition\nwith an exchange ratio of 0.76 of Party A\u2019s shares for each share of the Company\u2019s common stock consisting of 10%\ncash and 90% stock and no stock buyback, which was equivalent to a price of approximately $24.53 per share of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock. Party A indicated that the decrease to the valuation was a result of the significant tax\nrestructuring costs and a lower valuation of the rail and logistics businesses. The Company\u2019s common stock closed\ntrading at $21.87 per share on the NYSE. Following the submission of Party A\u2019s revised written offer, representatives\nof Centerview held calls with representatives of Party A. During these conversations, it was verbally communicated\nthat Party A would increase its bid to an exchange ratio of 0.80, with 10% cash and 90% stock and no stock buyback\nto make its proposal more competitive, subject to the completion of due diligence and further analysis of certain\nissues.\nOn June 6, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a representative of\nPerkins Coie. The Special Committee discussed Party A\u2019s comments to the auction merger agreement and Party A\u2019s\noffer that was submitted on June 5, 2020, and other issues in connection with the strategic alternatives process,\nincluding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the strategic alternatives process.\nOn June 7, 2020, Party A submitted a revised written offer to purchase the Company at an exchange ratio of 0.80 with\n10% cash and 90% stock and no buy back, which was equivalent to a price of approximately $25.82 per share of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock. Party A also clarified how it was valuing the rail and logistics businesses. Party A\nindicated that it was valuing the two businesses at approximately a $25 million discount (i) to current book value, with\nrespect to the rail business, and (ii) based on total book value (less any related shutdown or sale costs, and not\nincluding any goodwill and intangible assets related to logistics acquisitions), with respect to the logistics business.\nOn June 5, 2020, the last business day prior to June 7, 2020, the Company\u2019s common stock closed trading at $21.87\nper share on the NYSE.\nOn June 8, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of\nCenterview and Perkins Coie, during which the Special Committee discussed Party A\u2019s updated offer. In addition, the\nSpecial Committee discussed the other bids independently and in relation to Party A\u2019s offer.\nOn June 10, 2020, Party C revised its bid in writing in the form of a price bridge, dependent on the amount of losses it\nwould incur in disposing of the rail and logistics businesses, with a range of $24.50 per share to $28.00 per share, in\ncash, or $27.20 per share, in cash, if the transaction involved the sale of rail business and the shutdown of the\nlogistics business. The Company\u2019s common stock closed trading at $16.38 per share on the NYSE.\nAlso, on June 10, 2020, representatives of Centerview had a telephone call with Party A\u2019s financial advisor, who\nverbally provided a further updated final bid, wherein the exchange ratio had been increased to 0.85. The updated bid\nwas the same as the previous bid in all other respects.\nOn June 11, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of\nCompany management and representatives of Potter Anderson and Perkins Coie, during which the Special Committee\ndiscussed, among other things, the revised bids from Party A and Party C. Potter Anderson provided the Special\nCommittee a review of the Special Committee\u2019s fiduciary duties in reviewing the bids and reaching a decision. The\nSpecial Committee also discussed whether long-term value was being reduced by the depressed nature of the near-\nterm valuation. Ultimately, the Special Committee decided to reject both bids and to terminate the strategic\nalternatives process because the Special Committee deemed the bids inadequate from a financial point of view. The\nSpecial Committee believed it was unrealistic to think that any bidder would offer fair value in a pandemic-depressed\nmarket, especially considering two of the bidders cited the pandemic-depressed market as their reason for not\nbidding.\nOn June 12, 2020, the Board held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Company\nmanagement (excluding Mr. Garcia) and a representative of Perkins Coie. The Board ratified the Special Committee\u2019s\ndecision to reject bids and to terminate both the strategic alternatives process and Centerview\u2019s engagement.

The Company noted in the press release that, as a result of the strategic alternatives\nprocess, the Company and the Board believed that the Company could best maximize stockholder value by focusing\non its profitable core container business and that current market conditions were not conducive to a transaction\nbeneficial to stockholders. The press release also noted that the Company and the Board were committed to exiting\nthe rail and logistics businesses. The Company\u2019s common stock closed trading at $18.34 per share on the NYSE.\nPrior to the termination of the strategic alternatives process, interest was solicited from 39 potential bidders, which\nincluded 31 financial sponsors and 8 strategic buyers. Of these, there were management meetings with 17 interested\nparties, with about half of each type of group receiving a management presentation. In addition, there were four\nindications of interest received as first round bids. However, two potential bidders withdrew their indications of\ninterest and cited their view of COVID-19-driven unstable market conditions.\nOn June 16, 2020, Mr. Yasuno emailed Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa, in which he stated that Parent would like to\nkeep an open channel of communication with the Company with respect to a potential acquisition of the Company in\nthe future.\nBetween July 1, 2020 and October 7, 2020, Mr. Page, Mr. Remington, Mr. Ogawa had various telephonic meetings with\nrepresentatives of Parent, including Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka, to discuss, among other things, the Board\u2019s willingness\nto listen to incoming inquiries, the lessons the Company learned from the strategic process that had just been\ncompleted, preferred timing for any potential offer to purchase the Company such that the Board could attempt to\nensure that stockholders of the Company would receive maximum value. With respect to the timing for any potential\noffer, Mr. Remington suggested during such calls that a more beneficial time for the Company to entertain an offer,\nand for Parent to be presenting one, would be towards the end of 2021 after the Company had disposed of rail, had\ncontinued to demonstrate good financial performance, and when the market for transportation stocks would in theory\nno longer be depressed.\nOn August 6, 2020, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the second quarter of 2020\nand that the Board had declared the Company\u2019s first quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share.

During the call, the representatives of Parent congratulated\nMr. Page, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa on the sale of the rail business, but mentioned that Parent was still not in a\nposition to engage in discussions regarding a potential transaction until March or April 2021.\nOn December 10, 2020, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by representatives of\nCompany management and Perkins Coie, during which the Board discussed, among other things, the recent\nunsolicited strategic inquiries that it had received from Party A and Party E. The Board decided to explore the\ninquiries, but to refrain from discussions until after February 2021, when the Company\u2019s fourth quarter of 2020 and\nfull year 2020 earnings had been released, in part because the Board expected the results to be favorable to the\nCompany. The Board believe that during that time it could coordinate with Centerview regarding populating a data\nroom with due diligence materials. The Board also believed that delaying its response to Party A and Party E might\nalso benefit stockholders by giving Parent an opportunity to participate in the process.\nOn December 11, 2020, Mr. Remington, Mr. Ogawa, Mr. Page, and representatives of Centerview and Perkins Coie held\na videoconference to obtain Centerview\u2019s advice regarding the questions raised in the Board meeting the prior day\npertaining to how to best respond to incoming strategic inquiries.

The Company\u2019s common stock closed trading at $37.95 per share on the\nNYSE.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 17, 2021, the Board authorized a limited re-opening of the strategic alternatives process. In determining\nwhether to re-engage in a strategic alternatives process, several Board members expressed a belief that the process\nshould be efficient. They were concerned that a repeat of the long process from 2020 would damage the Company by\nboth hurting employee morale and giving the Company the stigma of being \u201cin play.\u201d To mitigate the aforementioned\npotential risks, the Board designed a one-month process, whereby bidders would be required to engage in an intense\ndiscovery period, provide detailed comments on the Merger Agreement and make a \u201clast and final\u201d bid. The Board\nalso authorized the re-engagement of Centerview, pursuant to an engagement letter that was subsequently executed\non March 1, 2021. In addition, the Board approved a response to each of Party A, Party E and Parent, and also an\noutreach to five additional potentially interested parties recommended by Centerview and agreed to by the Board.\nAccordingly, the number of additional parties contacted was limited to those who would be most likely to participate\nand had the ability to do so based on the strategic alternatives process completed in June 2020. Furthermore, given\nthat the Company had just concluded a very fulsome process with public disclosure less than 12 months prior, the\nBoard was of the view that it had sufficient information with which to make such a selection. The Company\u2019s common\nstock closed trading at $41.47 per share on the NYSE.\nOn February 22, 2021, by an action of unanimous written consent of the Board, the Board determined that Centerview\nshould be retained as the Company\u2019s financial advisor with respect to the re-opening of the strategic alternatives\nprocess.\nOn February 24, 2021, the Board held an update call via videoconference, which was also attended by representatives\nof Centerview and Perkins Coie. The purpose of the call was for representatives of Centerview to brief the Board on\nincoming inquiries from prospective bidders, as well as Centerview\u2019s thoughts on running a targeted process that\nwould determine if the much improved economy and the Company\u2019s self-help program, which generally consisted of\nselling the rail and logistics business, implementing a regular dividend and resuming stock buybacks, would lead to a\nbetter valuation from prospective bidders and more attractive bids that would be in the best interest of the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders to accept.\nFrom February 25, 2021 through April 30, 2021, Centerview held discussions with the parties approved by the Board\nat the February 17, 2021 meeting. Most of the parties concluded that they were not interested in evaluating a\npotential transaction given the then current valuation of the public company lessors. During this time,\nrepresentatives of the Company\u2019s management held calls with representatives of Parent, Party A and Party E\nregarding due diligence matters, which were also attended by representatives of Perkins Coie and Centerview, and\nrepresentatives of such parties\u2019 respective financial and legal advisors. Party A, Party E, and Parent continued to\nexpress an interest in evaluating a potential transaction, ultimately providing indications of interest on April 30, 2021.\nOn March 1, 2021, pursuant to the resolutions adopted on February 17, 2021, the Company entered into a new\nengagement letter with Centerview, dated as of February 20, 2021, in order to re-engage Centerview as the Company\u2019s\nfinancial advisor.\nOn March 2, 2021, Mr. Remington and Mr. Page had a videoconference with Party E\u2019s chief executive officer to inform\nParty E that the Company had decided to initiate a new strategic alternatives process. A short discussion ensued\nabout aspects of the process.\nAlso, on March 2, 2021, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by representatives\nof Centerview and representatives of Perkins Coie. Among other topics, representatives of Centerview advised the\nBoard on: (i) a conversation between representatives of Centerview and Party A\u2019s financial advisor, at which a\nrepresentative of Party A\u2019s financial advisor conveyed Party A\u2019s continued strong interest in purchasing the\nCompany\u037e (ii) a summary of \u201cpros and cons\u201d in re-opening a discussion regarding a possible strategic transaction\nwith Party A, which included, among other things, the synergies of the combined companies, possible leakage of\ninformation to a competitor. The representatives of Centerview also discussed the material terms that a process letter\nwould contain, and the number of companies that would be solicited in a targeted outreach. The process letter would\nprovide, among other things, that offers would be \u201cbest and final\u201d and the auction merger agreement would contain\nan explicit \u201cgo shop\u201d right, with a \u201cbreak fee\u201d, permitting solicitation of other bids after a merger agreement was\nexecuted. Thereafter, the members of the Board expressed substantial support on proceeding with a targeted process\nwith a one-month period for bidders to respond.\nOn March 7, 2021, Mr. Remington, Mr. Ogawa and Mr. Page had a videoconference with Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka of\nParent. Mr. Remington said that, given the long-expressed interest of Parent in acquiring the Company, along with\nParent\u2019s apparent inability to act currently on that interest as Parent had previously told the Company that\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nParent could not actively engage in a process and conduct due diligence until April 1, 2021, as a matter of courtesy\nand in case Parent might be able to accelerate its ability to act on its interest, representatives of the Company wanted\nto inform Parent of the then-current unsolicited interest of third parties to purchase the Company. Mr. Remington\nfurther noted that (i) two unsolicited parties had expressed an interest in purchasing the Company, (ii) the Board had\nresponded by initiating a new strategic process, and (iii) in order to have a sufficiently competitive process, the\nCompany directed Centerview to reach out to a small group of previously interested parties to participate in the\nprocess. Mr. Remington then noted that the purpose of the call was to see if Parent was interested in participating in\nthe process based on the following terms: one month of due diligence, starting with access to a data room and ending\nwith bid\u037e one bidding round, with a best and final bid\u037e and a commencement of the process as soon as the following\nweek and possibility as late as starting April 1, 2020. The representatives of Parent stated that they were not sure if\nthey could meet the outlined timeframe and would get back to the Company about Parent\u2019s ability to participate in the\nprocess.\nOn March 8, 2021, Mr. Remington, Mr. Page attended a videoconference with a representative of Centerview and a\nrepresentative of Perkins Coie, during which the representative of Perkins Coie provided Mr. Remington and Mr. Page\nwith an overview of the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale of the Company and\nrepresentatives of Centerview presented their recommendations regarding the structure of a potential targeted\nstrategic alternatives process.\nOn March 11, 2021, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by representatives of\nCenterview and Perkins Coie. The purpose of the meeting was to decide on whether to proceed with a targeted\nstrategic alternatives process and to provide the full Board with access to the advice from the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisor and primary outside counsel that had been provided to Mr. Remington and Mr. Page during in the call held\non March 8, 2021. A representative of Perkins Coie discussed the legal framework under which the Board should\nconsider the potential process, including an overview of the prior strategic alternatives process in 2020 and another\noverview of its fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale of the Company. Following Perkins Coie\u2019s\npresentation, the representatives of Centerview and the Board discussed Centerview\u2019s recommendations regarding\nthe structure of a targeted strategic alternatives process and Centerview\u2019s advice that, in light of the extensive\nstrategic alternatives process in 2019 through 2020, a more targeted strategic process could be effectively run. The\nrepresentatives of Centerview recommended contacting eight parties, including three potential strategic buyers,\nincluding Parent, and five potential financial sponsor buyers that appeared financially qualified and known to be\ninterested in infrastructure investments (collectively, the \u201c2021 Outreach Parties\u201d). Furthermore, it was noted that the\n2021 Outreach Parties were selected because of their industry knowledge, their prior expressed interest in the\nCompany, and their perceived \u201cability to do a deal.\u201d In addition, Board members expressed their support of an\nefficient process of roughly four to five weeks and believed that it was an opportune time from the perspective of\nstockholders to sell, and that it had taken all reasonable steps to select the bidders best positioned to complete a\ntransaction in a timely manner and at a favorable price. Further, the Board decided to extend the timeframe for the\ntargeted strategic alternatives process for all potentially interested parties until the end of April 2021. The Board\nconcluded that, based on the in-depth review of the proposed design of the targeted strategic alternatives process\nthat it had engaged in over time, including meetings with representatives of Centerview formally (in Board meetings)\nand informally (in Board updates) on February 12, 2021, February 24, 2021, March 2, 2021 and March 11, 2021 and the\nadvice of representatives of Centerview, as well as the experience of Board members, that a targeted strategic\nalternatives process could be conducted with a limited number of potential bidders in a manner designed to be in the\nbest interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Board then unanimously approved proceeding with a targeted\nstrategic alternatives process, consistent with Centerview\u2019s recommendations.\nOn March 12, 2021, Mr. Yasuno emailed Mr. Remington to let him know that Parent would be able to engage in the\nstrategic alternatives process, as outlined by the Company, on April 1, 2021.\nOn March 14, 2021, Mr. Remington emailed Mr. Yasuno to inform him that the Board had decided to set April 30, 2021\nas the bid date for Parent and other bidders to provide Parent with a draft of an amendment to the non-disclosure\nagreement that the parties had entered into on January 6, 2020, which included a standstill provision.\nBetween March 14, 2021 and March 22, 2021, representatives of Centerview distributed process letters to\nrepresentatives of the 2021 Outreach Parties.\nOn March 15, 2021, Mr. Remington attended a videoconference with representatives of Centerview and\nrepresentatives of Perkins Coie to discuss acceptable joint venture bidding partners for Party E.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn April 21, 2021, Mr. Remington attended a videoconference with the chairman of the board of directors of Party E,\nat his request, to discuss prospective aspects of Party E\u2019s bid.\nAlso, on April 21, 2021, Mr. Remington had a call with Mr. Page, representatives of Centerview and representatives of\nPerkins Coie to report on the videoconference with the chairman of the board of directors of Party E.\nOn April 27, 2021, at the request of Parent, a conference call was held among representatives of Parent\u2019s financial\nadvisor, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, Parent\u2019s outside U.S. counsel (\u201cDavis Polk\u201d), Centerview and Perkins Coie.\nDuring the call, Davis Polk and Parent\u2019s financial advisor explained that, due to a Japanese tax issue, if Parent was to\nbid for the Company, the Migrating Subsidiaries, the Company\u2019s primary offshore subsidiaries, would need to first\n\u201cmigrate\u201d to the United States. The parties then discussed an analysis of how the proposed Migration would be\neffected.\nAlso, on April 27, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Perkins\nCoie. Among other things, the Board discussed the status of the targeted strategic alternatives process, including\nthe timing for receipt of bids, and tentatively reserved time on the mornings of May 4, 2021 for a Board meeting to\nreview and make preliminary decisions about bids, and a further Board meeting on May 6, 2021 to make final\ndecisions, both meetings to be attended by the Company\u2019s outside legal and financial advisors.\nOn April 28, 2021, Mr. Remington, Mr. Ogawa and Mr. Page had a video call with Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka, at the\nrequest of Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka. Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka wanted to know whether the Migration, as a condition\nof Parent\u2019s bid, would be acceptable to the Company. The Company\u2019s representatives said that the Company was\nopen to the Migration, understood the rationale from a Japanese tax perspective, and preliminarily did not think the\nMigration would be problematic.\nOn April 29, 2021, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the first quarter of 2021 and\nthat the Board had declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. The Company\u2019s common stock closed\ntrading at $43.54 per share on the NYSE.\nOn April 30, 2021, the Board (other than Mr. Remington), representatives of Perkins Coie and representatives of\nCenterview attended a reverse due diligence call with representatives of Party A.\nAlso, on April 30, 2021, following entry into non-disclosure agreements or amended non-disclosure agreements with\nthe parties, as applicable, the Board received three proposals: (i) a bid from Party A for a stock for stock merger at an\nexchange ratio of 0.85 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock, which was equivalent to a price of $42.64 per share\nof the Company\u2019s common stock\u037e (ii) a bid from Party E to acquire the Company for $48.55 per share, in cash\u037e (iii) a\nbid from Parent to acquire the Company for $56.00 per share of common stock, in cash, as well as a mark-up of the\ndraft Merger Agreement.

At the meeting, the Board\nformed a new special committee (the \u201cSecond Special Committee\u201d), comprised of Mr. Remington and Mr. Page, which\nwas tasked with engaging in discussions and negotiations regarding a definitive agreement should the Board\ndetermine to move forward with one of the potential bidders, though authority to ultimately approve any transaction\nremained with the Board.\nOn May 7, 2021, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by representatives of\nCenterview and representatives of Perkins Coie, to further discuss the bids received on April 30, 2021 and whether to\nnegotiate with bidders. At the meeting, the Board determined to move forward with Parent because of the per share\noffer price, the overall strength of the offer, the seriousness of the bid considering the amount of work that had been\ndone to put together the proposal and mark up the draft Merger Agreement, and the overall likelihood of closing. The\nBoard also discussed aspects of the Migration and the absence of a \u201cgo shop\u201d provision, noting that the Company\ncould still entertain unsolicited offers.\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn May 10, 2021, the Second Special Committee met with representatives of Centerview and representatives of\nPerkins Coie via videoconference to discuss an issues list related to Parent\u2019s mark-up of the draft Merger Agreement.\nKey issues discussed included the price, the \u201cfiduciary out provisions,\u201d the Migration, Parent\u2019s right to terminate the\nMerger Agreement and the Termination Fee.\nFrom May 10, 2021 to June 15, 2021 representatives of Centerview held numerous discussions with the financial\nadvisor of Parent.

The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of, Centerview,\nnor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those\nfinancial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than\nother assumptions, so the reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized\nbelow should not be taken to be Centerview\u2019s view of the actual value of the Company. Some of the summaries of the\nfinancial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the\nfinancial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not\nconstitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the\ntables below without considering all financial analyses or factors or the full narrative description of such analyses\nor factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors, could create a\nmisleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview\u2019s financial analyses and its opinion. In\nperforming its analyses, Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general\nbusiness and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company or any\nother parties to the Transaction. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or Centerview or any other person\nassumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in\nthese analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the Company\ndo not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the Company may actually be sold. Accordingly, the\nassumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is\nbased on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before June 15, 2021 and is not necessarily indicative\nof current market conditions.\nSelected Public Company Analysis\nCenterview reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for the Company to\ncorresponding financial information, ratios and multiples for publicly traded companies that Centerview deemed\ncomparable, based on its experience and professional judgment, to the Company, which selected publicly traded\ncompanies we refer to in this summary of Centerview\u2019s opinion as the \u201cselected companies\u201d. The selected companies\nconsisted of:\n\u2022\nTextainer Group Holdings Limited\n\u2022\nTriton International Limited\nAlthough neither of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, these companies were selected,\namong other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with certain operational and financial\ncharacteristics, which, for purposes of its analyses, Centerview considered to be similar to those of the Company.\nHowever, because neither of the selected companies is exactly the same as the Company, Centerview believed that it\nwas inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected public company\nanalysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional\njudgment, concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of the\nCompany and the selected companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context\nin which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.\n61\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUsing publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources and closing stock prices as of\nJune 15, 2021, Centerview calculated for each company, the ratio of price of a share of such company\u2019s common stock\nto the company\u2019s book value per share (a ratio referred to as \u201cP/BV\u201d). To arrive at each company\u2019s book value per\nshare, Centerview divided the company\u2019s total stockholders\u2019 equity minus preferred equity, plus net deferred tax\nliabilities by its fully diluted common shares outstanding. This analysis resulted in a median P/BV multiple, including\ndeferred tax liabilities, of 1.34x.\nBased on its experience and professional judgment, for purposes of its analysis, Centerview selected a P/BV\nreference range of 1.25x to 1.45x. In selecting this reference range, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on\nits experience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating\ncharacteristics of the Company and the selected companies that could affect their public trading values in order to\nprovide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. Centerview applied the P/BV reference\nrange to the Company\u2019s first quarter 2021 book value, including deferred tax liabilities. Centerview calculated an\nimplied per share equity value range for each share of common stock of $46.02 to $53.35. Centerview then compared\nthese ranges to the implied value of the Common Merger Consideration of $56.00 per share of common stock.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nCenterview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company based on the Company Forecasts, which\nincluded both a \u201cbase case\u201d and an \u201cupside case.\u201d A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation\nmethodology used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the \u201cpresent value\u201d of estimated future cash flows\nof the asset. \u201cPresent value\u201d refers to the current value of future cash flows and is obtained by discounting those\nfuture cash flows by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the\nopportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.\nIn performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range of illustrative equity values for the Company by applying a\ndiscount rate range of 10.0% to 12.5% (reflecting Centerview\u2019s analysis of the Company\u2019s cost of equity) and the mid-\nyear convention to (a) the forecasted after-tax levered free cash flows of the Company for the last three fiscal quarters\nof 2021 and for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 set forth in Company management\u2019s base case and upside case\nforecasts at the direction of the Company and assumptions discussed with the Company management and (b) a range\nof illustrative terminal values for the Company, calculated by Centerview applying terminal price to next twelve-month\nearnings multiples ranging from 6.0x to 8.0x terminal year net income. Centerview then divided these implied equity\nvalues by the number of fully-diluted outstanding shares of common stock as of March 31, 2021, as set forth in the\nCompany Internal Data to derive a range of implied per share equity value for each share of common stock as of\nMarch 31, 2021, of $37.55 to $50.15, based on the base case Company Forecasts, and $40.44 to $54.21, based on the\nupside case Company Forecasts. Centerview then compared these ranges to the implied value of the Common Merger\nConsideration of $56.00 per share of common stock.\nOther Factors\nCenterview noted for the Board certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including, among other\nthings, the following:\n\u2022\nSelected Public Company Analysis. Using the same P/BV reference range for the Company as described\nabove, Centerview noted the Company\u2019s first quarter 2021 book value, excluding deferred tax liabilities,\nimplied a per share equity value range for each share of common stock of $44.21 to $51.25 per share of\ncommon stock.\n\u2022\nHistorical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed the historical closing trading prices of the\nshares of common stock for the 52-week period prior to June 15, 2021, which reflected low and high closing\ntrading prices during such 52-week period of $15.63 to $48.73 per share of common stock.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most\nappropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular\ncircumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its\nopinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis that it\nconsidered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional\njudgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCenterview\u2019s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in\nits evaluation of the Transaction. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative\nof the views of the Board or management of the Company with respect to the Common Merger Consideration or as to\nwhether the Board would have been willing to determine that a different consideration was fair. The consideration for\nthe Transaction was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was\napproved by the Board. Centerview provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Centerview did not,\nhowever recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or the Board or that any specific amount\nof consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Transaction.\nCenterview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment\nbanking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion\nCenterview had been engaged to provide financial advisory services to the Company, including in connection with\nvarious strategic matters, and Centerview received approximately $1,000,000 in compensation from the Company for\nsuch services. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview had not been engaged to provide\nfinancial advisory or other services to Parent or Merger Sub, and Centerview did not receive any compensation from\nParent during such period. Centerview may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the\nCompany or Parent or their respective affiliates in the future, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain\n(i) of Centerview and Centerview affiliates\u2019 directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such\npersons, (ii) of Centerview\u2019s affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which\nany of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold,\nsell or trade, in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other\nobligations) of, or investments in, the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates or any other relevant\nparties that may be involved in the Transaction.\nThe Board selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Transaction based on Centerview\u2019s\nreputation, knowledge of the Company and its industry, relationships with other potential strategic or financial\nbuyers and experience. Centerview is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial\nexperience in transactions similar to the Transaction.\nIn connection with Centerview\u2019s services as the financial advisor to the Board, the Company has agreed to pay\nCenterview an aggregate fee that is estimated to be approximately $21,000,000, $1,000,000 of which was payable upon\nthe rendering of Centerview\u2019s opinion and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the\nTransaction.

            "text": "Management Projections\nThe Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to its future\nperformance, revenues, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and\nsubjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the Board\u2019s consideration of\nthe Merger, the Company\u2019s management prepared and developed unaudited financial projections regarding the\nCompany\u2019s future performance for the fiscal years 2021 to 2025. On June 7, 2021, management discussed with the\nBoard a set of unaudited financial projections, with \u201cbase case\u201d and \u201cupside case\u201d models (the \u201cmanagement\nprojections\u201d). On June 10, 2021, the Board approved the use of the management projections by Centerview in\nconnection with its financial analysis, as described under \u201c-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC.\u201d A summary of the\nmanagement projections has been included below.\nThe management projections were made available to the Board and Centerview, but were not made available to, or\ndiscussed with, potential purchasers, including Parent, in connection with the process resulting in the execution of\nthe Merger Agreement. The summary of the management projections set forth below is included herein only because\nthe management projections were used at the Board\u2019s direction by Centerview in connection with its financial\nanalysis relating to the Common Merger Consideration, but the management projections were not distributed to\npotential purchasers. However, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as an indication that any\nparty considered, or now considers, the management projections to be a reliable prediction of future results. The\nmanagement projections are subjective in many respects and are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic\nrevisions based on actual experience and business developments. Although presented with numerical specificity, the\nmanagement projections are based upon, and reflect, numerous judgments, estimates and assumptions made by the\nCompany\u2019s management with respect to, among other things, industry performance,\n63TABLE OF CONTENTS\ngeneral business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters\nspecific to the Company\u2019s business, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s\ncontrol. As such, the management projections constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results projected, including the factors\ndescribed under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d As a result, we cannot assure you that\nthe estimates and assumptions made in preparing the management projections will prove accurate, that the projected\nresults will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected results. In addition,\nthe management projections cover multiple years through fiscal year 2025 and such information by its nature\nbecomes less reliable with each successive year. Accordingly, this summary of the management projections is not\nbeing included in this proxy statement to influence your decision whether to vote in favor of any proposal.\nSome or all of the assumptions that have been made regarding, among other things, the occurrence or the timing of\ncertain events or impacts may have changed since the date the management projections were prepared, and the\nsummary of the management projections set forth below does not take into account any circumstances or events\noccurring after the date the management projections were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger and\ntransaction-related expenses. The management projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the\nMerger to occur and should not be viewed as accurate in that context.\nThe management projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure. The management projections are\nincluded in this proxy statement only because they were made available to Centerview for use in connection with its\nfinancial analysis, as described under \u201c-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC,\u201d but they were not distributed to\npotential purchasers, including Parent, in connection with the process resulting in the execution of the Merger\nAgreement. The management projections do not, and were not intended to, act as public guidance regarding our\nfinancial performance. Accordingly, the inclusion of the management projections in this proxy statement should not\nbe regarded as an indication that Parent, the Board, the Company\u2019s management, Centerview or any of their\nrespective affiliates or representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the\nmanagement projections to be predictive of future results. No one has made or makes any representation to any\nstockholder regarding the information included in the management projections set forth below. We have made no\nrepresentation to Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement concerning these financial forecasts.\nFurthermore, the management projections were not prepared with a view to compliance with (1) generally accepted\naccounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) in the United States\u037e (2) the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections\nand forward-looking statements\u037e or (3) the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. KPMG LLP, our independent\nregistered public accounting firm, has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied procedures to the\nmanagement projections and, accordingly, assumes no responsibility for, and expresses no opinion on, them. The\nmanagement projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the\nCompany\u2019s management.\nAfter-Tax Levered Free Cash Flow (as defined below) contained in the management projections set forth below is a\nnon-GAAP financial measure, which is a financial performance measure that is not calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may\nbe different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, which limits its usefulness\nas a comparative measure. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they\nexclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. The items excluded from net\nincome to common stockholders to arrive at this non-GAAP financial measure are significant components for\nunderstanding and assessing the Company\u2019s financial performance and liquidity. Accordingly, this non-GAAP\nfinancial measure should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP.\nFinancial measures used by a financial advisor are excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures\nunder SEC rules and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures,\nwhich would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. A\nreconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure was not relied upon by Centerview for purposes of its financial\nanalysis as described above in \u201c-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC\u201d or the Board in connection with its\nconsideration of the Merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure\nincluded in the management projections to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExcept to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any\nresponsibility, to update or otherwise revise the management projections to reflect circumstances existing after the\ndate when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions\nunderlying the management projections are shown to be in error or no longer appropriate. In light of the foregoing\nfactors and the uncertainties inherent in the management projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place\nundue reliance on the projections included in this proxy statement.\nThe summaries of the financial forecasts performed by management include information presented in tabular\nformat. In order to fully understand management\u2019s analyses and projections, the tables must be read together with\nthe assumptions underlying such forecasts. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of\nmanagement\u2019s analyses and projections. Considering the data described below without considering the full\nnarrative description of management\u2019s analyses and projections, including the assumptions underlying the\nanalyses and projections, could create a misleading or incomplete view of management\u2019s analyses and projections.\nIn preparing the management projections, our management made the following material assumptions for each of the\nbase case and the upside case, except as noted below:\n\u2022\ncost per standard cargo unit (new container pricing) of $2,989 in fiscal year 2021, $2,275 in fiscal year 2022\nand $2,100 in each of fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025\u037e\n\u2022\naverage utilization per fiscal year of 99.6% in fiscal year 2021, 98.8% in fiscal year 2022 and 98.0% in each of\nfiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025\u037e\n\u2022\nbase fleet per diem rate per standard cargo unit as of the end of each fiscal year of $0.552 in fiscal year 2021,\n$0.544 in fiscal year 2022, $0.535 in fiscal year 2023, $0.527 in fiscal year 2024 and $0.520 in fiscal year 2025\u037e\n\u2022\ncash on cash return for new investment of 10.5% in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2025\u037e\n\u2022\nnew finance lease unlevered internal rate of return of 7.5% in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2025\u037e\n\u2022\ntotal container investment per year of:\n\u25cb\nwith respect to the base case, $1,100 million in fiscal year 2021 and $600.0 million in each of fiscal years\n2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025\u037e and\n\u25cb\nwith respect to the upside case, $1,300 million in fiscal year 2021 and $700.0 million in each of fiscal\nyears 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025\u037e\n\u2022\ngain on sale of containers of $16.3 million in fiscal year 2021, $9.0 million in fiscal year 2022, $9.5 million in\nfiscal year 2023, $10.0 million in fiscal year 2024 and $10.5 million in fiscal year 2025\u037e\n\u2022\nhandling cost as a percentage of total operating lease revenue of 1.0% in each of fiscal years 2021 through\n2025\u037e\n\u2022\nrepair costs as a percentage of total operating lease revenue of 2.0% in each of fiscal years 2021 through\n2025\u037e\n\u2022\nother expenses as a percentage of total operating lease revenue of 1.5% in each of fiscal years 2021 through\n2025\u037e and\n\u2022\ndepreciation expense per standard cargo unit on new investment of $13.88 in fiscal year 2021, $9.30 in fiscal\nyear 2022 and $8.18 in each of fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025.\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSummary of Projections",

Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 of the\nDGCL is required. Failure to timely and properly comply with such statutory requirements will result in the loss of\nyour appraisal rights.\nThis section summarizes certain material provisions of the DGCL pertaining to appraisal rights. The following\ndiscussion, however, is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy\nstatement and incorporated by reference herein.

It is possible that any such \u201cfair value\u201d as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, the applicable Merger Consideration which\nstockholders will be entitled to receive upon the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nThese rights are known as appraisal rights.\n73TABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, not less than 20 days prior to the Special Meeting at which the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, we must notify each stockholder who was a stockholder on\nthe Record Date and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the\nnotice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL.

            "text": "Filing a Written Demand\nTo the extent a holder is entitled to vote, neither voting against the Merger Proposal, nor abstaining from voting or\nfailing to vote on the Merger Proposal, will in and of itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the\nrequirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. Any holder of shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock wishing to\nexercise appraisal rights must deliver to us, before the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special\nMeeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares. A stockholder\u2019s failure to deliver the written\ndemand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of\nappraisal rights. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to, and separate from, any proxy or vote on the\nMerger Proposal.\nA demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. Only a holder of record may\ndemand appraisal rights for the shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, registered in that\n74TABLE OF CONTENTS\nholder\u2019s name. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs us of the identity of the stockholder and that\nthe stockholder intends to demand appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners who do not\nalso hold their shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, of record may not directly make\nappraisal demands to us. The beneficial owner must, in such case, arrange for the holder of record, such as a broker,\nbank or other nominee, to timely submit the required demand in respect of those shares of common stock or Preferred\nStock. A holder of record, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, who holds shares of common stock or Preferred\nStock as a nominee or intermediary for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of common\nstock or Preferred Stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial\nowners. The written demand should state the number of shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock as to which\nappraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of common stock or Preferred Stock is expressly mentioned, the\ndemand will be presumed to cover all shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, held in the name\nof the holder of record.\nIF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK\nACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU\nSHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BROKER, BANK, TRUSTEE OR OTHER NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BROKER, BANK, TRUSTEE OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A\nDEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF\nCOMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH\nAS A NOMINEE OR INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE HOLDER OF RECORD TO\nFOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO DEMAND YOUR APPRAISAL\nRIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED STOCK THROUGH A\nBROKERAGE OR BANK WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE SHARES THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES\nDEPOSITORY NOMINEE, SUCH AS THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF\nSUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY, OR ON BEHALF OF, THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY\nTHE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD.\nIf your shares of common stock or Preferred Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,\nguardian or custodian, execution of the demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if your shares are\nowned of record jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand for\nappraisal should be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for\ntwo or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record\u037e however, the agent must\nidentify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is\nacting as agent for the holder or holders of record. Stockholders who hold their shares of common stock or Preferred\nStock in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult\nwith their brokers or other nominees to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal\nby such a nominee.\nIf you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand\nto:\nCAI International, Inc.\nAttention: Secretary\nSteuart Tower, 1 Market Plaza\nSuite 2400\nSan Francisco, California 94105\nTelephone: (415) 788-0100\nAt any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder that made a demand for appraisal but has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined in such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw\nthe demand and to accept the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her\nor its shares of common stock or Preferred Stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of\nthe demand for appraisal, but after such 60 day period a demand for appraisal may be withdrawn only with the written\napproval of the surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed\nas to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be\nconditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that any\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may\n75\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwithdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the applicable Merger Consideration within 60 days after the\nEffective Time. If CAI, as the surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal\nwhen that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand\nin accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not\napprove the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to\nreceive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal\nto or more than the applicable Merger Consideration.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation. Within 10 days after the Effective Time, CAI, as the surviving corporation,\nmust notify each holder of common stock and Preferred Stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant\nto Section 262 of the DGCL and, to the extent they are entitled to vote, has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal\nof the date that the Merger has become effective.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but\nnot later, either you, provided you have complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and are otherwise\nentitled to appraisal rights, or the surviving corporation may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by\nyou, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of common stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, held by all\nstockholders who have properly demanded statutory appraisal. None of Parent, Merger Sub or CAI, as the surviving\ncorporation is under any obligation to file an appraisal petition or has any intention to do so. If you desire to have\nyour shares of common stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary\nfor properly demanding your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of\nthe DGCL. The failure of a holder of common stock or Preferred Stock to file such a petition within the time periods\nspecified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the\nDGCL, you will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth\nthe aggregate number of shares of common stock not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal and Preferred Stock, in\neach case, with respect to which we have received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of\nthose shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of (i) 10 days after receipt by\nthe surviving corporation of the request therefor or (ii) 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands\nfor appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of common stock or Preferred Stock held in a voting trust or by\na nominee on your behalf you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the surviving\ncorporation the statement described in this paragraph.\nIf a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or if you deliver to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of your\ndemand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter\nwith the written approval of the surviving corporation, then the right to appraisal will cease.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record of common stock or Preferred Stock who has\nproperly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and a\ncopy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will be obligated, within 20\ndays after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Court of Chancery a duly verified list\ncontaining the names and addresses of all holders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of common stock\nand/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been\nreached by the surviving corporation. After notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by\nregistered or certified mail to the surviving corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses\ntherein stated as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the\npetition to determine which stockholders have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and have become entitled to\nappraisal rights and may require the stockholders demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares of common stock\nor Preferred Stock to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency\nof the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any\nstockholder who fails to comply with this direction. Such notice shall also be given by one or more publications at\nleast one week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of\nWilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The forms of the\nnotices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs thereof shall\nbe borne by the surviving corporation. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as\nto all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (a) with respect to the shares of\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncommon stock, (i) the total number of shares of common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding\nshares of common stock, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares\nof common stock exceeds $1.0 million, or (b) with respect to each series of Preferred Stock, (i) the total number of\nshares of such series of Preferred Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of such series of\nPreferred Stock, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares of such\nseries of Preferred Stock exceeds $1.0 million, as applicable.\nThe appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of common stock or Preferred Stock owned by such\nstockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine\nthe fair value of the shares of common stock and Preferred Stock held by all stockholders who have properly\ndemanded their appraisal rights as of the Effective Time, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to\nbe the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause\nshown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the Effective Time through the\ndate of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time\nand the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any stockholder\nentitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to\ntrial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder\nwhose name appears on the list filed by the surviving corporation and who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s\ncertificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is\nfinally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal. At any time before the entry of judgment in the\nproceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which\ncase interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest\ntheretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndirect the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same,\nforthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders to the surviving\ncorporation of their stock certificates.\nIn determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining\nfair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally\nconsidered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered and that\n\u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d An opinion of\nan investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger\nis not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of common stock and\nPreferred Stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as or less than the\napplicable Merger Consideration. Neither Parent nor CAI, as the surviving corporation, anticipates offering more than\nthe applicable Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in\nany appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of common stock\nor Preferred Stock is less than the Common Merger Consideration, the Series A Merger Consideration or the Series B\nMerger Consideration, as applicable. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nIf no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time, you will lose the right to an appraisal\nand will instead receive the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement, in cash,\nwithout interest, subject to deductions of any applicable withholding taxes.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include\nattorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) and may tax those costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court\nof Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal\nproceeding, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against\nthe value of all shares of common stock and Preferred Stock, as applicable, entitled to appraisal. In the absence of\nsuch an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses.\n77\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you will not, from and after the\nEffective Time, be entitled to vote your shares subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or\nother distributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of common\nstock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, as of a record date prior to the Effective Time.\nIf you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may withdraw\na demand for appraisal and accept the applicable Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the\ndemand for appraisal and an acceptance of the consideration payable in the Merger to the surviving corporation,\nexcept that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of\nthe surviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any\nstockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any\nstockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such\nproceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in\nthe Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If you fail to properly demand or successfully withdraw your\ndemand for appraisal, or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares will be deemed to have been converted as\nof the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, in cash, without interest, subject\nto deductions of any applicable withholding taxes.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for properly demanding appraisal rights may result in\nthe loss of your appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration for\nyour shares in accordance with the Merger Agreement.\nTHE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE\nWITH THE TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL. TO THE EXTENT\nTHERE ARE ANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE\nDGCL, THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",

This discussion is based\non the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), applicable U.S. Treasury\nregulations, judicial opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d), each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive\nbasis, and any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.\nThis discussion does not address Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, nor does it address any tax\nconsiderations under state, local or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal\nincome tax. This discussion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and, therefore, could be subject to challenge,\nwhich could be sustained. No ruling is intended to be sought from the IRS with respect to the Merger.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of our capital stock that\nis:\n\u2022\na citizen or individual resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\na trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust\u2019s\nadministration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust\nor (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S.\nperson\u037e or\n\u2022\nan estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our capital stock, other than a\npartnership or other entity taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is not a U.S. Holder.\n78TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThis discussion applies only to holders of shares of our capital stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within\nthe meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not\npurport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder in light of its particular\ncircumstances, or that may apply to a holder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws\n(including, for example, insurance companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies,\ndealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of tax\naccounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result\nof any item of gross income with respect to shares of our capital stock being taken into account in an applicable\nfinancial statement, persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations,\nbanks and certain other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain expatriates, partnerships, S corporations, or other\npass-through entities or investors in partnerships or such other entities, persons who hold shares of our capital\nstock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction, U.S. Holders who will hold, directly or\nindirectly, an equity interest in the surviving corporation in the Merger, and persons who acquired their shares of our\ncapital stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements).\nIf a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes) holds shares of our capital stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally\ndepend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership.

Any portion of such payments that exceeds such\nearnings and profits will first be applied to reduce a U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such holder\u2019s shares of capital\nstock on a share-by-share basis, and the excess will be treated as gain from the disposition of the shares, the tax\ntreatment of which is discussed under \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger -\nConsequences to U.S. Holders-Exchange of Shares Pursuant to the Merger.\u201d\nUnder current law, dividends received by individual holders of capital stock generally will be subject to a reduced\ngraduated tax rates of up to 20% if such dividends are treated as \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. Amounts treated as return of capital are tax-free to the extent of the applicable tax basis. Amounts\nclassified as long-term capital gains generally are subject to the same graduated rates. Individual stockholders should\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of these rules in light of their particular\ncircumstances.\nDividends received by corporate stockholders generally will be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Each\ndomestic corporate holder of capital stock is urged to consult with its tax advisors with respect to the eligibility for\nand the amount of any dividends received deduction and the potential application of the \u201cextraordinary dividend\u201d\nrules of Section 1059 of the Code to any declared but unpaid dividends it may receive on our capital stock.\nExchange of Shares Pursuant to the Merger\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. Holders in exchange for shares of our capital stock pursuant to the Merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the discussion above with respect to declared but\nunpaid dividends under \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger-Consequences to U.S.\nHolders-Declared but Unpaid Dividends by U.S. Holders,\u201d in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.\nHolder who receives cash in exchange for shares of our capital stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or\nloss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received (computed as if there were\nno applicable withholding taxes) and (ii) the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares, which generally will\nequal the price the U.S. Holder paid for such shares.\n79TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf a U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of our capital stock surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year\nas of the date of the Merger, the gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains\nof certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential\nrates (currently at a rate of 20%). The deductibility of a capital loss recognized on the exchange is subject to\nlimitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of shares of our capital stock at different times and different\nprices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each\nblock of shares of our capital stock (i.e., shares of our capital stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction).",

A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may also be subject\nto an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income\ntax treaty) on after-tax profits effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that such after-tax\nprofits are not reinvested and maintained in the U.S. business.\nGain described in the second bullet above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat 30% rate, or a\nreduced rate if specified by an applicable income tax treaty, but may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses, if\nany, of the Non-U.S. Holder recognized in the same taxable year.\nWith respect to the third bullet above, generally, the Company will be a USRPHC if the fair market value of our U.S.\nreal property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market values of our worldwide (domestic and\nforeign) real property interests and other assets used or held for use in a trade or business, all as determined under\napplicable U.S. Treasury regulations. We believe that we currently are not a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, and we do not expect to become a USRPHC prior to the Closing. However, even if we were to be a\nUSRPHC, so long as our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, common stock held by\na Non-U.S. Holder would be treated as a U.S. real property interest only if the Non-U.S. Holder actually or\nconstructively held more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the shorter of the five-year period\npreceding the disposition or the Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period for shares of our common stock. If a Non-U.S.\nHolder holds Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock or acquired interests in the Company on more\nthan one date, the holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the application of these rules. If shares of our\ncapital stock were to be treated as a U.S. real property interest with respect to a holder, any gain recognized by such\nNon-U.S. Holder with respect to such interest would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at\nregular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such holder were a \u201cU.S. person\u201d as defined\nunder the Code.\nDeclared but Unpaid Dividends by Non-U.S. Holders\nTo the extent that any cash received by Non-U.S. Holders pursuant to the Merger is attributable to any declared but\nunpaid dividends on such Non-U.S. Holders\u2019 capital stock, such payments will be treated as dividends to the extent\nof our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under the Code and may be subject to\nwithholding as discussed below. Any portion of such payments that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings\n80TABLE OF CONTENTS\nand profits will first be applied to reduce a Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s capital\nstock and, to the extent such portion exceeds the Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis, the excess will be treated as\ngain from the disposition of the shares, the tax treatment of which is discussed under \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income\nTax Consequences of the Merger - Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders - Exchange of Shares Pursuant to the\nMerger.\u201d\nDividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder of capital stock will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate if specified by an applicable income tax treaty. However, dividends that are effectively\nconnected with the conduct of a trade or business by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United States (and, if required\nby any applicable income tax treaty, attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base of the Non-\nU.S. Holder) are not subject to the withholding tax, provided that certain certification and disclosure requirements are\nsatisfied, including completing IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form). Instead, such dividends generally will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same\nmanner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a \u201cU.S. person\u201d as defined under the Code, unless an applicable income tax\ntreaty applies. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a\nrate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on after-tax profits effectively\nconnected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that such after-tax profits are not reinvested and maintained in\nthe U.S. business.\nA Non-U.S. Holder of capital stock who wishes to claim the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty rate and avoid\nbackup withholding, as discussed below, for dividends will be required to (i) complete IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-\n8BEN-E (or other applicable form) and certify under penalty of perjury that such holder is not a United States person\nas defined under the Code and is eligible for treaty benefits, or (ii) if the capital stock is held through certain foreign\nintermediaries, satisfy the relevant certification requirements of applicable Treasury regulations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding",

Therefore, our current\nstockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of the surviving corporation and will not benefit\nfrom any appreciation in value of the surviving corporation that could be realized as a result of improvements to the\nsurviving corporation\u2019s operations.\nThe certificate of incorporation of the Company will be amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety as the\ncertificate of incorporation of Merger Sub (other than the corporate name) until thereafter amended as provided\ntherein or by applicable laws.

In addition, the Company\u2019s common stock and Preferred Stock will be\nderegistered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will no longer file periodic or current reports with the SEC.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe Closing of the Merger will take place remotely via the electronic exchange of documents and signatures, on a\ndate no later than four business days after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the\nMerger Agreement, waiver by the party having the benefit of the applicable condition of the closing conditions\nstated in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,\nbut subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the Merger Agreement,\nwaiver by the party having the benefit of the applicable condition of such conditions) or at such other date and time\nas the parties to the Merger Agreement may mutually agree in writing.\nThe Merger will become effective at the time the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware (or at such later time as is agreed upon by the parties to the Merger Agreement and specified in the\ncertificate of merger). We expect to complete the Merger as promptly as practicable after our common stockholders\nadopt the Merger Agreement (assuming the prior satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) of the\nother closing conditions to the Merger, including the Migration, as described below under the caption \u201c-Conditions\nto the Contribution, Migration Filings and Merger\u201d). As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete\nthe Merger in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2021\u037e however, consummation of the Merger is subject to\nthe satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions to the completion of the\nMerger, including the Migration, more fully described below under the caption \u201c-Conditions to the Contribution,\nMigration Filings and Merger\u201d and we cannot specify when, or assure you that, the Company, Parent and Merger\nSub will satisfy or waive all or any conditions to the Merger.
