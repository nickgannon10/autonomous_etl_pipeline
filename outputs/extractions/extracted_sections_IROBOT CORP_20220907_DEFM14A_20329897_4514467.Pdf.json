If our stockholders fail to approve and adopt the\nmerger agreement, the merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, and the material\nprovisions of the merger agreement are described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d\nThe vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a\nstockholder may vote to approve the compensation proposal and vote not to approve and adopt the merger agreement and vice versa. Because the\nvote on the compensation proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Amazon.com. Accordingly, if the\nmerger agreement is approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to the\nCompany\u2019s executive officers even if the stockholders fail to approve the compensation proposal.\n1Table of Contents\niRobot does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and only\nthe matters specified in the notice of the special meeting may be considered or acted upon at the special meeting.\nThis proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our stockholders on or about September 7, 2022, and the mailing\nis expected to be completed on or about September 14, 2022.",

If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and you also wish to be able to vote virtually at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy,\nexecuted in your favor, from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nVoting Virtually\nIf you plan to virtually attend the special meeting and wish to vote virtually, you will be given a virtual ballot at the special meeting. If you are\nnot a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of iRobot common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are\nencouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting. If you virtually attend the special meeting and vote by virtual\nballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.\nProviding Voting Instructions by Proxy\nTo ensure that your shares of iRobot common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions\npromptly by proxy, even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting.\nShares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described below.\nSubmit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting voting\ninstructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet address specified on the\nenclosed proxy card. Your shares of iRobot common stock will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and\nreturned your proxy card, as described below.\nSubmit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the special\nmeeting, your shares of iRobot common stock will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of the proposal\nto approve and adopt the merger agreement, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. If you fail to return your proxy card and you\nare a holder of record on the record date, unless you virtually attend the special meeting and vote virtually, the effect will be that your shares of\niRobot common stock will not be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special\nmeeting, will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and, assuming a quorum is\npresent, will not affect the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.\n3Table of Contents\nShares of iRobot Common Stock Held in \u201cStreet Name\u201d\nIf your shares of iRobot common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in \u201cstreet name,\u201d your broker, bank or other\nnominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for\ntheir customers to provide voting instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction\nform.\nIn accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of\ncommon stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposal to approve\nand adopt the merger agreement, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or other nominees do not\nreceive specific voting instructions with respect to these proposals from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares with\nrespect to these proposals. Therefore, unless you virtually attend the special meeting with a properly executed legal proxy from your broker, bank or\nother nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will result in your shares of iRobot common stock not\nbeing deemed present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and not being voted on any of the proposal to\napprove and adopt the merger agreement, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. However, if a beneficial owner of shares held in\nstreet name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives no instruction as\nto one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the special meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the\nspecial meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to\nany other proposal. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.\nRevocation of Proxies\nAny person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time before it is voted. If you are a\nstockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting by:\n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy dated after the date of the proxy being revoked, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission\nprocedures described above, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company, in each case, in\naccordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nvirtually attending the special meeting and voting by virtual ballot\u037e or\n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation dated after the date of the proxy being revoked by mail to the Company at iRobot Corporation,\n8 Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: Secretary in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card.\nPlease note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Virtually attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions\ndescribed above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company\nor by sending a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation\nin sufficient time for it to be received by the Company before the special meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by\nyour broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new voting instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you\nmay also revoke a prior proxy by voting virtually at the special meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other\nnominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the special meeting.\n4\nTable of Contents\nAbstentions",

If a quorum is\nnot present at the special meeting, the special meeting may, and at the request of Amazon.com, will, be adjourned or postponed from time to time by\nthe presiding officer (subject to the terms of the merger agreement and the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-Laws) until a quorum is obtained.\nAs of the close of business on September 2, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, there were 27,233,499 shares of common stock\noutstanding.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIf you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares will be counted\nfor the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and do not give any\ninstruction to your broker, bank or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the special meeting, those shares will not be entitled to\nvote on any proposal at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum.\nQ:\nWhat vote of iRobot stockholders is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement?\nA:\nApproval and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the close\nof business on the record date for the special meeting. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or an abstention from voting will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your\nbroker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, the failure to instruct your nominee will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.\nQ:\nWhat vote of iRobot stockholders is required to approve the remaining proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting?\nA:\nEach of the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly cast for and\nagainst such proposal, assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting.\nAn abstention with respect to either proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other\nnominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have no effect on these proposals (assuming that a quorum is present).\nThe approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal are not conditions to the\ncompletion of the merger.\nQ:\nHow does the iRobot board of directors recommend that I vote?\nA:\nThe iRobot board of directors unanimously recommends that iRobot stockholders vote:\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the iRobot board of directors considered in determining to recommend the approval and adoption of the merger\nagreement, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the iRobot Board of\nDirectors.\u201d In addition, in considering the recommendation of the iRobot board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be\naware that some of our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company\nstockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Interests of the Company\u2019s\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nHow do iRobot\u2019s directors and officers intend to vote?\nA:\nWe currently expect that the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the\nmerger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.\n19\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhen is the merger expected to be completed?\nA:\nWe are working toward completing the merger as promptly as possible, but as of the date of this proxy statement we cannot accurately estimate the\nclosing date of the merger because the merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of the conditions\nto Amazon.com, Merger Sub and the Company\u2019s respective obligations to consummate the merger, some of which are not within the parties\u2019\ncontrol. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger, and it is possible that the merger\nwill not be completed at all. After the requisite company vote is obtained, the iRobot board of directors will not have the right to terminate the\nmerger agreement in order to accept any alternative acquisition proposal. We expect to complete the merger promptly after the requisite company\nvote is obtained and all required regulatory clearances have been received.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by the Company\u2019s stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will\nremain a public company, and shares of our common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on\nNASDAQ. In the event that either iRobot or Amazon.com terminates the merger agreement, then, in certain specified circumstances, iRobot may be\nrequired to pay Amazon.com a termination fee in an amount equal to $56 million. Furthermore, if the merger agreement is terminated by either iRobot\nor Amazon.com because the requisite company vote has not been obtained or the outside date lapses without stockholders having approved the\nmerger agreement, iRobot will be required to pay to Amazon.com all of the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by\nAmazon.com and Merger Sub in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions in an amount not to exceed $17 million (which amount\nwill be deducted from the amount of any termination fee owed or payable by the Company). See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2014\nTermination Fees\u037e Expense Reimbursement.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?\nA:\nWe urge you to, and you should, read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference in\nthis proxy statement, and to consider how the merger affects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock you\nown.\nVoting Virtually\nStockholders of record will be able to vote virtually at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of\ncommon stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or\nother nominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the special meeting.\nIt is not necessary to virtually attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the\nspecial meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting virtually.\nAttending the meeting virtually does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder\nYou can also ensure that your shares are voted at the special meeting by submitting your proxy via:\n\u2022\nmail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope\u037e\n20\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\ntelephone, by calling the telephone number indicated on your proxy card or voting instruction form and follow the easy prompts\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe Internet, by accessing the voting site indicated on the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form and follow the simple instructions.\nIf you had earlier consented to receiving proxy materials by email, you may simply click the \u201cVOTE NOW\u201d button in the accompanying\nemail.\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote with respect to a proposal, your proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d\n(1) the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, (2) the compensation proposal, and (3) the adjournment proposal.\nWe encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on virtually attending the special meeting.\nA failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. A\nfailure to vote or an abstention will have no effect on the other two proposals (assuming that a quorum is present).\nShares of Common Stock Held in \u201cStreet Name\u201d\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your broker, bank\nor other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Because brokers, banks and other nominees do not\nhave discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting, without your instructions, your shares\nheld in street name will not be present or represented by proxy at the special meeting, will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum\nis present at the special meeting, and will not be voted on any of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. However, if a beneficial owner of\nshares held in street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives no\ninstruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the special meeting for purposes of establishing a\nquorum at the special meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with\nrespect to any other proposal. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.\nQ:\nCan I revoke my proxy?\nA:\nYes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your\nproxy by notifying the Company at iRobot Corporation, 8 Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: Secretary, or by submitting a new proxy by\ntelephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card and dated after the date of the proxy\nbeing revoked. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by virtually attending the special meeting and voting virtually\u037e however, simply attending\nthe special meeting virtually will not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you have\ninstructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should instead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other\nnominee to revoke your prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting virtually at\nthe special meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the\nspecial meeting.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?\nA:\nThe requisite number of shares to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement is based on the total number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding on the record date, not just the shares that are\n21\nTable of Contents\nvoted. If you do not vote, or abstain from voting, on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, it will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other\nnominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, your nominee may not vote your shares on the proposal to approve and\nadopt the merger agreement.\nThe requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of votes properly cast for and against those\nproposals, assuming a quorum is present. If you do not vote or abstain from voting, it will have no effect on the compensation proposal and the\nadjournment proposal (assuming that a quorum is present).\nQ:\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal?\nA:\nThe inclusion of this proposal is required by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d)\u037e however, the approval of this\nproposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger. In addition, the vote on this proposal is an advisory vote by stockholders and will not\nbe binding on the Company or Amazon.com. If the merger agreement is approved and adopted by the Company\u2019s stockholders and the merger is\ncompleted, the merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company\u2019s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their\ncompensation agreements and arrangements even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder\nof record.\u201d In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by iRobot.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of shares of common stock held in\n\u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect\nto those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to\nvote your shares by following their instructions for voting. Because of the non-routine nature of the proposals to be voted on at the special\nmeeting, your broker, bank or other nominee is not authorized to vote your shares on any proposal without instructions from you. You are also\ninvited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting\nunless you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, as the stockholder of record, authorizing you to vote your shares.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the special\nmeeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you\nvoted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the other two proposals (assuming that a\nquorum is present).\nQ:\nWill my shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold\nof record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares of common stock you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder (that is, your\ncustodial bank, broker or other financial nominee) than any shares of\n22\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock you hold of record, any shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of\ncommon stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares of common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as\ntrustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of common\nstock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be\nvoted by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card. Shares of common stock\nheld in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account. This means that, to ensure all your shares are voted\nat the special meeting, you should read carefully any proxy materials received and follow the instructions included therewith.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?\nA:\nIf your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy or voting\ninstruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by\ntelephone or the Internet) to ensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the merger?\nA:\nIn order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the merger. Consequently, if you\ntransfer your shares of common stock before completion of the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in\nthe merger.\nThe record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the completion of the merger. If you transfer your shares of\ncommon stock after the record date but before the closing of the merger, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made\nbetween you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies iRobot in writing of such special\narrangements, you will have the right to vote at the special meeting but not the right to receive the merger consideration. You will also lose the\nability to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger with respect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your\nshares of common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply\nenvelope or grant your proxy electronically or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nA:\nNo. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed\nwritten instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration. If your shares of\ncommon stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other\nnominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the merger consideration.\nDo not send in your stock certificates now.\nQ:\nMay I exercise dissenters\u2019 rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the merger?\nA:\nYes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, iRobot\nstockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger and otherwise comply with, and do not validly withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights\nunder, the applicable provisions of Delaware law will be entitled to appraisal rights to receive, in cash, the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares as determined\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery if the merger is completed. Appraisal rights will only be available to iRobot stockholders who properly deliver,\nand do not properly withdraw, a written\n23\nTable of Contents\ndemand for an appraisal to iRobot prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and who comply with,\nand do not otherwise lose their appraisal rights under, the other procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are\nsummarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a iRobot stockholder would be\nentitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights of iRobot\nStockholders.\u201d Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262).\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary\ninstructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder\ncontinues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial\nowners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received\nhouseholding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy\nstatement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may\ndecide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written document describing the matters to be\nconsidered and voted on at the special meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of\ncommon stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way\nthat you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for\nor against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nIf available, iRobot may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. iRobot intends to publish final voting results\nin a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that iRobot files with the SEC are publicly\navailable when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWhere can I find more information about iRobot?\nA:\nYou can find more information about the Company from various sources described in the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional\nInformation.\u201d\nQ:\nWho can help answer my other questions?\nA:\nIf you have more questions about the merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of the\nproxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Innisfree\n24\nTable of Contents\nM&A Incorporated (\u201cInnisfree\u201d), which is acting as the proxy solicitation agent and information agent for the Company in connection with the\nmerger, at the telephone numbers or address below.\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, NY 10022\nStockholders May Call:\n1 (877) 750-8332 (TOLL-FREE from the U.S. and Canada)\nor\n+1 (412) 232-3651 (From other countries)\nIf your broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares, you should also call your broker, bank or other nominee for additional information.\n25\nTable of Contents\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",

This proxy statement provides the Company\u2019s stockholders with the\ninformation they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.\nDate, Time and Place of the Special Meeting\nThis proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the iRobot board of directors for use at the\nspecial meeting to be held virtually on October 17, 2022, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, via live audio webcast on the Internet at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/IRBT2022SM, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. The Company will hold the special meeting virtually\nvia the Internet at the virtual meeting website. You will not be able to attend the special meeting physically in person.\nFor information regarding attending the meeting, please see \u201cThe Special Meeting \u2014 Voting\u037e Proxies\u037e Revocation \u2014 Attendance.\u201d\nPurposes of the Special Meeting\nAt the special meeting, iRobot stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\n\u2022\nto approve and adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nto approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation proposal, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of\nthis proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d\u037e and\n\u2022\nto approve the adjournment proposal.\nOur stockholders must approve and adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to approve and adopt the merger\nagreement, the merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, and the material provisions of the\nmerger agreement are described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d\nThe vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve and adopt the\nmerger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve the executive compensation and vote not to approve and adopt the merger agreement\nand vice versa. Because the vote on executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Amazon.com.\nAccordingly, if the merger agreement is approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be\npaid to the Company\u2019s executive officers even if the stockholders fail to approve the proposal.\niRobot does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and only the\nmatters specified in the notice of the special meeting may be considered or acted upon at the special meeting.\nThis proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our stockholders on or about September 7, 2022, and the mailing is\nexpected to be completed on or about September 14, 2022.\nRecord Date and Quorum\nThe holders of record of iRobot common stock as of the close of business on September 2, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled\nto receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 27,233,499 shares of common stock were outstanding.\n29Table of Contents\nA majority of the shares entitled to vote, present virtually or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the special meeting. Once a share is\nrepresented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting. However, if a new record date is set\nfor an adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included in the\ncalculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and do not give any\ninstruction to your broker, bank or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the special meeting, those shares will not be entitled to vote\non any proposal at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum.\nRequired Vote\nEach share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of the proposals to be\nconsidered at the special meeting.\nFor the Company to complete the merger, iRobot stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the close of\nbusiness on the record date must vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or\nan abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.\nApproval of each of the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly cast\nfor and against such proposal, assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting. An abstention with respect to either proposal, or a failure to vote\nyour shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have no effect on these\nproposals (assuming that a quorum is present).\nVoting by the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\nAt the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of the Company were entitled to vote approximately 398,481 shares of\ncommon stock, or approximately 1.46% of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding on that date. We currently expect that the Company\u2019s\ndirectors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be\nconsidered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.\nVoting\u037e Proxies\u037e Revocation\nAttendance\nAll holders of shares of common stock as of the close of business on September 2, 2022, the record date, including stockholders of record and\nbeneficial owners of common stock registered in the \u201cstreet name\u201d of a broker, bank or other nominee, are invited virtually to attend the special meeting.\nTo attend the special meeting virtually, you must provide proof of ownership of iRobot common stock as of the close of business on the record\ndate. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and you also wish to be able to vote virtually at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in\nyour favor, from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nVoting Virtually\nIf you plan to virtually attend the special meeting and wish to vote virtually, you will be given a virtual ballot at the special meeting. If you are not a\nstockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are encouraged to\nvote by proxy even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting. If you virtually attend the special meeting and vote by virtual ballot, your vote will\nrevoke any previously submitted proxy.\n30\nTable of Contents\nProviding Voting Instructions by Proxy\nTo ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by\nproxy, even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting.\nShares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described below.\nSubmit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting voting\ninstructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet address specified on the enclosed\nproxy card. Your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy\ncard, as described below.\nSubmit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the special meeting,\nyour shares of common stock will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of the proposal to\napprove and adopt the merger agreement, the compensation proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named\nexecutive officers of the Company in connection with the merger and the proposal to adjourn from time to time the special meeting, if necessary or\nappropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve and\nadopt the merger agreement. If you fail to return your proxy card and you are a holder of record on the record date, unless you virtually attend the special\nmeeting and vote virtually, the effect will be that your shares of common stock will not be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of\ndetermining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the\nmerger agreement and, assuming a quorum is present, will not affect the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held in \u201cStreet Name\u201d\nIf your shares of common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in \u201cstreet name,\u201d your broker, bank or other nominee will\nsend you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to\nprovide voting instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.\nIn accordance with the rules of NASDAQ, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d for their\ncustomers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the\ncompensation proposal or the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or\nother nominees do not receive specific voting instructions with respect to these proposals from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote\nsuch shares with respect to these proposals. Therefore, unless you virtually attend the special meeting with a properly executed legal proxy from your\nbroker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will result in your shares of iRobot common\nstock not being deemed present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and not being voted on any of the\nproposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. However, if a beneficial owner of shares\nheld in street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but\n31\nTable of Contents\ngives no instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the special meeting for purposes of\nestablishing a quorum at the special meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be\nvoted with respect to any other proposal. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your\nshares.\nRevocation of Proxies\nAny person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time before it is voted. If you are a\nstockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting by:\n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy dated after the date of the proxy being revoked, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures\ndescribed above, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company, in each case, in accordance with\nthe instructions on the enclosed proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nvirtually attending the special meeting and voting by virtual ballot\u037e or\n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation dated after the date of the proxy being revoked by mail to the Company at iRobot Corporation, 8\nCrosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: Secretary in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card.\nPlease note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Virtually attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions described\nabove will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by sending a\nwritten notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it\nto be received by the Company before the special meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by your\nbroker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new voting instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may also\nrevoke a prior proxy by voting virtually at the special meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in\norder to be able to vote virtually at the special meeting.\nAbstentions\nAn abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either virtually or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting. Abstentions will be\nincluded in the calculation of the number of shares of common stock present or represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a\nquorum has been achieved.\nAbstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Assuming a\nquorum is present at the special meeting, the requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of votes\nproperly cast for and against those proposals. If you abstain from voting and a quorum is present at the special meeting, it will have no effect on the\ncompensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.",

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of iRobot\u2019s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the iRobot board of directors and management\nof iRobot (\u201ciRobot management\u201d or \u201cCompany management\u201d) periodically review, consider and assess iRobot\u2019s operations and financial performance, as\nwell as overall industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals and plans, with the goal of enhancing\nshareholder value. This review at times includes, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations,\nacquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives.\nDuring the first and second quarters of 2022, the iRobot board of directors and iRobot management actively assessed rapidly evolving industry,\nglobal and regional macroeconomic trends and geopolitical dynamics, intensifying competitive conditions and inflationary price pressures relevant to\niRobot\u2019s business, performance and long-term prospects.\nAmazon.com had previously approached iRobot in November 2016 to propose an acquisition of iRobot at $60.50 per share. In response, iRobot had\nengaged an outside financial advisor to help the iRobot board of directors in its consideration of that offer. The iRobot board of directors\u2019 work with its\nfinancial advisor at the time, combined with other relevant factors considered by the iRobot board of directors, resulted in iRobot informing Amazon.com\nthat its offer undervalued iRobot. In the subsequent months, iRobot\u2019s trading price increased materially, and Amazon.com discontinued its engagement\nwith respect to a potential acquisition of iRobot. Since that time, iRobot management continued to engage approximately once per year with Amazon.com\nrepresentatives on matters unrelated to a potential mergers and acquisitions (\u201cM&A\u201d) transaction.\nAs part of iRobot\u2019s ordinary course business planning, at the direction of the iRobot board of directors, members of iRobot management in\nNovember and December 2021 had prepared a long-term business and strategy plan through fiscal year 2024 (the \u201cDecember 2021 business plan\u201d), which\nwas presented to the iRobot board of directors. A portion of the December 2021 business plan was shared with investors on December 9, 2021 during\niRobot\u2019s investor day.\nOn May 16, 2022, a representative of Amazon.com called Mr. Colin Angle, Chief Executive Officer of iRobot. On the call, Amazon.com expressed\ninterest in a potential transaction to acquire iRobot (such potential transaction involving iRobot and Amazon.com, the \u201cproposed transaction\u201d) and\nindicated that Amazon.com could move expeditiously in its due diligence and the negotiation of definitive documentation for the proposed transaction.\nOn the call, Mr. Angle did not indicate whether iRobot was interested in the proposed transaction and made no commitment as to any next steps,\nincluding whether to permit Amazon.com to enter into a non-disclosure agreement and gain access to confidential due diligence information regarding\niRobot. Following the call, Mr. Angle gave an update regarding the call to certain members of the iRobot board of directors.\nOn May 23, 2022, with the permission of the members of the iRobot board of directors with whom Mr. Angle spoke, iRobot entered into a\nsupplement to its existing non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.com. This supplement contained customary \u201cstandstill\u201d provisions binding on\nAmazon.com, and provided that such standstill provisions would automatically terminate in the event that certain change of control events relating to\niRobot occurred.\n35Table of Contents\nOn May 25, 2022, members of iRobot management met with members of Amazon.com management to discuss high-level due diligence matters in\nconnection with the proposed transaction. On the call, iRobot responded to questions that Amazon.com raised regarding iRobot\u2019s publicly disclosed\nfirst-quarter 2022 financial results and full-year 2022 guidance range. iRobot conveyed to Amazon.com that the December 2021 business plan was\nproduced as of December 2021 and had not been updated subsequently for changes in Company, industry and macroeconomic and geopolitical\nconditions. In addition, iRobot conveyed that given those changes and as a result of iRobot\u2019s updated view of currently anticipated second-quarter 2022\nfinancial performance, iRobot would likely be in the low end of the full-year 2022 guidance range provided to investors on May 4, 2022.\nOn May 26, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management also in attendance. Representatives of\nGoodwin Procter LLP, iRobot\u2019s outside counsel (\u201cGoodwin\u201d), attended portions of the meeting. Prior to the meeting, iRobot had shared with members of\niRobot management certain management guidelines which, among other things, directed management not to have any discussions regarding post-closing\nemployment with Amazon.com until and unless approved and authorized by the iRobot board of directors or a committee thereof. At the meeting, iRobot\nmanagement presented to the iRobot board of directors a comprehensive status update regarding the proposed transaction including the recent\ninteractions with Amazon.com. The iRobot board of directors also discussed interviews that members of iRobot management had conducted with\nrepresentatives of five investment banks with the iRobot board of directors\u2019 permission, including Qatalyst Partners LP (\u201cQatalyst Partners\u201d), in\nconnection with advising iRobot with respect to a potential strategic transaction. The iRobot board of directors then discussed the formal engagement of\nQatalyst Partners as its financial advisor in connection with its review of potential strategic opportunities, including the proposed transaction, noting\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 experience opposite Amazon.com as well as Qatalyst Partners\u2019 extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which iRobot operates\nand experience advising technology companies in connection with potential strategic transactions. On the basis of these considerations, and subject in\nall respects to the iRobot board of directors\u2019 review of a customary relationships disclosure to be produced by Qatalyst Partners (which disclosure was\nproduced by Qatalyst Partners on June 8, 2022 and was promptly shared with the transaction committee (as defined below) and the iRobot board of\ndirectors), the iRobot board of directors authorized iRobot management to negotiate terms of an engagement letter for the purpose of engaging Qatalyst\nPartners. Representatives of Goodwin also discussed the iRobot board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in connection with the evaluation of a potential\nstrategic transaction involving iRobot, whether with Amazon.com or any other counterparty. The iRobot board of directors also discussed that it would\nneed to evaluate iRobot\u2019s long-range plan and projections, the current value of iRobot and available strategic opportunities before determining how to\nrespond to Amazon.com\u2019s outreach. Accordingly, the iRobot board of directors authorized management to develop a set of long-range plans and\nprojections (an \u201cLRP\u201d) for the period from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2027. The directors were then invited to disclose any actual or potential conflicts\nof interest they may have in relation to Amazon.com and its affiliates. Ms. Eva Manolis disclosed a prior business relationship with Amazon.com in\naddition to ownership of Amazon.com stock that is material to her personal net worth\u037e the iRobot board of directors determined that, as such business\nrelationship was not recent and such business relationship and ownership of Amazon.com stock were disclosed to the iRobot board of directors, Ms.\nManolis would not be required to recuse herself with respect to the proposed transaction. Certain other directors also disclosed ownership of\nAmazon.com stock that was not material to their respective personal net worth. The iRobot board of directors also discussed adopting resolutions\nforming a transaction committee of the iRobot board of directors (the \u201ctransaction committee\u201d) to consider, review and evaluate any proposals made for a\npotential transaction with any counterparty as well as any alternatives to a potential strategic transaction, including, without limitation, iRobot continuing\nto operate as an independent, publicly traded company. The iRobot board of directors discussed that the transaction committee was being formed for\nexpediency of process, and not in response to any actual or potential conflict of interest concerns in relation to Amazon.com and its affiliates. The iRobot\nboard of directors also discussed its belief that it would be beneficial and in the best interests of stockholders for Mr. Angle to participate on the\ntransaction committee due to, among other reasons, his transactional skill and experience and his extensive knowledge of iRobot and the industry in\nwhich it operates. The iRobot board of directors then adopted resolutions forming the transaction committee, and\n36\nTable of Contents\nappointed Mr. Andrew Miller, an independent director, Ms. Michelle Stacy, an independent director, and Mr. Angle to the transaction committee.\nPromptly following this meeting, Mr. Miller, Ms. Stacy and Mr. Angle each answered written questions regarding their relationships, which confirmed that\neach was independent and disinterested in relation to Amazon.com and its affiliates. At the meeting, the iRobot board of directors also determined to\nrevisit the composition of the transaction committee in the event that iRobot engaged with any other counterparty with respect to which any of the\nincumbent members of the transaction committee were not independent or disinterested. Finally, at the meeting, the iRobot board of directors authorized\niRobot management to continue to engage in high-level due diligence with Amazon.com in relation to the proposed transaction.\nOn June 1, 2022, members of iRobot management again met with members of Amazon.com management to further discuss high-level due diligence\nmatters in relation to the proposed transaction.\nOn June 6, 2022, Mr. Glen Weinstein, Chief Legal Officer of iRobot, spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, and during this discussion, the\nAmazon.com representative indicated that Amazon.com was leaning toward making a non-binding proposal based on the information they had received\nthus far in due diligence, and that Amazon.com would be able to provide an updated view by the end of that week.\nOn June 8, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee discussed strategy around its expectation that Amazon.com would make a non-binding proposal\nsometime that week, including the transaction committee\u2019s desire for Amazon.com to propose a set of terms related to regulatory matters as part of that\nproposal. The transaction committee also discussed general market dynamics and the regulatory landscape in connection with the proposed transaction.\nThe transaction committee then discussed a plan for the timing, scope and sequencing for a potential pre-signing market check. The transaction\ncommittee discussed with the representatives of Qatalyst Partners whether any potential acquirors other than Amazon.com would be likely to submit a\nproposal to acquire iRobot that would be superior to a proposal submitted by Amazon.com from a financial point of view, as well as execution and\nregulatory considerations, leak risk, competitive sensitivities and other relevant factors with respect to any such potential acquirors (including\nheightened national security-related execution risk with respect to certain potential non-U.S. acquirors that could make consummation of a transaction\nwith such potential non-U.S. acquirors challenging). Following such discussion, and taking into account these factors and the input provided by\nQatalyst Partners, the transaction committee determined to reach out to one additional potential acquiror, rather than conduct a broader outreach. The\ntransaction committee also noted that the iRobot board of directors would have the ability to consider superior proposals to acquire iRobot post-signing\nof any definitive agreement with Amazon.com through a customary \u201cfiduciary out.\u201d Participants in the meeting also expressed their belief that, among\npossible bidders for iRobot, a transaction with Amazon.com would present the most compelling strategic rationale, and discussed Amazon.com\u2019s strong\nindication that it was prepared to terminate engagement with iRobot if any leak were to occur with respect to the process. The transaction committee\ndetermined to reach out to the specific strategic counterparty (\u201cCompany A\u201d) as part of a market check process, but in light of the expected imminency of\nAmazon.com\u2019s initial proposal, the transaction committee determined not to make this outreach until after such initial proposal from Amazon.com was\nreceived.\nOn June 9, 2022, Mr. Weinstein spoke with a representative of Amazon.com. In accordance with the direction of the transaction committee, Mr.\nWeinstein conveyed the transaction committee\u2019s desire that any non-binding proposal from Amazon.com should include a set of terms related to\nregulatory matters. Amazon.com also reaffirmed that satisfactory progress on due diligence was being made and that it was continuing to lean toward\nmaking a non-binding proposal in the near term.\nOn June 10, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors at its May 26, 2022 meeting, iRobot entered into an engagement\nletter with Qatalyst Partners formalizing the engagement of Qatalyst Partners to act as iRobot\u2019s financial advisor to, among other things, assist iRobot in\nevaluating potential strategic opportunities, including the proposed transaction.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOn June 17, 2022, Mr. Weinstein spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, who indicated that a non-binding proposal for the acquisition of\niRobot would be submitted to iRobot by Amazon.com the following week.\nOn June 23, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, who verbally communicated to Mr. Angle a non-binding proposal for\nAmazon.com to acquire iRobot for $64.00 per share in cash. Mr. Angle did not respond to this proposal during the call. Later on June 23, 2022, iRobot\nreceived a formal non-binding letter of intent from Amazon.com to acquire iRobot for $64.00 per share in cash (the \u201cJune 23 proposal\u201d). The $64.00 per\nshare offer price implied a premium to iRobot\u2019s last closing price prior to June 23, 2022 of approximately 51%. The June 23 proposal did not propose any\nterms related to regulatory matters as had been requested by iRobot. The June 23 proposal stated that Amazon.com reserved the right to immediately\nterminate engagement with iRobot regarding a potential transaction if any leak occurred with respect to the process, and that the proposal was not\nsubject to any financing condition. The June 23 proposal did not include any request for exclusivity. The June 23 proposal was promptly shared with the\niRobot board of directors.\nLater on June 23, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee directed management to finalize the LRP and, subject to iRobot board of directors or transaction\ncommittee review and approval, provide the finalized LRP to Qatalyst Partners for purposes of providing financial analyses in connection with the iRobot\nboard of directors\u2019 and the transaction committee\u2019s evaluation of any potential strategic transaction, including the proposed transaction. The transaction\ncommittee also further discussed a potential pre-signing market check and determined and directed Qatalyst Partners, now that Amazon.com\u2019s initial\nproposal had been received, to reach out to Company A as part of the market check. The transaction committee then discussed with the advisors its belief\nthat Amazon.com\u2019s proposal constituted at least a credible initial offer at a significant premium to iRobot\u2019s current trading price. The transaction\ncommittee discussed the recent trading price of iRobot\u2019s stock and factors that may be affecting its trading price, and the execution risk and headwinds\nthat iRobot expected to face in executing its standalone plan moving forward.\nLater on June 23, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the transaction committee, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reached out to a\nrepresentative of Company A, and the representatives of Qatalyst Partners followed up with the same representative of Company A the next day on June\n24, 2022.\nOn June 29, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The members of iRobot management presented their current draft of the LRP for the period from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year\n2027 as of June 27, 2022 (the \u201cCompany LRP\u201d). The members of iRobot management underscored in their presentation that in the latter half of the second\nquarter of fiscal year 2022, recessionary pressures had escalated in EMEA and had begun to disrupt the U.S. market more than expected, and noted their\nexpectation that iRobot\u2019s actual financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, once finalized, would fall significantly below the low end\nof the publicly announced guidance range for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and would cause full-year 2022 performance to fall significantly\nbelow the low end of the publicly announced guidance range for fiscal year 2022 (collectively, the \u201cQ2 earnings miss\u201d). The members of iRobot\nmanagement stated that they remained cautious and uncertain about the speed and nature of market recovery and iRobot\u2019s own performance in coming\nyears in light of these conditions. As a result of these operational and macroeconomic uncertainties, in connection with the preparation of the Company\nLRP, iRobot management prepared certain sensitivity scenarios with respect to the Company LRP that reflected stronger and weaker Company\nperformance for the projected period based on the assumed pace of market recovery from recent industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In\npresenting the Company LRP to the iRobot board of directors on June 29, 2022, members of iRobot management indicated that these separate scenarios\nwere being provided to the iRobot board of directors for informational purposes, that the iRobot board of directors was not being asked to, and would\nnot be asked to, approve any of these separate scenarios and that these separate scenarios remained subject to change, as management was still actively\nnot be asked to, approve any of these separate scenarios and that these separate scenarios remained subject to change, as management was still actively\nfinalizing its review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance. Following discussion, the iRobot board of directors approved\nthe Company LRP and directed Qatalyst Partners to use and rely on the Company LRP for purposes of providing financial analyses in connection\n38\nTable of Contents\nwith the iRobot board of directors\u2019 evaluation of any potential strategic transaction, including the proposed transaction. Qatalyst Partners then reviewed\nthe June 23 proposal from a financial point of view in light of the Company LRP. The iRobot board of directors also asked management to update the\nmarket recovery scenarios based on management\u2019s finalization of its assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance and, upon\ncompletion of any such updates, to share related financial information with Amazon.com in connection with Amazon.com\u2019s business and financial due\ndiligence. Goodwin also presented a proposed set of certain non-price terms with respect to which iRobot could potentially initiate negotiations over\nregulatory matters, which included (among other things) (a) a reverse termination fee, (b) an obligation to litigate on the merits in the event that a\nregulatory agency were to seek to enjoin the proposed transaction, (c) a \u201cclear skies\u201d covenant prohibiting Amazon.com from engaging in other M&A\ntransactions that would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede the obtaining of antitrust clearance for the proposed transaction and (d) an\noutside date of up to 18 months (on an as-extended basis). Finally, the iRobot board of directors discussed tactical considerations relating to iRobot\u2019s\npotential response to Amazon.com\u2019s June 23 proposal. The iRobot board of directors (a) directed Qatalyst Partners to respond to Amazon.com (i) with a\nspecific price counterproposal of $70.00 per share, (ii) reiterating the iRobot board of directors\u2019 expectation that the parties agree upon a set of terms\nrelated to regulatory matters prior to negotiating the details of definitive transaction documentation and (iii) previewing iRobot\u2019s Q2 earnings miss and\nsharing certain financial information in that regard and (b) directed Goodwin to propose the set of certain non-price terms to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,\nWharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d), Amazon.com\u2019s outside counsel.\nLater on June 29, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reached out to\nrepresentatives of Amazon.com and conveyed the counterproposal of $70.00 per share, and reiterated the iRobot board of directors\u2019 expectation that the\nparties agree upon a set of terms related to regulatory matters prior to negotiating the details of definitive transaction documents. The representatives of\nQatalyst Partners also previewed iRobot\u2019s Q2 earnings miss to the representatives of Amazon.com and indicated that iRobot would likely not meet the\nlow end of its full-year 2022 guidance range, and shared certain financial information in that regard. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners also\ndiscussed with representatives of Amazon.com the parties\u2019 expectations with respect to transaction timing and Amazon.com\u2019s ability to move forward\nexpeditiously to negotiate and execute a definitive agreement in respect of the proposed transaction. The representatives of Amazon.com reiterated that\nAmazon.com was capable of moving expeditiously to a signing of a definitive agreement, but that it had little room to move on deal price, and that the\nAmazon.com representatives would require a call with representatives of iRobot to better understand the Q2 earnings miss prior to responding to the\npoints conveyed by the representatives of Qatalyst Partners.\nOn June 30, 2022, representatives of iRobot spoke with representatives of Amazon.com to discuss the Q2 earnings miss. As a result of iRobot\nmanagement\u2019s continued review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance, on this call the representatives of iRobot presented\ninformation with respect to actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance. On the call, the representatives of Amazon.com conveyed that the Q2\nearnings miss, as well as the expectation that iRobot would likely not meet the low end of its full-year 2022 guidance, had been a surprise to them and that\nthey would require some time to evaluate.\nAlso on June 30, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with a representative of Company A, who conveyed that Company A was\nevaluating a potential transaction with iRobot but had not yet gained sufficient internal support to pursue a potential transaction and would therefore be\nunlikely to proceed further in discussions of a potential acquisition of iRobot.\nOn July 1, 2022, representatives of Amazon.com asked members of iRobot management follow-up questions related to iRobot\u2019s financial\nperformance stemming from the financial information provided on June 29 and June 30, 2022, to which members of iRobot management responded.\nOn July 2, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors, representatives of Goodwin proposed to Paul Weiss and\nAmazon.com\u2019s outside regulatory counsel the set of non-price terms related to regulatory matters that was previously presented to the iRobot board of\ndirectors at the June 29, 2022 meeting.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOn July 4, 2022, representatives of Amazon.com spoke with representatives of Qatalyst Partners, during which Amazon.com (i) reaffirmed its offer\nprice of $64.00 per share notwithstanding the Q2 earnings miss, predicated on the parties\u2019 entry into and announcement of a definitive agreement either\nprior to or concurrently with iRobot\u2019s earnings announcement for the second quarter 2022, it being understood that, standing alone, the public\nannouncement of the Q2 earnings miss would be expected to adversely impact iRobot\u2019s trading price, and (ii) provided Amazon.com\u2019s counterproposal\nwith respect to the set of certain non-price terms previously provided by iRobot, which counterproposal included (among other things) (a) an \u201cantitrust\u201d\n(and not explicitly a foreign investment law) reverse termination fee equal to 5% of iRobot\u2019s equity value, (b) an obligation to litigate on the merits in the\nevent that a regulatory agency were to seek to enjoin the transaction, (c) a \u201cclear skies\u201d covenant prohibiting Amazon.com from acquiring a specific list\nof companies during the pendency of a transaction and (d) an outside date of up to 24 months (on an as-extended basis) (the \u201cJuly 4 proposal\u201d). The\nreaffirmed $64.00 per share offer price implied a premium to iRobot\u2019s last closing price prior to July 4, 2022 of approximately 71%.\nAlso on July 4, 2022, in response to the July 4 proposal, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com and during this call Mr. Angle\nexpressed that he was personally not supportive of Amazon.com\u2019s $64.00 per share price proposal but could potentially support a deal price of $65.00 per\nshare, subject to input from the iRobot board of directors.\nLater on July 4, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee and its advisors discussed the developments described above since the June 29, 2022 iRobot\nboard of directors meeting, including the July 4 proposal. The transaction committee also discussed its view that the set of non-price terms related to\nregulatory matters proposed by Amazon.com as part of the July 4 proposal was favorable to iRobot and would be generally acceptable. The transaction\ncommittee resolved to recommend to the iRobot board of directors that iRobot continue to engage with Amazon.com and that, subject to continued\nevaluation by the iRobot board of directors in all respects, a transaction with Amazon.com entered into at a per share price of $64.00 or more, combined\nwith terms related to regulatory matters that are as proposed by Amazon.com or better, would be expected to constitute a transaction that is in the best\ninterests of iRobot and its stockholders.\nImmediately following this transaction committee meeting on July 4, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin also in attendance. The iRobot board of directors and its advisors discussed the\ndevelopments described above since the June 29, 2022 meeting of the iRobot board of directors, including the July 4 proposal. The iRobot board of\ndirectors also discussed the transaction committee\u2019s impression that the set of non-price terms related to regulatory matters proposed by Amazon.com as\npart of the July 4 proposal was favorable to iRobot and would be generally acceptable. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then conveyed to the iRobot\nboard of directors that Company A had indicated that it would be unlikely to proceed further in discussions of a potential acquisition of iRobot, and that\nit was accordingly Qatalyst Partners\u2019 expectation that no proposal would be forthcoming from Company A. Following the transaction committee\u2019s\nrecommendation to the iRobot board of directors of the same, the iRobot board of directors approved that iRobot continue to engage with Amazon.com\nand that, subject to continued evaluation by the iRobot board of directors in all respects, a transaction with Amazon.com entered into at a per share price\nof $64.00 or more, combined with terms related to regulatory matters that are as proposed by Amazon.com or better, would be expected to constitute a\ntransaction that is in the best interests of iRobot and its stockholders. The iRobot board of directors and its advisors then discussed with management\nthe specific terms of a counterproposal that iRobot would make to Amazon.com as part of such continuing negotiations, which the iRobot board of\ndirectors determined would consist of (i) a deal price of $65.00 per share, (ii) a reverse termination fee equal to 8% of iRobot\u2019s equity value and (iii) a more\nexpansive \u201cclear skies\u201d covenant that was not limited to a list of specific companies.\nOn July 5, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors, representatives of Goodwin reaffirmed to representatives of Paul\nWeiss that iRobot\u2019s counterproposal consisted of the three points described above.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOn July 6, 2022, members of iRobot management spoke with representatives of Amazon.com. During such discussion, Amazon.com (i) raised its\noffer price to $64.50 per share but characterized this price as its best and final offer, (ii) proposed a $100 million reverse termination fee, which was\nequivalent to approximately 5.4% of iRobot\u2019s equity value, and (iii) rejected iRobot\u2019s proposed expansion of the \u201cclear skies\u201d covenant, reverting to the\nconstruct of a list of specific companies (the \u201cJuly 6 proposal\u201d). The $64.50 per share offer price implied a premium to iRobot\u2019s last closing price prior to\nJuly 6, 2022 of approximately 63%. As the terms of the July 6 proposal were more favorable to iRobot than the terms that the iRobot board of directors\nfound acceptable at the July 4, 2022 iRobot board of directors meeting, later on July 6, 2022, Mr. Angle had a phone conversation with a representative of\nAmazon.com and conveyed iRobot\u2019s willingness to move forward with the proposed transaction on the basis of the July 6 proposal (including as to the\n$64.50 per share deal price), subject to final iRobot board of directors approval.\nLater on July 6, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with other of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The members of the transaction committee discussed the July 6 proposal. Following discussion with Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin, the members of the transaction committee noted that its view that iRobot had likely obtained the most favorable package of material deal terms\nthat could reasonably be obtained from Amazon.com. under the circumstances. The transaction committee approved that iRobot continue to engage with\nAmazon.com on the basis of the July 6 proposal, including with respect to due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement.\nIn accordance with this direction of the transaction committee, iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin\nproceeded to conduct multiple due diligence management sessions with representatives of Amazon.com from July 6, 2022 through July 18, 2022. iRobot\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin also continued to respond to Amazon.com\u2019s documentary due diligence requests\nuntil the parties\u2019 entry into the merger agreement on August 4, 2022.\nOn July 9, 2022, Paul Weiss sent to Goodwin Amazon.com\u2019s initial draft of a proposed merger agreement for the proposed transaction. Paul Weiss\nand Goodwin continued to negotiate and revise the merger agreement until the parties\u2019 entry into the merger agreement on August 4, 2022.\nOn July 13, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee discussed key legal issues reflected in Amazon.com\u2019s initial draft of the merger agreement\nreceived on July 9, 2022. The transaction committee also took note that the draft merger agreement indicated that Amazon.com would seek to have\ndiscussions with key executives of iRobot regarding post-closing employment with Amazon.com.\nAlso on July 13, 2022, in connection with the continued due diligence approved by the transaction committee on July 6, 2022, iRobot provided\nAmazon.com with a portion of the sensitivity scenario based on the Updated Company LRP (as defined and discussed below) that had been prepared by\niRobot management in early July 2022 and that reflected stronger Company performance assuming an accelerated pace of market recovery from recent\nindustry, macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility (the \u201caccelerated market recovery scenario\u201d), as compared to the assumptions reflected in the\nUpdated Company LRP.\nOn July 14, 2022, a representative of Amazon.com spoke with a representative of Qatalyst Partners. The call primarily covered due diligence\nlogistics, but the representative of Amazon.com also conveyed Amazon.com\u2019s view that the information presented in the accelerated market recovery\nscenario was below its expectations and that Amazon.com was still considering such information.\nOn July 18, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com in connection with Amazon.com\u2019s due diligence of the senior executive\nteam at iRobot. The call did not involve any discussion about post-closing compensatory or other employment arrangements.\nOn July 20, 2022, Ms. Julie Zeiler, Chief Financial Officer of iRobot, exchanged emails with a representative of Amazon.com. Ms. Zeiler reported that,\nas a result of iRobot management\u2019s continued review\n41\nTable of Contents\nand assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance, iRobot was projecting an additional shortfall in revenue and non-GAAP operating\nincome (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger \u2014Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d) for the second quarter 2022\nrelative to what was previously presented to Amazon.com.\nOn July 22, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, Amazon.com\u2019s financial advisor, spoke with representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express\nconcern about iRobot\u2019s financial performance and previewing that Amazon.com was evaluating a potential reduction in its offer price. Representatives of\nQatalyst Partners responded on these communications that a price reduction would be received very poorly by the iRobot board of directors.\nAlso on July 22, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, who conveyed that Amazon.com was reducing its offer price from\n$64.50 to $60.00 per share (the \u201cJuly 22 proposal\u201d). The $60.00 per share offer price implied a premium to iRobot\u2019s last closing price prior to July 22, 2022 of\napproximately 34%. The representative of Amazon.com also conveyed strongly that Amazon.com would not have any significant additional headroom on\nthe deal price.\nOn July 23, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee discussed the July 22 proposal. The transaction committee further discussed with Qatalyst\nPartners whether Amazon.com was genuinely prepared to terminate engagement with respect to the proposed transaction entirely or whether\nAmazon.com was simply seeking added leverage in negotiations with iRobot. The transaction committee reviewed with Qatalyst Partners potential\nimplications of another public M&A transaction recently announced by Amazon.com, as well as iRobot\u2019s revised second-quarter 2022 financial\nperformance. The transaction committee members generally opined that, while such recent developments were disappointing, the July 22 proposal would\nresult in a transaction that was still in the best interests of iRobot stockholders, especially in light of, among other things, iRobot\u2019s recent financial\nunderperformance and the market and execution risks associated with its standalone plan. The transaction committee members cited the highly uncertain\nindustry, macroeconomic and geopolitical landscapes over the coming years, and the uncertainty related to the timing of any market recovery. The\ntransaction committee determined to present this feedback to the iRobot board of directors at the meeting immediately following the July 23 transaction\ncommittee meeting.\nOn July 23, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The iRobot board of directors discussed the July 22 proposal. The iRobot board of directors further discussed with Qatalyst\nPartners whether Amazon.com was genuinely prepared to terminate engagement with respect to the proposed transaction entirely or whether\nAmazon.com was simply seeking added leverage in negotiations with iRobot. The iRobot board of directors reviewed with Qatalyst Partners potential\nimplications of another public M&A transaction recently announced by Amazon.com, as well as iRobot\u2019s revised second-quarter 2022 financial\nperformance. The transaction committee members provided their opinion that, while such recent developments were disappointing, the July 22 proposal\nwould result in a transaction that was still in the best interests of iRobot stockholders, especially in light of, among other things, iRobot\u2019s recent financial\nunderperformance and the execution risks associated with its standalone plan. The transaction committee members cited the highly uncertain industry,\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical landscapes over the coming years, and the uncertainty related to the timing of any market recovery. The iRobot board of\ndirectors generally agreed with the transaction committee\u2019s feedback on the July 22 proposal. As a result, the iRobot board of directors authorized\nmanagement to revert to (i) Amazon.com with a counterproposal of $61.00 per share and (ii) ultimately continue engagement with Amazon.com at a deal\nprice of at least $60.50 per share.\nLater on July 23, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com and relayed the counterproposal of $61.00 per share, and the\nrepresentative of Amazon.com conveyed that Amazon.com would agree to $61.00 per share as its best and final offer price. In accordance with the\ndirection of the iRobot board of\n42\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, Mr. Angle expressed iRobot\u2019s willingness to move forward at $61.00 per share as the final deal price for the proposed transaction and as a basis\nfor considering negotiation of the other material terms of the proposed transaction.\nOver the course of the ensuing period of time until the parties entered into the merger agreement on August 4, 2022, the parties finalized their\nnegotiation of the terms of the merger agreement and related ancillary documents pertaining to the proposed transaction, with the representatives of\nGoodwin and Paul Weiss continuing to exchange drafts of such documents, and Amazon.com concluded its due diligence process.\nSubsequent to the parties agreeing on valuation as a basis for moving forward, on July 25, 2022, a representative of Amazon.com requested that\nAmazon.com be permitted to initiate discussions with Mr. Angle regarding Mr. Angle\u2019s potential post-closing employment with Amazon.com and the\nterms thereof. Amazon.com stated that such discussions and agreement with respect to post-closing employment terms for Mr. Angle would be a\ncondition to signing a definitive agreement with respect to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Goodwin discussed this request with the\nmembers of the transaction committee other than Mr. Angle, and following such discussion, and in light of the parties having agreed on valuation and the\nnon-financial transaction terms as a basis for moving forward, these other members unanimously authorized Mr. Angle to have such discussions with\nAmazon.com, subject to Goodwin supervising such discussions on behalf of iRobot and Mr. Angle retaining his own legal counsel. Mr. Angle retained\nhis own legal counsel later on July 25, 2022, and over the course of the ensuing several days, Mr. Angle negotiated his post-closing compensatory\narrangements independently with Amazon.com and arrived at an agreement on such terms (see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cInterests of\nthe Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger \u2013 New Arrangements with iRobot Executive Officers\u201d). Prior to these developments and\nnegotiations commencing on July 25, 2022, under no circumstance did Mr. Angle discuss his potential post-closing employment with Amazon.com or the\nterms thereof with any representatives of Amazon.com.\nOn July 26, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with representatives of Goodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee\ndiscussed general status updates relating to the proposed transaction. Immediately after this transaction committee meeting, Mr. Miller and Ms. Stacy\nheld an executive session with representatives of Goodwin and discussed matters relating to Mr. Angle\u2019s post-closing employment with Amazon.com.\nOn July 28, 2022, members of iRobot management spoke with representatives of Amazon.com to discuss communications planning related to the\nproposed transaction. The parties agreed to target the public announcement of the proposed transaction on August 5, 2022, assuming that a definitive\nagreement was entered into on or prior to such date.\nOn July 31, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goodwin again informed the iRobot board of directors about the history of Amazon.com\u2019s discussions\nand eventual agreement with Mr. Angle regarding his post-closing compensatory arrangements. Representatives of Goodwin then presented the\nproposed final material legal terms in the definitive agreement and ancillary documents to be entered into with Amazon.com and reviewed with the\ndirectors their fiduciary duties. Members of iRobot management then presented an update to the Company LRP (the \u201cUpdated Company LRP\u201d) and the\nrelated sensitivity scenarios to the iRobot board of directors, which Updated Company LRP and related sensitivity scenarios had been updated following\nthe closing of iRobot\u2019s second fiscal quarter as a result of iRobot management\u2019s continued review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial\nperformance, based on additional information that first became available to iRobot management following the closing of the second quarter, and which\nupdate was explained to the iRobot board of directors. The Updated Company LRP principally reflected changes to iRobot\u2019s projected performance for\nthe second half of fiscal year 2022, and for fiscal years 2023 to 2027, iRobot\u2019s projected revenue, non-GAAP gross profit (as defined in the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger \u2014 Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d) and non-GAAP operating income remained unchanged, except\n43\nTable of Contents\nthat iRobot\u2019s projected adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) and unlevered free cash flow were modified\nslightly to reflect the most recent and updated view of iRobot management with respect to iRobot\u2019s long-term working capital and capital spend.\nMembers of iRobot management reiterated that, other than the Updated Company LRP, the updated sensitivity scenarios were being provided to the\niRobot board of directors for informational purposes, that the iRobot board of directors was not being asked to, and would not be asked to, approve any\nof these separate sensitivity scenarios. Following discussion by the iRobot board of directors, including regarding the execution risks associated with\niRobot\u2019s standalone plan and the uncertainty associated with the timing of the market recovery, the iRobot board of directors directed that Qatalyst\nPartners use and rely on the Updated Company LRP for purposes of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses in rendering its opinion with respect to the\nproposed transaction.\nOn August 4, 2022, the parties finalized the negotiation and drafting of the terms of the merger agreement and related ancillary documents\npertaining to the proposed transaction as well as Amazon.com\u2019s due diligence process, and the transaction committee held a meeting to review the final\nterms of the proposed definitive agreement between iRobot and Amazon.com and related ancillary documents and to vote on whether to recommend\nentry into such definitive agreement to the iRobot board of directors. Members of iRobot management and representatives of Goodwin and Qatalyst\nPartners also attended the meeting. The transaction committee discussed its reasons in favor of recommending the proposed transaction to the iRobot\nboard of directors, as well as considerations of risk pertaining to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then reviewed with the\ntransaction committee a summary form of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses with respect to the proposed transaction on the basis of the $61.00 deal\nprice and the Updated Company LRP, and noted that a more detailed summary would be provided to the full iRobot board of directors at the upcoming\niRobot board of directors meeting, and stated that Qatalyst Partners would be prepared to deliver its fairness opinion (on the basis of the $61.00 deal price\nand the Updated Company LRP) at such upcoming iRobot board of directors meeting. Representatives of Goodwin then reviewed with the transaction\ncommittee the employment discussions and agreement between Mr. Angle and Amazon.com, as well as the ownership of Amazon.com stock by certain\nmembers of the iRobot board of directors, as had previously been previewed with the iRobot board of directors. The transaction committee then adopted\nresolutions favorably recommending the proposed transaction with Amazon.com to the iRobot board of directors, except that Mr. Angle voluntarily\nrecused himself from this vote in light of his employment discussions with Amazon.com, in order to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest of the\ntransaction committee.\nImmediately following this transaction committee meeting on August 4, 2022, the iRobot board of directors met to review the final terms of the\nproposed definitive agreement between iRobot and Amazon.com and related ancillary documents and to vote on whether to approve entry into the\nproposed definitive agreement with Amazon.com. Members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin also attended\nthe meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the iRobot board of directors its financial analyses with respect to the proposed\ntransaction on the basis of the $61.00 deal price and the Updated Company LRP. Representatives of Goodwin then reminded the iRobot board of directors\nof the employment discussions and agreement between Mr. Angle and Amazon.com, as well as certain ownership of Amazon.com stock by certain\nmembers of the iRobot board of directors, as had previously been previewed with the iRobot board of directors. The iRobot board of directors (other than\nMr. Angle) unanimously approved participation by Mr. Angle and such other members of the iRobot board of directors in their discussions regarding,\nand their voting upon, the proposed transaction. Members of the transaction committee then presented the formal recommendation of the transaction\ncommittee with respect to the proposed transaction, including that it was the transaction committee\u2019s determination to favorably recommend that the\niRobot board of directors approve the proposed transaction. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the iRobot board of directors its\nfinancial analyses of the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon. At the conclusion of its\npresentation, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the iRobot board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of\nAugust 4, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the merger\nconsideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received\n44\nTable of Contents\npursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or\nany affiliate of Amazon.com), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion, please see\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP\u201d. After extensive discussions of the\nproposed transaction with Amazon.com and the matters summarized for the iRobot board of directors at the meeting, the iRobot board of directors then\nunanimously (i) determined that it was in the best interests of iRobot and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement\nwith Amazon.com, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement with Amazon.com and the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, and (iii) recommended that iRobot stockholders adopt the merger agreement with Amazon.com and directed that such\nmatter be submitted for consideration of iRobot stockholders at a special meeting of iRobot stockholders.\nLater in the evening on August 4, 2022, iRobot and Amazon.com executed and delivered the merger agreement.\nEarly in the morning on August 5, 2022, the parties issued a press release publicly announcing the proposed transaction.\nReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the iRobot Board of Directors",

Accordingly, on August 4, 2022, the iRobot board of directors\nunanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of iRobot approve and adopt the merger agreement.\nIn the course of reaching its recommendation, the iRobot board of directors met six times between May 26, 2022 and August 4, 2022, including, as\nneeded, with iRobot\u2019s independent legal and financial advisors, and considered the following material factors relating to the merger agreement and the\nmerger, each of which the iRobot board of directors believes supported its decision:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the $61.00 per share cash price provides stockholders with attractive value and liquidity and relative certainty for their shares of\nCompany common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of Company common stock, including the market performance of the common stock in light of\ncurrent industry, market and macroeconomic conditions, and the fact that the $61.00 per share cash price represents a premium of 48% to the\n30-day volume weighted average closing price as of August 4, 2022, and strong transaction multiple of 18.5x iRobot\u2019s estimated EBITDA for\nCY2023E based on the Updated Company LRP described in more detail in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Certain iRobot\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information\u037e\u201d\n\u2022\nthe belief that entering into the merger agreement with Amazon.com would be more favorable to Company stockholders on a risk-adjusted,\ntime-adjusted basis than the other alternatives reasonably available to the Company, including:\n\u2022\nthe continued operation of the Company on a standalone basis and the pursuit of other potential actionable strategic or financial\ntransactions, in light of the iRobot board of directors\u2019 assessment of the Company\u2019s business, assets and prospects, its competitive\nposition and historical and projected financial performance (as adjusted for the Company\u2019s actual performance in the second quarter\n2022).

The iRobot board of directors considered the oral opinion of\nQatalyst Partners, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 4, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various\nassumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in such written opinion, the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of\nCompany common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger\nagreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders. See \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP.\u201d\n47\nTable of Contents\nIn the course of reaching its recommendation, the iRobot board of directors also considered the risks and potentially negative factors relating to\nthe merger agreement and the merger, including:\n\u2022\nthe fact that Company stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in the Company following the merger, and therefore will cease\nto participate in the future earnings of growth that the Company may achieve, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock as a result of the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the transaction has a potential outside date as late as two years from the signing date, that stockholders could be asked to vote\non approval and adoption of the merger agreement well in advance of the completion of the transaction and that there is no interest payable\non the merger consideration or adjustment for inflation, and the purchase price is fixed regardless of any macroeconomic and/or tech sector\nrecovery during the pendency of the transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that, in light of the iRobot board of directors\u2019 determinations as to other strategic alternatives reasonably available to the Company,\nthe Company performed a \u201cmarket check\u201d prior to entry into the merger agreement with Amazon.com, which involved outreach to a strategic\nparty which did not result in any expression of interest, and that the merger agreement does not provide the Company with an opportunity\nto actively solicit alternative bids after entry into the merger agreement in accordance with a \u201cgo-shop\u201d mechanism\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the merger is not completed as a result of failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or the institution of regulatory\ninjunctions in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, or other reasons\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the reverse termination fee may be inadequate to compensate the Company for the damage caused by a termination of the\nmerger agreement and that, if available, other rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce and the success of which may\nbe uncertain\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk and costs of stockholder or third-party litigation relating to the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and costs to the Company if the merger is not completed\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential uncertainty about the likelihood, timing or effects of completion of the merger, including on the Company\u2019s stockholders,\nemployees, potential and existing customers and suppliers and other parties, and the risk that such uncertainty may impair the Company\u2019s\nability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and could cause third parties to seek to change or not enter into business relationships\nwith the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk of management distraction as a result of the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business before completion of the merger, generally requiring the Company to use\nreasonable best efforts to conduct its business in the ordinary course and prohibiting the Company from taking specified actions, which\nmay delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities, anticipated or not, that may arise\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the Company may be required to pay a termination fee of $56 million under certain circumstances or, if the merger\nagreement is terminated by either the Company or Amazon.com because Company stockholders do not approve the merger agreement or\nthe outside date lapses without stockholders having approved the merger agreement, to pay expenses incurred by Amazon.com and Merger\nSub in an amount not to exceed $17 million (which amount would be deducted from the amount of any termination fee owed or payable by\nthe Company)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the receipt of cash by Company stockholders in exchange for their shares of common stock will generally be a taxable\ntransaction to Company stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e and\n\u2022\nother risks and uncertainties of the nature identified in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and in\niRobot\u2019s filings with the SEC, including the risks set forth in\n48\nTable of Contents\n\u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in iRobot\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 2022 and iRobot\u2019s Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended April 2, 2022 and July 2, 2022. For more information, see section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nAfter taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the iRobot board of directors concluded that the risks, uncertainties,\nrestrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the merger agreement and transactions contemplated thereby were outweighed by the\npositive factors and potential benefits associated with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby that supported its determination\nand recommendation. Accordingly, the iRobot board of directors determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are\nadvisable and in the best interests of, iRobot and its stockholders.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the iRobot board of directors includes the material factors considered by\nthe iRobot board of directors but does not necessarily include all of the factors considered by the iRobot board of directors. The members of the iRobot\nboard of directors evaluated the various factors listed above, among other things, in light of their knowledge of the business, financial condition and\nprospects of iRobot and considered the advice of iRobot\u2019s independent financial and legal advisors. In view of the complexity and variety of factors\nconsidered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, the iRobot board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did\nnot, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in\nconsidering the information and reasons described above, individual members of the iRobot board of directors each applied his or her own personal\nbusiness judgment to the process and may have given different weights to different factors. The iRobot board of directors did not undertake to make any\nspecific determinations as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determinations. The\niRobot board of directors unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of iRobot approve the merger and the merger agreement based\nupon the totality of information it considered.\nWhen considering the foregoing recommendation of the iRobot board of directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement, stockholders should be aware that some of iRobot\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or\nin addition to, the interests of stockholders more generally. The iRobot board of directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other\nmatters, to the extent that they existed at the time, in reaching the determination that the merger agreement and the transactions were advisable and in the\nbest interests of iRobot and its stockholders, in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the\nmerger agreement and the consummation of the transactions, in making its recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement and approval of the transactions and in directing that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders.\nFor more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014 Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger.\u201d\nThe explanation of the reasons and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nCertain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information",

            "text": "Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\niRobot does not, in the ordinary course, make long-term projections as to future performance available to the public other than generally providing,\non a quarterly basis, estimated ranges of certain expected financial results and operational metrics for the current or pending fiscal year in its regular\nearnings press releases and other investor materials. However, in connection with evaluating a potential strategic transaction in June 2022, iRobot\nmanagement created the Company LRP, referred to in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cBackground of the Merger\u201d (the \u201cbackground\nsection\u201d). As a result of various operational and macroeconomic\n49Table of Contents\nuncertainties as more fully described in the background section, in connection with the preparation of the Company LRP, iRobot management prepared\ncertain sensitivity scenarios with respect to the Company LRP that reflected stronger and weaker Company performance for the projected period based on\nthe assumed pace of market recovery from recent industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In presenting the Company LRP to the iRobot board\nof directors in June 2022, members of iRobot management noted that the Company LRP and related sensitivity scenarios remained subject to change,\nsince, at the time of such presentation, management was still actively finalizing its review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial\nperformance.\nAs more fully described in the background section, following the closing of iRobot\u2019s second fiscal quarter, iRobot management presented the\nUpdated Company LRP to reflect its assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance based on additional information that first became\navailable to iRobot management following the closing of the second quarter. The Updated Company LRP principally reflected changes to iRobot\u2019s\nprojected performance for second half of fiscal year 2022, and for fiscal years 2023 to 2027 iRobot\u2019s projected revenue, non-GAAP gross profit and non-\nGAAP operating income remained unchanged except iRobot\u2019s projected adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow were modified slightly to reflect\nthe most recent and updated view of iRobot management with respect to long term working capital and capital spend.\nA portion of the sensitivity scenario based on the Updated Company LRP that reflected stronger Company performance assuming an accelerated\nmarket recovery scenario, as compared to the assumptions reflected in the Updated Company LRP, was provided to Amazon.com in response to its\nrequest during the due diligence process for certain forward-looking financial information related to an illustrative consumer market recovery scenario.\nAs more fully described in the background section, the iRobot board of directors directed Qatalyst Partners to use and rely on the Updated\nCompany LRP for purposes of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses and fairness opinion as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP\u201d.\nThe Company LRP, the Updated Company LRP and the accelerated market recovery scenario are collectively referred to herein as the \u201cprospective\nfinancial information\u201d.\nThe prospective financial information reflects estimates and assumptions made by iRobot management with respect to general business, economic,\ncompetitive, regulatory and other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are\nbeyond iRobot\u2019s control. In particular, the prospective financial information, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily was based on\nnumerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Because the prospective financial information covers multiple years, it becomes\nsubject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and is unlikely to anticipate each and every circumstance that could have an effect on iRobot\u2019s\nbusiness and its results of operations. The prospective financial information was developed solely using the information available to iRobot management\nat the time it was created and reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. The prospective financial information\nfurther reflects subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual\nresults and business developments. Important factors that may affect actual results or that may result in the prospective financial information not being\nachieved include, but are not limited to, iRobot\u2019s pending acquisition by Amazon.com, expectations regarding the timing of the merger, new product sales,\nproduct development and offerings, ability to address consumer needs, the expansion of iRobot\u2019s addressable market, factors for differentiation of\niRobot\u2019s products, product integration plans, iRobot\u2019s consumer robots, iRobot\u2019s competition, iRobot\u2019s strategy, iRobot\u2019s market position, market\nacceptance of iRobot\u2019s products, seasonal factors, revenue recognition, iRobot\u2019s profits, growth of iRobot\u2019s revenues, composition of iRobot\u2019s revenues,\niRobot\u2019s cost of revenues, units shipped, average selling prices, the impact of promotional activity and tariffs, the ability to recover tariff refund claims,\noperating expenses, selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, and compensation costs,\niRobot\u2019s projected income tax rate, iRobot\u2019s credit and letter of credit facilities, efforts to mitigate supply chain challenges, availability of\n50\nTable of Contents\nsemiconductor chips, liquidity and the impact of cost-control measures and the amount of restructuring charges related to such activities, and other\nfactors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the risk\nfactors described in iRobot\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and\nCurrent Reports on Form 8-K. The prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward\ncompliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation\nor presentation of prospective financial information. The prospective financial information cannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future\noperating results and should not be relied upon as such.\nNone of iRobot, the iRobot board of directors, Qatalyst Partners, Amazon.com or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives\nmakes any representation or warranty to any stockholder regarding the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the prospective financial\ninformation or the ultimate performance of iRobot relative to the prospective financial information. The inclusion of the summary of the prospective\nfinancial information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation or warranty of iRobot, the iRobot board of directors,\nQatalyst Partners, Amazon.com or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives that the prospective financial information or the\ninformation contained therein are material. The inclusion of the summary of the prospective financial information in this proxy statement should not be\nregarded as an indication that iRobot or anyone who receives the prospective financial information then considered, or now considers, the prospective\nfinancial information to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. In the view of iRobot\nmanagement, the prospective financial information was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best currently available estimates and judgments of\niRobot management at the time and presented, to the best of iRobot management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and iRobot\u2019s\nexpected future financial performance as of the date such information was prepared. Except as required by applicable law, neither iRobot, the iRobot board\nof directors, Qatalyst Partners, Amazon.com, nor any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives intends to, and each of them disclaims\nany obligation to, update, correct or otherwise revise the prospective financial information if any or all of it has changed or changes. Since the\nprospective financial information was created, iRobot has made publicly available its actual results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended July 2, 2022.\nYou should review iRobot\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 10, 2022 for this information.\nIn light of the foregoing, and the uncertainties inherent in the prospective financial information, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if\nany, reliance on the prospective financial information. The prospective financial information should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the\nhistorical financial statements and other information regarding iRobot in its public filings with the SEC. The prospective financial information does not\ntake into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the prospective financial information was prepared. The\nprospective financial information was developed by iRobot management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and therefore the prospective financial information does not give effect to the proposed merger or\nany changes to iRobot\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the merger, including any costs incurred in\nconnection with the proposed merger. Furthermore, the prospective financial information does not take into account the effect of any failure of the\nproposed merger to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nAdjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income and unlevered free cash flow (each as defined below) contained in the summary of the\nprospective financial information set forth below are each \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures,\u201d which are financial performance or operating measures that\nare not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed\nas a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be calculated differently than similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures published by other\ncompanies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be\nincluded in a\n51\nTable of Contents\nGAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as alternatives to, financial measures\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the prospective financial information were relied on by Qatalyst Partners\nfor the purposes of its fairness opinion and by the iRobot board of directors in connection with its consideration of a potential strategic transaction. The\nSEC rules, which otherwise would require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, do\nnot apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to a board of directors or financial advisors in connection with a proposed business combination\ntransaction, such as the merger, if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the iRobot board of directors or\nQatalyst Partners in connection with the merger. Accordingly, iRobot has not provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in\nthe prospective financial information to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nThe information and tables set forth below are included solely to give iRobot stockholders access to certain of the financial and operating financial\ninformation that were made available, as applicable, to the iRobot board of directors, Qatalyst Partners and Amazon.com, and are not included in this\nproxy statement in order to influence any stockholder\u2019s decision to vote with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement or for any other purpose.\nThe prospective financial information included in this proxy statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, iRobot management.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying\nprospective financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect\nthereto.

The Company selected Qatalyst Partners to act as the Company\u2019s financial advisor based on Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates and experience advising technology companies in connection\nwith potential strategic transactions. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the\nmeeting of the iRobot board of directors on August 4, 2022, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the iRobot board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently\nconfirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 4, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other\nmatters set forth therein, the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received\npursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or\nany affiliate of Amazon.com), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nlimitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its\nentirety. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion was provided to the iRobot board of directors and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, of the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received\npursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or\nany affiliate of Amazon.com), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement,\nincluding the merger. It does not constitute a recommendation to any Company stockholder as to how to vote with respect to the merger or any other\nmatter and does not in any manner address the price at which the shares of Company common stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached to this proxy statement as\nAnnex B.\nFor purposes of its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft, dated as of August 3, 2022, of the merger agreement (the \u201cdraft merger agreement\u201d),\ncertain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company. Qatalyst\nPartners also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including the Updated\nCompany LRP, described more fully in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d\nAdditionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior\nmanagement of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company common stock and compared\nthe financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company common stock with that of certain other selected publicly-\ntraded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered\nsuch other factors as it deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by the Company. With respect to\nthe Updated Company LRP, Qatalyst Partners was advised by Company management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed, that the Updated Company LRP\nhad been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Company management of the future financial\nperformance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners expressed no view as to such Updated Company LRP or the\nassumptions on which they were based. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the terms of the draft merger agreement would not differ materially from the final\nexecuted merger agreement and that the merger would be consummated in accordance\n54\nTable of Contents\nwith the terms set forth in the draft merger agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay of any terms or conditions. In addition, Qatalyst Partners\nassumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed transaction, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions\nwould be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed transaction.\nQatalyst Partners relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to\nlegal, tax or regulatory matters. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or\notherwise) of the Company or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners\nrelied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products\nof the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion has been approved by Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made\navailable to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and the assumptions\nused in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion\ndid not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger, or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any\nstrategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the\nmerger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with,\nthe terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), and\nQatalyst Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or\nemployees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.\nThe following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion dated August 4, 2022. The\nanalyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all\nanalyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion. For purposes of its analyses,\nQatalyst Partners utilized both the consensus of third-party research analysts\u2019 projections of the future financial performance of the Company as of\nAugust 3, 2022 (the \u201canalyst projections\u201d) and the Updated Company LRP described more fully in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014\nCertain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular\nformat. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must\nbe read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial\nanalyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners\u2019\nfinancial analyses.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of potential, present values of a share\nof Company common stock as of July 2, 2022 (which was the end of the Company\u2019s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet\ndate) by:\n\u2022\nadding:\n(a)\nthe implied net present value of the Company\u2019s corresponding estimated future unlevered free cash flows, based on the Updated\nCompany LRP, for the third quarter of calendar year 2022 through calendar year 2026 (which implied present value was calculated by\nusing a range of discount rates of 11.5% to 15.5%, based on the Company\u2019s estimated weighted average cost of capital\u037e\n55\nTable of Contents\n(b)\nthe implied net present value of the Company\u2019s terminal value, calculated by multiplying its estimated Adjusted EBITDA in calendar\nyear 2027 based on the Updated Company LRP by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated EBITDA\nof 6.0x to 12.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment), and discounted to present value using the\nsame range of discount rates used in item (a) above\u037e and\n(c)\nthe Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents of $63,000,000 as of July 2, 2022, as provided by Company management\u037e and\n\u2022\nsubtracting the $35,000,000 principal amount of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt as of July 2, 2022, as provided by Company management\u037e\nand\n\u2022\ndividing the resulting amount by: the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock\nmethod), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, each\noutstanding as of the close of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, with each of the\nabove-referenced estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated\ndilution to current stockholders through each respective applicable period due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and\ncancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Company management.\nBased on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Company common stock of approximately $49.84 to\n$94.59.\nSelected Companies Analysis\nQatalyst Partners compared selected financial information and public market multiples for the Company with publicly available information and\npublic market multiples for certain selected companies, which were selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including\nthat they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of business to the Company, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or\nhave other relevant or similar characteristics. The companies used in this comparison are listed below.\nSelected Companies\nCY2023E\nRevenue\nMultiples\nCY2023E\nEBITDA\nMultiples\nSelected Hardware Companies\nArlo Technologies, Inc.\n0.95x\n28.4x\nBang & Olufsen A/S\n0.60x\n7.1x\nBeijing Roborock Technology Co.

For purposes of this analysis, Qatalyst Partners calculated the Company\u2019s\nenterprise value assuming the Company\u2019s net cash as of July 2, 2022, which was approximately $28,000,000, as provided by Company\u2019s management.\nEstimated Revenue Multiples\nBased upon the analyst projections and the Company\u2019s closing price as of August 3, 2022, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E Revenue\nMultiple for the Company of 0.79x.\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E Revenue Multiples for each of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of\n0.60x to 0.85x and applied this range to the Company\u2019s estimated calendar year 2023 revenue of $1.595 billion based on the Updated Company LRP.\nBased on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock\nmethod), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, outstanding as of the\nclose of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for\nCompany common stock of approximately $34.29 to $48.13 based on the Updated Company LRP.\nEstimated EBITDA Multiples\nBased upon the analyst projections and the Company\u2019s closing price as of August 3, 2022, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E EBITDA\nMultiple for the Company of 12.4x.\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E EBITDA Multiples for each of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of\n7.0x to 13.0x and applied this range to the Company\u2019s estimated calendar year 2023 EBITDA of $94,000,000 based on the Updated Company LRP.\nBased on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock\nmethod), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, outstanding as of the\nclose of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for\nCompany common stock of approximately $23.78 to $43.29 based on the Updated Company LRP.\nNo company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made\njudgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many\nof these matters are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company\u2019s business and the industry in general, industry\ngrowth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in\ngeneral. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful\nmethod of using selected company data.\n57\nTable of Contents\nMiscellaneous\nIn connection with the review of the merger by the iRobot board of directors, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative\nanalyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial\nanalysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all\nanalyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may\nhave given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less\nprobable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to\nindustry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nAny estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more\nor less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nQatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger\nconsideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the\nterms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), to such\nholders. This analysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the price at which Company common stock might actually trade at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and its presentation to the iRobot board of directors was one of many factors considered by the iRobot board of\ndirectors in deciding to approve the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the\nopinion of the iRobot board of directors with respect to the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest\nthereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock\n(other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), or of whether the iRobot board of directors would have been willing to agree to different\nconsideration. The merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, payable in the merger was\ndetermined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and Amazon.com and was unanimously approved by the iRobot board of directors.\nQatalyst Partners provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration\nto the Company or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from\nwhich conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short\npositions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Amazon.com or certain of their respective\naffiliates. During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of\nits affiliates and the Company or Amazon.com pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners\nand/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or Amazon.com and their respective\naffiliates for which Qatalyst Partners would expect to receive compensation.\nQatalyst Partners provided financial advisory services to the Company in connection with the proposed transaction for which it will be paid\napproximately $31 million, $4 million of which was payable upon the delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and\nthe remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the consummation of the merger. The Company has\n58\nTable of Contents\nalso agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. The Company has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst\nPartners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners\nor any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities law, and certain expenses related to or arising out of\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 engagement.\nInterests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger",

The iRobot board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters,\nin adopting the merger agreement, and in making its recommendation that Company stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement. See the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Background of the Merger\u201d and the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Reasons for the Merger\u037e\nRecommendation of the iRobot Board of Directors.\u201d These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative\nand the table below.\nTreatment of Company Equity Awards\nStock Options. At the effective time, each outstanding Company option, whether vested or unvested, will, automatically and without any required\naction on the part of the holder thereof, fully vest and be converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than 30\ndays) following the effective time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to the Company\noption immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the merger consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of\nsuch Company option. Any Company option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the merger consideration will be cancelled\nat the effective time for no consideration or payment.\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each outstanding Company RSU award, will, automatically and without any required action on\nthe part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the RSU payment. The RSU payment will be subject to the same time-based vesting\nand forfeiture provisions as were applicable to the corresponding Company RSU award immediately prior to the effective time.\nPerformance Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each outstanding Company PSU award, will, automatically and without any required action\non the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the PSU payment. The PSU payment will be subject to the same time-vesting and\nforfeiture provisions, but not performance-vesting provisions, as were applicable to such Company PSU award immediately prior to the effective time.\nDeferred Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each outstanding Company DSU award will, automatically and without any required action on\nthe part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than 30 calendar days)\nfollowing the effective time, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Company DSU award\nmultiplied by (ii) the merger consideration.\nTreatment of ESPP. The merger agreement provides that the offering period under the ESPP in effect on the date of the merger agreement will end on\nthe earlier of (x) the next scheduled purchase date, which is November 14, 2022, or (y) no later than the business day preceding the closing date, and no\nadditional offering periods will commence thereafter.\nQuantification of Payments for Executive Officers. For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of the Company\u2019s named\nexecutive officers on settlement of their unvested Company equity awards, see\n59Table of Contents\n\u201c\u2014 Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d below. The estimated aggregate amount that would be\npayable to iRobot\u2019s two executive officers who are not named executive officers in settlement of their unvested equity-based awards if the effective time\noccurred on July 31, 2022 is $4,303,245. Vested Company Options are included in the table under \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and\nManagement\u201d below.\nQuantification of Payments for Non-Employee Directors. As of July 31, 2022, each non-employee director held 4,937 unvested restricted stock\nunits other than Ms. Golz, who held 6,285 unvested restricted stock units. All such restricted stock units held by non-employee directors will accelerate\nand fully vest on the closing date. As a result, we estimate that the aggregate amount that would be payable to the Company\u2019s seven non-employee\ndirectors for their unvested Company equity-based awards if the effective time occurred on July 31, 2022 is $2,190,327. In addition, Mr. Ali held\napproximately 6,314.19 Company DSU Awards under our Non-Employee Directors\u2019 Deferred Compensation Program as of July 31, 2022, with an estimated\nvalue of $385,166. As of July 31, 2022, none of our non-employee directors held any Company options.\nTransaction Bonus Program and Retention Bonus Program\nPursuant to the merger agreement, iRobot may establish a cash transaction bonus program providing for transaction bonuses in an aggregate\namount not to exceed $12 million (the \u201cTransaction Bonus Program\u201d). Awards under the Transaction Bonus Program vest and become payable as follows:\n(i) 25% on the six-month anniversary of the date of the merger agreement, (ii) 25% on the closing of the merger and (iii) 50% on the three-month\nanniversary of the closing of the merger, subject to the employee\u2019s continued employment through the applicable payment date\u037e provided, however, if an\nemployee\u2019s employment is terminated by iRobot without cause on or after the closing of the merger and prior to the date that the full amount of the bonus\npayable to such employee under the Transaction Bonus Program has been paid, the unpaid portion of the bonus shall, subject to the employee\u2019s\nexecution and non-revocation of a general release of claims, become payable to such employee.\nIn addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, iRobot may establish a cash retention bonus program providing for retention bonuses in an\naggregate amount not to exceed $12 million (the \u201cRetention Bonus Program\u201d). Awards under the Retention Bonus Program will vest and become payable\non the six-month anniversary of the closing of the merger, subject to the employee\u2019s continued employment through such date\u037e provided, however, if an\nemployee\u2019s employment is terminated by iRobot without cause on or after the closing of the merger and prior to the date that the bonus payable to such\nemployee under the Retention Bonus Program has been paid, the bonus shall, subject to the employee\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a general\nrelease of claims, become payable to such employee.\nAwards under the Transaction Bonus Program and the Retention Bonus Program will be determined by iRobot\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and\nExecutive Vice President, Human Resources and Corporate Communications, after reasonable consultation with Amazon.com. No employee is eligible to\nreceive a bonus under both the Transaction Bous Program and the Retention Bonus Program. No bonus under either the Transaction Bonus Program or\nthe Retention Bonus Program may exceed 100% of the applicable employee\u2019s base salary. iRobot\u2019s Chief Executive Officer is not eligible to receive a\nbonus under either the Transaction Bonus Program or the Retention Bonus Program. iRobot\u2019s other executive officers are eligible to receive bonuses\nunder the Transaction Bonus Program and the Retention Bonus Program and the aggregate amount of the bonuses the executive officers are eligible to\nreceive under the Transaction Bonus Program and the Retention Bonus Program is $2,240,000, including bonuses to the named executive officers as\ndescribed in the Golden Parachute Compensation Table below.\nExecutive Agreements\nEach of iRobot\u2019s executive officers is party to an executive agreement with iRobot that provides for severance benefits upon a termination of\nemployment by iRobot other than for cause within the period beginning\n60\nTable of Contents\non the date that is 45 days prior to the date of the public announcement of the execution of a definitive agreement for a change in control and ending on\nthe first anniversary of the effective date of a change in control, or if such executive officer resigns for good reason during the one-year period following\nthe effective date of a change in control (collectively, a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d). The merger will qualify as a \u201cchange in control\u201d within the meaning of\neach executive agreement, and each executive officer is eligible to receive the following severance payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination:\n\u2022\naccelerated vesting of all unvested equity awards held by such executive officer as of the date of the termination of employment or, if later,\nthe date of announcement of the change in control\u037e\n\u2022\nan amount equal to 200% of the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary at the highest annualized rate in effect during the period between\nimmediately prior to the effective date of the change in control and the date of termination of employment\u037e\n\u2022\nan amount equal to 200% of the executive officer\u2019s highest target cash incentive compensation with respect to the period beginning in the\nyear prior to the year in which the effective date of the change in control occurs and ending in the year in which the executive officer\u2019s\nemployment terminates\u037e and\n\u2022\nin the event that the executive officer elects continued health, vision and/or dental coverage under COBRA, payment of the portion of\nmonthly premium payments that iRobot pays for active employees for continued health, dental and vision benefits until the earliest of (a)\nthe second anniversary of the termination date, (b) the date on which the executive officer becomes covered under a comparable group plan\nfor such coverage, and (c) the date on which the executive officer ceases to be eligible for COBRA continuation for such coverage.\nThese severance payments and benefits under the executive agreements are subject to, among other things, the executive officer\u2019s execution of a\nseparation agreement, including a general release of claims, in a form and of a scope reasonably acceptable to iRobot and the executive officer\u2019s\ncontinued compliance with any noncompetition, inventions and/or nondisclosure obligations owed to iRobot. The executive agreements also provide\nthat payments and benefits payable to each executive officer will be reduced so that no portion of such payments and benefits are subject to the excise\ntax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), unless the executive officer would be better off on an after-tax\nbasis receiving all such payments and benefits.\nFor an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to iRobot\u2019s named executive officers upon a\nqualifying termination in connection with the merger, see \u201c\u2014 Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d\nbelow. The estimated aggregate amount (excluding the value of accelerated vesting of unvested equity awards, which is described in \u201c\u2014 Treatment of\nCompany Equity Awards\u201d above) that would be payable to the Company\u2019s two executive officers who are not named executive officers under the\nexecutive agreements if they were to experience a qualifying termination on July 31, 2022 is $2,890,520.\nNew Arrangements with iRobot Executive Officers\nOn August 4, 2022, Mr. Angle entered into a letter agreement with Amazon.com Services LLC (\u201cAmazon.com Services\u201d) pursuant to which Mr.\nAngle will serve as CEO, iRobot Corporation, effective as of the closing date of the transaction (the \u201cStart Date\u201d).

In the event of an Involuntary Termination Upon a Change in Control (as defined in the\nAngle Executive Agreement) or a Resignation for Good Reason Upon a Change in Control (as such definition in the Angle Executive Agreement is\nmodified by the letter agreement), Mr. Angle shall remain eligible to receive the severance and other termination benefits under the Angle Executive\nAgreement (as modified by the letter agreement). Upon the first anniversary of the closing date, the Angle Executive Agreement\u2019s Term (as defined in\nsuch agreement) shall end pursuant to the Angle Executive Agreement without having any impact on Mr. Angle\u2019s employment with Amazon.com\nServices.\nThe letter agreement also provides that Mr. Angle\u2019s employment is conditioned on him executing a Confidentiality and Invention Assignment\nAgreement, which Mr. Angle executed on August 4, 2022.\n62\nTable of Contents\nIndemnification\u037e Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Insurance\nThe merger agreement provides that after the effective time, Amazon.com will cause the surviving corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the\nindividuals who on or prior to the effective time were officers or directors of iRobot or its subsidiaries or were serving at the request of iRobot as an\nofficer, director, member, trustee or fiduciary of any other corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise with\nrespect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of iRobot or any of its subsidiaries at any time prior to the\neffective time to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (including with respect to advancement of expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees and advancing\nsuch expenses and fees without requiring any preliminary determination of entitlement subject to such individual\u2019s affirmation or undertaking if required\nunder the DGCL).\nAmazon.com and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to exculpation or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time\nexisting as of August 4, 2022 in favor of the current and former directors and officers of iRobot or any of its subsidiaries or any of their predecessors and\nthe heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of such officer or director, as provided in iRobot\u2019s or each of its subsidiaries\u2019 respective\ncertificates of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) or in any agreement, will survive the merger and the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and\nNon-U.S. Holders (each as defined below). This summary is general in nature and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.\nThe effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This\ndiscussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury Department regulations promulgated under the Code\n(the \u201cTreasury Regulations\u201d), court decisions, published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), and\nother applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any\ntime, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution\ntax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the alternative minimum tax, the rules pertaining to \u201cqualified small business\nstock\u201d or \u201cSection 1244 stock\u201d, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or U.S. federal tax laws other than\nthose pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.\nThis discussion is limited to stockholders who hold their shares of common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the\nCode (generally, property held for investment purposes). Further, this discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax\nconsequences that may be relevant to stockholders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address the tax\nconsequences that may be relevant to stockholders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as insurance\ncompanies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, U.S. Holders\nthat have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, stockholders who hold shares of common stock through an individual retirement or other tax-\ndeferred account, tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and other financial\ninstitutions, mutual funds, certain former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States, partnerships (or other entities or arrangements\ntreated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), S corporations or other pass-through entities and investors in such pass-through entities,\nreal estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, stockholders who hold shares of common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive\nsale, conversion or other integrated transaction, stockholders who will hold (actually or constructively) an equity interest in Amazon.com immediately\nafter the merger, stockholders who own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent (5%) or more of Company\u2019s common stock (by\nvote or value)\u037e stockholders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or\nresident outside the U.S.\u037e stockholders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the shares of\ncommon stock being taken into account in a \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d (as defined in the Code)\u037e stockholders who are controlled foreign\ncorporations, passive foreign investment companies or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax\u037e and stockholders who\nacquired their shares of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements). This discussion also does\nnot address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to (i) holders of options, restricted stock units or other equity securities or (ii) holders of shares of\ncommon stock who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger under the DGCL.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a\nbeneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner\nand the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors\nregarding the consequences of the merger.\n65Table of Contents\nWe have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the\nfollowing summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge\nby the IRS in the event of litigation.\nTHE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX PLANNING. WE URGE YOU TO\nCONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nMERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF THE ALTERNATIVE\nMINIMUM TAX, THE UNEARNED INCOME MEDICARE CONTRIBUTION TAX, QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESS STOCK, AND FEDERAL ESTATE,\nGIFT AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is (or is treated as) a citizen or resident of the U.S.\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the U.S. or any state thereof or the\nDistrict of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and the control of one or more U.S. persons as defined in\nSection 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S.\nperson.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) a\nforeign corporation, (ii) a nonresident alien individual, or (iii) a foreign estate or trust that in each case is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net-\nincome basis on income or gain from common stock.\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S.\nHolder and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. Any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and\nwill be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger.\nLong-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers, including individuals, are generally taxed at preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or different prices,\nsuch U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of common stock.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S. (and, if required by an applicable income tax\ntreaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.), in which case such gain\ngenerally will be subject to\n66\nTable of Contents\nU.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. Holders, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be\nsubject to the branch profits tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e or\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger, and certain other\nrequirements are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%), which gain may be\noffset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder if the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns\nwith respect to such losses.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%)) may apply to the proceeds received by a\nstockholder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber and certifies that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such stockholder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS\nForm W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a certification of such stockholder\u2019s foreign status on the\nappropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (ii) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against the\nstockholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nWithholding on Foreign Entities\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (commonly known as\n\u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) on certain payments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially\ndefined under these rules) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and\nprovide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and\ndebt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also\ngenerally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity\nprovides the withholding agent with either a certification that it does not have any substantial direct or indirect U.S. owners or provides information\nregarding substantial direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity. An intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and an applicable foreign country\nmay modify these requirements. FATCA withholding currently applies to payments of dividends. The Treasury Department has released proposed\nregulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) applicable to the gross proceeds of\na sale or other disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may\ngenerally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nStockholders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on the disposition of common\nstock pursuant to the merger.",

The merger cannot be consummated until after the mandatory approval requirements outside of the United States have been\nobtained under applicable antitrust and foreign investment laws. The relevant authorities could take such actions under the applicable antitrust and\nforeign investment laws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial\nassets of one or both of the parties, requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or\nrequiring the parties to agree to other remedies. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay\nthe completion, or reduce the anticipated benefits, of the merger.\nAlthough Amazon.com and iRobot believe that the merger will not violate the antitrust or foreign investment laws and expect that all required\nregulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, Amazon.com and iRobot cannot assure that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be\ntimely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions,\nrestrictions, qualifications, requirements or limitations on the completion of the merger, including the requirement to divest assets, license or hold\nseparate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or agree to other remedies, or require changes to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement, or that a challenge to the merger on antitrust or foreign investment grounds will not be made, or if such challenge is made, what the result will\nbe. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take\nto obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial period of time\nbetween the approval of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement by stockholders and the completion of the merger.\nLitigation Related to the Merger",

The foregoing complaint is referred to as the \u201cMerger\nAction\u201d.\n68Table of Contents\nThe Merger Action generally alleges that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on August 25, 2022 misrepresents\nand/or omits certain purportedly material information relating to the Company\u2019s financial projections, the analyses performed by the financial advisor to\nthe iRobot board of directors in connection with the merger, potential conflicts of interest of the Company\u2019s officers and directors, and the events that led\nto the signing of the merger agreement. The Merger Action asserts violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated\nthereunder against all defendants (the Company and its board of directors) and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Company\u2019s\ndirectors. The Merger Action seeks, among other things, an injunction enjoining the stockholder vote on the merger and the consummation of the merger\nunless and until certain additional information is disclosed to iRobot stockholders, costs of the action, including plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and experts\u2019\nfees, and other relief the court may deem just and proper.\nThe Company cannot predict the outcome of the Merger Action. The Company believes that the Merger Action is without merit and the Company\nand the individual defendants intend to vigorously defend against the Merger Action and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar\ncomplaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings, unless such\ndisclosure is required by law.\nDelisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock",

All references\nin Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of iRobot common stock unless otherwise expressly noted herein,\nand all such references to a \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d mean a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on\nbehalf of such person unless otherwise expressly noted herein.\nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners who: (i) deliver a written demand for appraisal of their\nshares to iRobot prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement\u037e (ii) do not vote in favor of the merger\u037e (iii)\ncontinuously hold of record or beneficially own, as applicable, such shares through the effective date of the merger\u037e and (iv) otherwise comply with, and\ndo not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under, the applicable provisions set forth in Section 262, may be entitled to have\ntheir shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of iRobot common stock,\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount\ndetermined to be \u201cfair value.\u201d However, assuming shares of iRobot common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the\nmerger (which we expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as\nto all iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds\n1% of the outstanding shares of iRobot common stock (as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262) or (b) the value of the\nconsideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b), and the assumption that shares of iRobot\ncommon stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the merger, are referred to in this summary as the \u201cownership\nthresholds\u201d).\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty\n(20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for\nwhich appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice either a copy of Section 262 or information directing the\nstockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement\nconstitutes iRobot\u2019s notice to iRobot stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 may be\naccessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). In\nconnection with the merger, any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve his, her or its\nright to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the\nloss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the\nmerger consideration described in the merger agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal\nof shares of iRobot common stock, iRobot believes that if a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner considers exercising such rights, that person should\nseek the advice of legal counsel.\n100Table of Contents\niRobot stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of iRobot common stock must do ALL\nof the following:\n\u2022\nthe person must not vote in favor of the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe person must deliver to iRobot a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger\nagreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe person must continuously hold or beneficially own, as applicable, the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective\ndate of the merger (if a stockholder or beneficial owner transfers the shares before the effective time, such person will lose appraisal rights\nwith respect to the shares so transferred)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe person, another stockholder or beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal or the surviving corporation must file a petition\nin the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after\nthe effective date of the merger. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe person must otherwise comply with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nMaking a Written Demand\nAny iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to iRobot, before the vote is taken on the proposal to\napprove and adopt the merger agreement, a written demand for the appraisal of the iRobot stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s shares. The person making\nthe written demand must be a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner, as applicable, on the date the written demand for appraisal is made, and such\nperson must continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, the shares as to which such demand relates through the effective date of the merger.\nA person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. In the\ncase of a holder of record of iRobot common stock, a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in\nfavor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the iRobot stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify\nany previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a iRobot stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights\nmust ensure that the proxy submitted contains instructions to vote against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting. In\nthe case of a beneficial owner, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d for their customers do not have\ndiscretionary authority to vote those shares on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement without specific voting instructions from the\nbeneficial owner on such proposal, but such brokers, banks or other nominees will vote such shares as instructed if the beneficial owner provides such\ninstructions. If a beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d instructs such person\u2019s broker, bank or other nominee to vote such person\u2019s shares in\nfavor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, and does not revoke such instruction prior to the vote on the proposal to approve and\nadopt the merger agreement, then such shares will be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver\nof such beneficial owner\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a beneficial owner who\nwishes to exercise appraisal rights must either not provide any instructions to such person\u2019s broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the proposal\nto approve and adopt the merger agreement or must instruct such broker, bank or other nominee to vote against the approval and adoption of the merger\nagreement or abstain from voting on such proposal.\nNeither voting against the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting on such proposal will, in and of itself,\nconstitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of\n101\nTable of Contents\nSection 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the\nmerger agreement. A iRobot stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to\napprove and adopt the merger agreement will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nA demand for appraisal made by a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record or beneficial\nowner, as applicable, and must reasonably inform iRobot of the identity of such stockholder or beneficial owner. In addition, in the case of a demand for\nappraisal made by a iRobot beneficial owner, the demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made,\nbe accompanied by documentary evidence of the beneficial owner\u2019s ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or securities account statement containing\nsuch information or a letter from the broker or other record holder of such shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary\nevidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by\nthe surviving corporation under Section 262 and to be set forth on the verified list required by subsection (f) of Section 262 (discussed further below).\nWhether made by an iRobot stockholder or a beneficial owner, a written demand for appraisal must state that the person intends thereby to demand\nappraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are held of record or beneficially owned in a fiduciary or representative\ncapacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand should be executed by or on behalf of such holder of record or beneficial owner, and\nif the shares are held of record or beneficially owned by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be\nexecuted by or on behalf of all such joint holders of record or beneficial owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more\njoint stockholders or beneficial owners, as applicable, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record or beneficial owner\u037e however,\nthe agent must identify the record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners, respectively, and should expressly disclose that, in executing the\ndemand, the agent is acting as agent for such record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners, as applicable.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\niRobot Corporation\n8 Crosby Drive\nBedford, MA 01730\nAttention: Secretary\nAny iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who has delivered a written demand to iRobot and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares and accept the\nmerger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal by delivering to iRobot a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the effective date of the\nmerger will require written approval of the surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any\nperson without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares and to accept the merger\nconsideration with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the merger.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each iRobot stockholder\nwho has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant\n102\nTable of Contents\nto Section 262 and has not voted in favor of the merger, and any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal in such person\u2019s name pursuant to\nSection 262, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation or any iRobot stockholder or beneficial\nowner who has demanded appraisal of such person\u2019s shares and otherwise complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under\nSection 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving\ncorporation in the case of a petition filed by a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner, demanding a determination of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares held by\nall persons entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and iRobot\nstockholders and beneficial owners should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of iRobot common stock. Accordingly, any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who desires to have their shares appraised\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of iRobot common stock\nwithin the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner to file such a petition within the period\nspecified in Section 262 could nullify the person\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and\nwho is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the\naggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger and with respect to which iRobot has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, in the case of a demand made by a beneficial owner in such\nperson\u2019s name, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate\nnumber). Such statement must be given by the surviving corporation to the requesting person within ten (10) days after receipt by the surviving\ncorporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal,\nwhichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy thereof must be made upon the\nsurviving corporation, which will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly\nverified list (which we refer to in this summary as the \u201cverified list\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for\ntheir shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the surviving corporation and all persons shown on\nthe verified list at the addresses stated therein. The costs of these notices are borne by the surviving corporation. After notice to iRobot stockholders\nand beneficial owners as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those\npersons who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require\nthe persons who demanded an appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation\nthereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any person fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss\nthe proceedings as to such person. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all iRobot stockholders and beneficial\nowners who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then all\niRobot stockholders\u2019 and beneficial owners\u2019 right to an appraisal will cease.\nDetermination of \u201cFair Value\u201d\nAfter determining the persons entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing\n103\nTable of Contents\nappraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of iRobot common stock,\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount\ndetermined to be the \u201cfair value.\u201d Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the\nmerger through the date of payment of the judgment will compound quarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date the judgment is paid. However, at any\ntime before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each person entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the sum of (1) the\ndifference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) any interest\naccrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary\ncash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nIn determining \u201cfair value,\u201d the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the\nSupreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining \u201cfair value\u201d in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of\nvalue by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Supreme Court of\nDelaware stated that, in making this determination of \u201cfair value,\u201d the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the\nnature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has recently indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant factors the Delaware Court of Chancery may\nconsider in determining fair value and that absent deficiencies in the sale process the transaction price should be given \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d Section\n262 provides that \u201cfair value\u201d is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d\nbut which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of\nDelaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nmerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\niRobot stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares as so determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they\ndid not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger\nconsideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, \u201cfair value\u201d under Section 262. No representation is made\nas to the outcome of the appraisal of \u201cfair value\u201d as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners\nshould recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration.\nNeither iRobot nor Amazon.com anticipates offering more than the merger consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights, and each of iRobot and\nAmazon.com reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding,\nthat for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of iRobot common stock is less than the merger consideration.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name\nappears on the verified list may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights. When\nthe fair value of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment\n104\nTable of Contents\nof such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled thereto and upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may\norder. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced. The costs of the\nappraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\nand charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name\nappears on the verified list who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also\norder that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro\nrata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal not dismissed by the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 262(k). In the\nabsence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nFrom and after the effective date of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person\u2019s shares\nwill be entitled to vote such shares of iRobot common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock,\nexcept dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of iRobot common stock, if any, payable to iRobot stockholders as of a time prior to the\neffective time. If any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of iRobot common stock under Section 262\nvalidly withdraws, fails to perfect, or otherwise loses, such holder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of iRobot common\nstock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time into the right to receive the merger consideration. A person will fail to perfect, or\neffectively lose, his, her or its right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the\nmerger or if neither of the ownership thresholds is met. As described above, a person may validly withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal if the\nperson delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares in\naccordance with Section 262.\nFailure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any iRobot\nstockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\nENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.\nThe foregoing summary of the rights of the iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does not\npurport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by such persons to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified\nin its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires adherence to the applicable provisions of\nthe DGCL.\n105\nTable of Contents\nMULTIPLE STOCKHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS",

In light of the special meeting, the\nCompany will hold an annual meeting of iRobot stockholders in the year 2023 only if the merger is not completed and iRobot stockholders will continue to\nbe entitled to attend and participate in such meeting.\nGenerally, iRobot stockholders have the opportunity to submit proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for consideration at the\nannual meeting of iRobot stockholders by submitting their proposals in writing to our Secretary at least 120 days before the date of our proxy statement\nfor the previous year\u2019s annual meeting, and otherwise complying with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. As described in our annual\nproxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting filed on April 11, 2022, iRobot stockholders have the opportunity to submit proper proposals for inclusion in\nour proxy statement and for consideration at the annual meeting of iRobot stockholders to be held in 2023 (if such meeting is held) by submitting their\nproposals in writing to our Secretary at the Company\u2019s principal executive offices no later than the close of business on December 12, 2022 and otherwise\ncomplying with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.

The\nCompany will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nPursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (\u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d) that is outstanding as of\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than (a) shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of Parent and shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case, not held on\nbehalf of third parties and (b) Dissenting Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), will cease to be outstanding and will cease to exist as\nof the effective time of the Merger and will be converted into the right to receive $61.00 per share in cash, without interest (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d).\nThe terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the\nMerger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft, dated as of August 3, 2022, of the Merger Agreement (the \u201cDraft Merger\nAgreement\u201d) and certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the\nCompany. We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including\nfinancial projections and operating data of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d).
