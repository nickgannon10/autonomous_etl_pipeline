            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions\nregarding the special meeting and the merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions\nthat may be important to you. You should read the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this\nproxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by\nreference in this proxy statement.\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\nOn November 14, 2021, the Company entered into the merger agreement with Parent and Merger Sub.\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company,\nwith the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Parent.\nYou are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board in\nfavor of the merger proposal and the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting described\nbelow under \u201c- What proposals will be considered at the special meeting?\u201d\nAs a holder of common stock, what will I receive in the merger?\nIf the merger is consummated, you will be entitled to receive $90.50 in cash, without interest and less\nany applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock that you own immediately prior to the\neffective time.\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger - Material U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 65 for a more detailed description of the\nUnited States federal income tax consequences of the merger. You should consult your own tax advisor\nfor a full understanding of how the merger will affect your federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. taxes.\nWill I receive any regular quarterly dividends with respect to the shares of common stock that I own?\nOn October 27, 2021, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share of common\nstock for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, which will be paid on January 7, 2022 to CyrusOne\nstockholders of record at the close of business on January 3, 2022. Pursuant to the terms of the merger\nagreement, during the pendency of the merger, the Company is permitted to pay regular quarterly\ndividends, at a quarterly rate not to exceed $0.52 per share of common stock, to CyrusOne stockholders.\nDividends are declared and paid at the discretion of the Board. The Board may change the Company\u2019s\ndividend policy at any time and there can be no assurance as to amount or timing of dividends in the\nfuture.\nThe Company is also permitted to authorize, declare and pay any special dividends to CyrusOne\nstockholders during the term of the merger agreement that, in the reasonable discretion of the Board, on\nthe advice of legal counsel, are necessary or advisable to maintain our status as a REIT or to avoid the\npayment of income or excise tax or to preserve the tax status of any subsidiary (with any such special\ndividend resulting in a corresponding decrease to the merger consideration).\nFor more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger - Dividends\u201d\nbeginning on page 67.\nWhat will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the merger?\nAs of the effective time:\neach Company stock option outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled in\nexchange for the merger consideration, less the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares\nsubject to such Company stock option, but any Company stock option with an exercise price that is\nequal to or greater than the merger consideration will be canceled for no consideration\u037e\neach Company restricted share award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be\ncanceled in exchange for the merger consideration, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such\n13 \u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany restricted share award, with the number of such shares subject to such Company restricted\nshare award determined assuming the maximum level of achievement of any applicable performance\ncriteria\u037e\neach Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled in exchange\nfor the merger consideration, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such Company RSU, plus\nthe amount of any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents, with the number of shares subject to\nsuch Company RSU determined assuming the maximum level of achievement of any applicable\nperformance criteria\u037e and\neach LTIP unit award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled in exchange\nfor the merger consideration, multiplied by the number of LTIP units subject to the LTIP unit award,\nplus the amount of any declared but unpaid distributions, in each case, with the number of LTIP units\nsubject to such LTIP unit award determined assuming the maximum level of achievement of any\napplicable performance criteria.\nWith respect to Company equity awards granted prior to the date of the merger agreement or granted at\nany time to non-employee directors, the consideration described above will become vested and payable\nat the effective time, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. With respect to Company equity\nawards granted following the date of the merger agreement (other than those granted to non-employee\ndirectors), the consideration described above will remain subject to any time-vesting criteria that\napplied to the applicable Company equity award, including with respect to any accelerated vesting\nterms upon a qualifying termination of employment. For company equity awards subject to performance\ncriteria, the maximum level of performance is 200% or 300% of target performance, as applicable.\nSee \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTreatment of Company Equity Awards\u201d beginning on page 72.\nWhat will happen to the Company ESPP?\nFollowing the date of the merger agreement: (i) with respect to any outstanding Purchase Period(s)\nunder the Company ESPP as of such date, no participant can increase the percentage amount of his or\nher payroll deduction election in effect as of such date for such Purchase Period(s) and no new\nparticipants can participate in such Purchase Period(s)\u037e (ii) no new Purchase Period will commence\nunder the Company ESPP on or after such date\u037e (iii) any Purchase Period under the Company ESPP that\ndoes not end prior to the effective time will terminate and a Purchase Date will occur immediately prior to\nthe effective time with respect to such Purchase Period, in which case any shares of common stock\npurchased pursuant to such Purchase Period will be treated the same as all other shares of common\nstock in the merger\u037e and (iv) immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of the effective time, the\nCompany ESPP will terminate.\nWhen and where is the special meeting of our stockholders?\nThe special meeting of stockholders of the Company will be held on February 1, 2022 at 9:30 a.m.,\nCentral Time (10:30 a.m., Eastern Time), in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special\nmeeting, you should visit https://meetnow.global/MTUZUCT. You will be required to enter a control\nnumber, included on your proxy card, voting instruction form or other notice that you may receive,\nwhich will allow you to participate in the virtual meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you\nare a CyrusOne stockholder as of the record date.\nWho is entitled to vote at the special meeting?\nOnly CyrusOne stockholders of record at the close of business on December 23, 2021, the record date\nfor the special meeting, will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any\npostponement or adjournment thereof. As of the close of business on the record date, there were\n129,555,316 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each CyrusOne stockholder is\nentitled to one vote per share of common stock held by such CyrusOne stockholder on the record date\non each of the proposals presented in this proxy statement.\nIf on December 23, 2021, you were a \u201crecord\u201d holder of common stock (that is, if you held common stock in\nyour own name in the stock register maintained by our transfer agent, Computershare Trust\n14 \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany, N.A.), you are entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy. Whether or not you\nintend to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to authorize a proxy to vote now, online,\nby phone or by proxy card to ensure that your vote is counted.\nIf on December 23, 2021, you were the beneficial owner of common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d (that is, if you\nheld common stock through your broker), then these materials are being forwarded to you by your\nbroker. You may direct your broker how to vote your common stock by following the voting instructions\non the form provided by your broker. If you hold any common stock through your broker and wish to\nattend the virtual special meeting, you may attend the virtual special meeting but may not be able to\nvote unless you first obtain a legal proxy issued in your name from your broker or other nominee. The\ncut-off time for submitting a legal proxy is January 27, 2022, three business days prior to the date of the\nspecial meeting, at 4:00 p.m., Central Time (5:00 p.m., Eastern Time).\nWhat proposals will be considered at the special meeting?\nAt the special meeting, CyrusOne stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following\nproposals:\na proposal to approve the merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the merger\nagreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the \u201cmerger proposal\u201d)\u037e\na proposal to approve, by advisory (non-binding) vote, the compensation that may be paid or become\npayable to our named executive officers in connection with the consummation of the merger (the\n\u201cadvisory compensation proposal\u201d)\u037e and\na proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional\nproxies if there are insufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger proposal (the\n\u201cadjournment proposal\u201d).\nWhat constitutes a quorum for purposes of the special meeting?\nThe presence in person or by proxy of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes\nentitled to be cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting.\nVirtual attendance at the special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the\nspecial meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be\ncounted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\nIf a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the CyrusOne stockholders entitled to vote at the\nspecial meeting, present virtually or by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting. In addition, our bylaws\npermit the chair of the special meeting, acting in his or her own discretion and without any action by our\nstockholders, to adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the\nspecial meeting. In either case, the adjourned meeting may take place without further notice other than\nby an announcement made at the special meeting unless the adjournment is for more than 120 days after\nthe original record date or if, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting,\nin which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to\nvote at the special meeting (subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, including that the\nspecial meeting generally may not be held, without Parent\u2019s consent, on a date that is more than 30 days\nafter the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled). In the event that a quorum is not\npresent at the special meeting, or if there are insufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the\ntime of the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be postponed or adjourned to solicit\nadditional proxies.\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?\nThe approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock\nentitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Under Maryland law and the\nmerger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger.\nNote that you may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the advisory\ncompensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa. Abstentions or failures to vote\n15 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a CyrusOne stockholder\u2019s behalf) will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the\nvotes cast on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at the special\nmeeting, abstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a CyrusOne\nstockholder\u2019s behalf) will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory compensation proposal.\nThe approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast\non such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting,\nabstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a CyrusOne\nstockholder\u2019s behalf) will have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal. The Company\ndoes not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal is approved at the special meeting.\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote?\nThe Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend the approval of\nthe merger proposal, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fReasons for\nthe Merger\u201d beginning on page 41.\nHow do the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers intend to vote?\nAs of December 23, 2021, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned in the\naggregate 461,973 shares of common stock, or approximately 0.4% of the outstanding shares of common\nstock as of December 23, 2021. Although none of the directors or executive officers is obligated to vote\nto approve the merger proposal, we currently expect that each of these individuals will vote all of his or\nher shares in favor of each of the proposals to be presented at the special meeting.\nDo any of the Company\u2019s directors or executive officers have any interests in the merger that are different from,\nor in addition to, my interests as a CyrusOne stockholder?\nIn considering the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting, you should be aware that the\nCompany\u2019s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different\nfrom, or in addition to, your interests as a CyrusOne stockholder. The members of the Board were aware\nof and considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the merger proposal and\nrecommend that CyrusOne stockholders approve the merger proposal. These interests may include:\nthe treatment of Company equity awards provided for under the merger agreement (as described\nbelow in \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fTreatment of Company Equity Awards\u201d)\u037e\nseverance and other benefits in the case of certain qualifying terminations under the terms of an\nindividual employment or severance agreement\u037e\ncash-based deal retention bonuses under a program established for the benefit of certain Company\nemployees, including executive officers\u037e\neach participant (including each executive officer) in the Company\u2019s annual bonus plan will be eligible\nfor a pro-rated annual bonus for the year in which the effective time occurs if such participant is\nterminated prior to the date such bonuses are earned and he or she otherwise qualifies for severance\u037e\nand\ncontinued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement, the Company\u2019s\norganizational documents and indemnification agreements the Company has entered into with each of\nits directors and executive officers.\nThese interests are described in more detail, and certain of them are quantified, in the section of this\nproxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Merger\u201d beginning on page 59.\n16 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhat happens if I transfer my common stock before the special meeting?\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you own\ncommon stock on the record date but transfer your shares after the record date but prior to the special\nmeeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares of common stock at the special meeting.\nHowever, the right to receive the merger consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred\nyour shares of common stock.\nHow do I vote if I am a CyrusOne stockholder of record?\nIf you are a CyrusOne stockholder of record, you may vote in advance by authorizing a proxy for the\nspecial meeting via the internet, by telephone or by completing, signing, dating and mailing the\nenclosed proxy card in the envelope provided. In order to submit a vote by proxy via the internet or\ntelephone, follow the applicable instructions shown on the proxy card mailed to you. You may also vote\nby attending the virtual special meeting and voting during the live webcast.\nFor more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, please see the section of\nthis proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u202f-\u202fVoting Procedures\u201d beginning on page 26.\nWhether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we urge you to vote now to ensure your\nvote is counted. You may still attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast if you\nhave already voted by proxy.\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?\nThe approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock\nentitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. If you fail to authorize a proxy\nto vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other\nnominee on how to vote, the effect will be that the shares of common stock that you own will not be\ncounted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have\nthe same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, if you\nfail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your\nbroker on how to vote, it will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. Abstentions will not be\nconsidered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory compensation\nproposal or the adjournment proposal.\nCan I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?\nYes. For CyrusOne stockholders of record, any time after you have submitted a proxy card and before the\nproxy card is exercised, you may revoke or change your vote in one of three ways:\nYou may submit a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy\nor voting instructions) whether made on the internet, by telephone or by mail.\nYou may submit a written notice of revocation to the Company\u2019s Corporate Secretary at 2850 N.\nHarwood St., Suite 2200, Dallas, TX 75201.\nYou may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Attendance at the virtual\nspecial meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy.\nPlease note that if you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or a written notice of\nrevocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of\nrevocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the special meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d, you will need to revoke or resubmit your proxy through your\nbroker and in accordance with its procedures. If your broker allows you to submit a proxy via the\ninternet or by telephone, you may be able to change your vote by submitting a new proxy via the\ninternet or by telephone (or by mail). In order to attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the\nwebcast, you will need to obtain a proxy from your broker, the CyrusOne stockholder of record.\n17 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement\nor multiple proxy or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your common stock in more than\none brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account\nin which you hold common stock. Please submit each proxy and voting instruction card that you receive to\nensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted.\nIf I hold my common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?\nNo. Promptly after the effective time, and in any event not later than the fifth business day after the\neffective time, Parent will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of common stock entitled to the\nmerger consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions advising such CyrusOne stockholder how\nto surrender its common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. Each holder of common stock\nwill be entitled to receive the merger consideration upon the surrender of such certificate for cancelation\nto the paying agent together with the associated letter of transmittal, duly completely and validly\nexecuted in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably\nrequired by the paying agent. You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy\ncard, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the paying agent without a letter of\ntransmittal. If you hold common stock in non-certificated book-entry form, you will not be required to\ndeliver a stock certificate, and you will instead receive your cash payment after the paying agent\nreceives the documents requested in the applicable instruction.\nAm I entitled to exercise appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder?\nNo. As permitted by Maryland law, our charter provides that holders of common stock may not exercise\nany appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value\nof their shares in connection with a merger unless the Board, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of\nthe Board, determines that such rights apply. The Board has made no such determination. In addition,\nbecause shares of our common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market as of the record\ndate for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting, our stockholders who\nobject to the merger do not have any appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting\nstockholder under the Maryland General Corporation Law in connection with the merger.\nWhen is the merger expected to be consummated?\nWe currently expect to consummate the merger during the second quarter of 2022, subject to receipt of\nthe Company stockholder approval and the required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver\nof the other conditions to the merger described in the merger agreement.\nWhat effect will the merger have on the Company?\nIf the merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and the Company\nwill continue to exist following the merger as a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Parent. If the merger\nis consummated, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the common stock to be delisted\nfrom the NASDAQ Global Select Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as\nreasonably practicable following the effective time, and, accordingly, the common stock will no longer\nbe publicly traded.\nWhat happens if the merger is not consummated?\nIn the event that the Company stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated\nfor any other reason, CyrusOne stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common\nstock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company,\nthe common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the\ncommon stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and the Company\u2019s stockholders\nwill continue to own their shares of common stock and will continue to be subject to the same general\nrisks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of the common stock.\n18 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nThe SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the\ndelivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more CyrusOne\nstockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those\nCyrusOne stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding\u201d, potentially\nmeans extra convenience for CyrusOne stockholders and cost savings for companies.\nBrokers with account holders who are CyrusOne stockholders of the Company may be \u201chouseholding\u201d\nproxy materials. A single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple CyrusOne stockholders sharing an\naddress unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected CyrusOne stockholders. If\nyou have received notice from your broker that they will be \u201chouseholding\u201d communications to your\naddress, such \u201chouseholding\u201d will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your\nconsent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in \u201chouseholding\u201d and would prefer to receive\na separate proxy statement, please notify your broker and direct your written request to CyrusOne Inc.,\nAttention: Investor Relations Department, 2850 N. Harwood St., Suite 2200, Dallas, TX 75201 or call 972-\n350-0060. CyrusOne stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their\naddress and would like to request \u201chouseholding\u201d of their communications should contact their broker.\nWho can help answer my questions?\nIf you need assistance in completing your proxy card or have questions regarding the special meeting,\nplease contact Okapi Partners, which is acting as the Company\u2019s proxy solicitation agent in connection\nwith the merger, toll free at 855-305-0857.

            "text": "CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe information included in this proxy statement, together with other statements and information publicly\ndisseminated by CyrusOne, contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A\nof the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended. CyrusOne intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions\nfor forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and includes\nthis statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions.\nIn particular, statements pertaining to CyrusOne\u2019s capital resources, portfolio performance, financial\ncondition and results of operations contain certain forward-looking statements. Likewise, all of CyrusOne\u2019s\nstatements regarding anticipated growth in CyrusOne\u2019s funds from operations and anticipated market\nconditions, demographics and results of operations are forward-looking statements. You can identify\nforward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d,\n\u201cwill\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cseeks\u201d, \u201capproximately\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d, \u201cestimates\u201d or \u201canticipates\u201d or the negative\nof these words and phrases or similar words or phrases that are predictions of or indicate future events or\ntrends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by\ndiscussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and\nuncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements\ndepend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to\nrealize them. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying\nassumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or\nprojected.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from\nthose set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: (i) CyrusOne\u2019s proposed merger with\nParent may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including the risk that any required regulatory\napprovals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely\naffect CyrusOne or the expected benefits of the proposed merger or that the approval of CyrusOne\u2019s\nstockholders is not obtained\u037e (ii) the

        "Background of the Merger": {
            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger\nagreement. This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among members of the\nBoard, the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s financial advisors or legal advisors, KKR, GIP or any\nother person.\nThe Board and Company management have, from time to time and in concert with financial and legal\nadvisors, evaluated a range of financial and strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions,\ndivestitures, joint ventures, business combinations and other similar transactions, as well as the possibility\nof obtaining capital investments from third parties to fund the Company\u2019s significant capital needs. These\nevaluations have focused on, among other things, the business environment facing data center operators, as\nwell as conditions and trends in the industry, including consolidation, and included discussions as to\nwhether the Company should continue to execute on its strategy as a stand-alone public company, pursue\nvarious transformative acquisitions or pursue a sale of all or a portion of the Company. As a result, since the\nCompany\u2019s initial public offering in 2013, representatives of the Company and its financial and legal advisors\nhave from time to time engaged in discussions with representatives of other companies, and their financial\nand legal advisors, in, or interested in, the data center industry, as well as financial sponsors, including KKR\nand GIP, regarding such opportunities.\nIn mid-March and early-April 2019, the Company received two unsolicited letters from one of its competitors\nthat we refer to as \u201cParty A\u201d, which included a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company in an all-stock\ntransaction at an exchange ratio that implied a value of approximately $64.62 per share of common stock at\nthe time of the second letter, subject to the completion of due diligence, the negotiation of definitive\ntransaction agreements and several other conditions. The Board, together with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n(\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d), the Company\u2019s financial advisor, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (\u201cCravath\u201d), the\nCompany\u2019s legal advisor, carefully evaluated Party A\u2019s proposal and began a formal process to further\nexplore Party A\u2019s proposal, to solicit proposals from other potential acquirors and to compare each of the\nCompany\u2019s strategic alternatives with its stand-alone plan.\nBetween April and mid-August 2019, the Company, with assistance from its financial and legal advisors,\nprepared a substantial electronic data room and a management presentation to facilitate potential acquirors\u2019\ndue diligence, and contacted over 15 potential acquirors. As a result of these discussions, the Company\nexecuted non-disclosure agreements with 11 potential acquirors, including KKR, Party A, a financial sponsor\nwith a significant infrastructure portfolio that we refer to as \u201cParty B\u201d, a financial sponsor with significant\ninfrastructure and real estate portfolios that we refer to as \u201cParty C\u201d, a financial sponsor with significant\ninfrastructure and real estate portfolios that we refer to as \u201cParty D\u201d, a financial sponsor with significant\ninfrastructure and real estate portfolios that we refer to as \u201cParty E\u201d, a competitor that we refer to as \u201cParty\nF\u201d and four others, and the Company facilitated due diligence and engaged in discussions regarding a\npotential transaction with each of those 11 parties.\nIn July and August 2019, the Company received initial non-binding indications of interest to acquire the\nCompany from (1) KKR, which was at that time joint-bidding with a financial sponsor that we refer to as\n\u201cParty G\u201d, (2) Party E and (3) Party A.\n31 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn August and September 2019, the Company consented to a request from KKR and Party G to add Party B\nand a pension fund that we refer to as \u201cParty H\u201d to its joint-bidding consortium, and the Company\nconsented to a request from Party E to joint-bid with a digital infrastructure fund that we refer to as \u201cParty I\u201d.\nAlso in August and September 2019, Bloomberg and several other media sources published a series of\narticles speculating about a potential sale of the Company.\nOn August 28, 2019, at the direction of the Company, Morgan Stanley sent a process letter to each of the\npotential acquirors in the process at that time, requesting a final bid by September 30, 2019. On September 10,\n2019, Cravath provided to those potential acquirors a draft form of a merger agreement.\nBetween September 13, 2019 and September 24, 2019, Party C, Party A and the joint-bidding consortium\nconsisting of Party E and Party I each affirmatively withdrew from the process, in each case, expressing a\nview that they were unlikely to be able to submit a bid at a valuation that would be attractive to the Company\nand its stockholders. On September 26, 2019, the joint-bidding consortium consisting of KKR, Party G, Party\nB and Party H indicated that it did not expect to be able to submit a bid by the deadline and that its bid, if\nany, would likely be lower than the then-current trading price of the common stock.\nAs of the final bid deadline on September 30, 2019, none of the potential bidders submitted a bid letter or any\ncomments on the draft merger agreement. The Board determined that, while it would remain open to any\npotential strategic alternatives that enhance stockholder value, in the absence of any actionable bids\nfollowing an extensive process, at that time, it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders\nto end the formal process of exploring a potential sale transaction and instead focus on executing its\nstrategic plan as a stand-alone public company.\nThe Company regularly engages with its stockholders on a range of topics that are important to the\nCompany and its stockholders. During the course of 2021, members of Company management and certain\nmembers of the Board had discussions with certain stockholders in which those stockholders encouraged\nthe Company to explore whether a change-of-control transaction would be in the best interests of the\nCompany and its stockholders.\nIn April 2021, the Company engaged DH Capital, LLC (\u201cDH Capital\u201d) to serve as financial advisor in\nconnection with the potential divestiture of certain Company assets, including a potential sale of certain data\ncenters in certain metropolitan areas.\nIn May 2021, Bruce W. Duncan, the Company\u2019s then President and Chief Executive Officer, met with a senior\nexecutive of Party I at the request of the Party I senior executive. They primarily discussed industry trends\nand their respective businesses. At the end of the meeting, the Party I senior executive asked Mr. Duncan\nwhether the Company had any unfulfilled capital needs or whether there were any other ways in which Party\nI may be able to work with the Company. Mr. Duncan indicated that the Company was focused on executing\nits strategic plan and that additional capital was not needed at that time.\nOn July 29, 2021, the Company separated with Mr. Duncan as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the\nCompany, and he resigned from the Board, and David Ferdman, a director on the Board, was appointed\nInterim President and Chief Executive Officer.\nOn August 11, 2021, Party I submitted an unsolicited, preliminary, non-binding indication of interest letter to\nthe Board proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock at a price of $80.00 in cash per\nshare, subject to the completion of due diligence, negotiation of definitive transaction documents,\ninvestment committee approval and other conditions. In its letter, Party I requested that the Company enter\ninto a 30-day exclusivity agreement.\nAlso on August 11, 2021, Mr. Ferdman met with representatives of Party C to engage in preliminary\ndiscussions with respect to a potential joint venture relating to certain of the parties\u2019 respective digital\ninfrastructure assets located in Europe and Asia. Mr. Ferdman indicated to representatives of Party C that\nthe Company was likely not interested in pursuing such a joint venture transaction with Party C at that time,\nand Mr. Ferdman inquired if Party C had interest in a more significant strategic transaction.\n32 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 11 and 12, 2021, certain directors, together with members of Company management and\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath, met to discuss the proposal from Party I and the\ndiscussions with Party C.\nOn August 17, 2021, the Board, together with members of Company management and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley and Cravath, met to consider the proposal from Party I and the possibility of initiating a\nprocess to explore strategic alternatives with other parties. The Board considered the risks to the Company\nand its business inherent in a potential sale process, including: distraction in operating the business\u037e\npotential market leaks and rumors\u037e potential stock price volatility\u037e potential disruption of existing customer\nrelationships\u037e potential loss of prospective customer deals in the pipeline\u037e and potential challenges relating\nto employee retention. The Board further considered all of the information gathered during, and effects\nresulting from, the 2019 process described above. The Board also considered the relatively limited universe\nof potential acquirors that would have strategic interest in acquiring the Company and the financial ability to\ndo so. Following these discussions, the Board determined that a review of the Company\u2019s strategic\nalternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, was in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders, but that it would be necessary to manage discussions with any potential transaction\ncounterparties in a manner that would minimize the potential negative impacts on the Company if a\ntransaction did not occur, while also maximizing stockholder value in the event that a transaction did occur.\nThe Board also concluded that, while Party I\u2019s proposal was not sufficiently compelling to grant Party I\nexclusivity at that time, the Company would offer to sign a non-disclosure agreement with Party I to facilitate\na limited period of due diligence to allow Party I an opportunity to further clarify and improve its proposal.\nThe Board determined to defer any outreach to other new potential bidders until after receiving Party I\u2019s\nupdated proposal, recognizing that recent discussions with Party C were also ongoing. The Board also\nformed a working group of the Board (the \u201cCommittee\u201d), composed of Lynn A. Wentworth, Chair of the\nBoard, Alex Shumate, Lead Independent Director, Mr. Ferdman, Denise Olsen and William E. Sullivan, to meet\nregularly with the Company\u2019s management and financial and legal advisors and further facilitate the Board\u2019s\nday-to-day oversight of the process.\nOn August 18, 2021, the Board met, together with members of Company management, to consider various\npotential financial advisors, and the Board authorized the Company to engage Morgan Stanley and DH\nCapital.\nOn August 19, 2021, the Company formally engaged Morgan Stanley as financial advisor in connection with\nthe exploration of strategic alternatives and the potential execution of one or more transactions in\nconnection with such review, based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s experience in similar transactions, including those\nin the data center industry, and familiarity with the Company.\nAlso on August 19, 2021, representatives of Party B initiated discussions with representatives of Morgan\nStanley and indicated their interest in an acquisition of certain of the Company\u2019s data center assets located\nin Europe.

Party I indicated that the Company\u2019s proposed process\nand timeline were acceptable.\nOn August 20, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to review the recent discussions with Party I, Party B and Party C\nand to review the Company\u2019s strategic plan, including its current five-year financial forecasts (the \u201cFinancial\nForecasts\u201d, as described further in the section entitled \u201c- Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 45).\nOn August 24, 2021, the Company formally amended its engagement letter with DH Capital to include serving\nas a financial advisor in connection with the exploration of strategic alternatives and the potential execution\nof one or more transactions in connection with such review, based on DH Capital\u2019s knowledge of\n33 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Company\u2019s assets and the potential interaction between such review and any potential divestiture of\ncertain data centers in certain metropolitan areas.\nOn August 26, 2021, the Company and Party I executed a non-disclosure agreement with a customary\nstandstill provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a definitive\nacquisition agreement with a third party and other customary provisions.

The Board reviewed the terms of the letter\nfrom KKR and Party B, and representatives of Morgan Stanley provided updates on discussions with Party I\nand Party C. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also discussed its preliminary financial analyses on a\npotential valuation of the common stock based on the Financial Forecasts. DH Capital also presented on the\neffect certain potential substantial customer contracts may have on the future financial performance of the\nCompany. The Board directed Company management and the Company\u2019s financial and legal advisors to\nfacilitate further due diligence with KKR and Party B pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement.\nOn September 20, 2021 and September 21, 2021, KKR and Party B, respectively, executed separate non-\ndisclosure agreements with customary standstill provisions that would automatically terminate upon the\nentry by the Company into a definitive acquisition agreement with a third party and other customary\nprovisions. Thereafter, KKR and Party B and their respective representatives were granted access to the data\nroom.\nDuring the week of September 20, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley periodically engaged with\nrepresentatives of KKR and Party B, Party I and Party C to receive updates on the status of their respective\ndue diligence processes. Party I confirmed that it was continuing to review the materials that were posted in\nthe data room, and that it anticipated it would provide a revised acquisition proposal upon conclusion of its\npreliminary due diligence review, but an increase (if any) in the $80.00 in cash per share initial offer in its\nAugust 11 letter was likely to be minimal. Party C indicated that it was continuing to evaluate the merits of a\nproposed transaction on the basis of publicly available information. Mr. Ferdman and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley canceled the dinner with the Chief Executive Officer of Party C that had been previously\nscheduled for September 21, 2021 as Party C continued its evaluation of the Company.\nOn September 20, 2021, Party J indicated to a representative of Morgan Stanley that it was interested in\ncertain Company assets for a site-level joint venture or outright purchase, and stated that it was also open to\nconsidering an acquisition of the Company.\nOn September 24, 2021, Party J and a representative of Morgan Stanley discussed the potential for an\nacquisition of the Company, but Party J stated that it needed to evaluate its financial capacity to effect any\nsignificant transaction. Party J did not subsequently reengage with Morgan Stanley or the Company.\nAlso on September 24, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives\nof Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to discuss the process.\nOn September 25, 2021, representatives of Party I contacted Morgan Stanley to inform them that it had\ncompleted its preliminary due diligence and that, while Party I remained interested in acquiring the Company,\nit was reducing its proposed purchase price from $80.00 in cash per share of common stock to $77.00 in cash\nper share. In response, the Company revoked Party I\u2019s access to the data room.\nOn September 28, 2021, market speculation regarding the Company\u2019s ongoing review of strategic\nalternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, and the engagement of Morgan Stanley as financial\nadvisor in connection with such review, was published in the financial press. As a result, a number of\nfinancial sponsors and potential strategic buyers reached out to Morgan Stanley and the Company over the\ncourse of the week, indicating their potential interest in conducting due diligence or exploring an acquisition\nof the Company or certain of its assets.\nDuring the period beginning on September 28, 2021 and ending on October 1, 2021, representatives of 14\npotential counterparties with varying levels of financial capabilities, consisting of infrastructure funds,\nstrategic buyers, REITs and private equity firms, including Party A, reached out to Morgan Stanley to\ndiscuss a potential acquisition of the Company or certain of its assets. The Company and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley considered the inbound messages and evaluated the potential counterparties\u2019 respective\nfinancial ability, the type of transaction proposed and other relevant factors. Based on those discussions\nand considerations and at the direction of the Company, representatives of Morgan Stanley had numerous\ndiscussions with potential counterparties and encouraged them to submit written proposals indicating their\ninterest in a transaction, including a proposed purchase price and transaction structure. None of these\npotential counterparties ultimately submitted any written proposal to acquire the Company or any of its\n35 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nassets. Representatives of Party A verbally confirmed to representatives of Morgan Stanley that they were\nnot interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of the Company.\nOn September 28, 2021, the Committee met with representatives of Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath\nand discussed whether to have Morgan Stanley contact other potential counterparties to gauge their interest\nin exploring a potential transaction with the Company. As part of this discussion, representatives of Morgan\nStanley provided the Committee with its views as to the potential counterparties that would likely have both\nthe interest and financial capability to acquire the Company. As part of the foregoing, representatives of\nMorgan Stanley identified certain infrastructure funds and private equity firms, as well as other third-party\ncapital providers and potential transaction counterparties that had expressed interest in acquiring the\nCompany during the 2019 process described above. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Committee\nauthorized the Company\u2019s management and Morgan Stanley to initiate contact with GIP, Party D, Party F and\nParty E regarding a potential transaction.\nIn the days following the Committee meeting on September 28, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley\nreached out to those four additional potential counterparties to solicit their interest in submitting a bid to\nacquire the Company. Representatives of Party D and Party F expressed preliminary interest in re-exploring a\npotential transaction, but were reluctant to submit an indication of interest letter based only on publicly\navailable information\u037e accordingly, on October 3, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of\nMorgan Stanley provided separate draft non-disclosure agreements to Party D and Party F. Over the course\nof the following days, the Company and Party D and their respective representatives negotiated a form of\nnon-disclosure agreement, but Party D ultimately declined to execute the non-disclosure agreement and did\nnot submit a written acquisition proposal.

that are a result of employment and compensation\narrangements with the Company, as described more fully below in the section entitled \u201c- Interests of the\nCompany\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d.\nThe foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather\nincludes the material factors considered by the Board.

In view of the wide variety of\nfactors considered by the Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these\nmatters, the Board did not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign\nrelative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make\nany specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was\nfavorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Board. Rather, the Board made its\nrecommendation based on the totality of the information available to the Board, including discussions with,\nand questioning of, the Company\u2019s management and its financial and legal advisors. In considering the\nfactors discussed above, individual members of the Board may have given different weights to different\nfactors.\nThis explanation of the Board\u2019s reasons for its recommendations and other information presented in this\nsection is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors described in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d\nbeginning on page 20.",

A summary of this information is presented below.\nWhile the Financial Forecasts were prepared in good faith, no assurances can be made regarding future\nevents and the estimates and assumptions underlying these financial forecasts involve judgments with\nrespect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and\nfuture business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business,\neconomic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the\ninherent uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industries in which the Company\noperates, and the risk and uncertainties described under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d beginning on page 20, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are\noutside the control of the Company and, upon consummation of the merger, will be beyond the control of\nKKR or GIP and the surviving corporation. The Company\u2019s stockholders are urged to review the Company\u2019s\nSEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to the Company\u2019s business. There can be no\nassurance that the underlying assumptions will prove to be accurate or that the projected results will be\nrealized. Actual results likely will differ, and may differ materially, from those reflected in the Financial\nForecasts, whether or not the merger is consummated. The inclusion in this proxy statement of the Financial\nForecasts below should not be regarded as an indication that the Company, KKR and GIP, their respective\nboards of directors or their respective financial advisors considered, or now consider, these forecasts to be a\nreliable predictor of future results. The Financial Forecasts are not fact, and neither they nor any underlying\nassumptions should be relied upon as being indicative of future results. Readers of this proxy statement are\ncautioned not to place reliance on this information. The Financial Forecasts assume that the Company would\ncontinue to operate as a standalone company and do not reflect any impact of the merger.\nThe Financial Forecasts include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Net Operating Income,\nAdjusted EBITDA and Normalized FFO (in each case, as defined below). The Company\u2019s management\nincluded forecasts of Net Operating Income in the Financial Forecasts because it is a financial measure\ncommonly used in the REIT industry, as a supplemental performance measure\u037e when compared period over\nperiod, it captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating expenses. The Company\u2019s\nmanagement also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, Net Operating\nIncome is used by investors as a basis to evaluate REITs. The Company\u2019s management included forecasts of\nAdjusted EBITDA in the Financial Forecasts because the Company\u2019s management believes that Adjusted\nEBITDA can be used by investors as a basis to compare the Company\u2019s operating performance with that of\nother companies. The Company\u2019s management included forecasts of Normalized FFO in the Financial\nForecasts because the Company\u2019s management believes that it is a financial measure commonly used in the\nREIT industry, as a supplemental performance measure\u037e when compared period over period, this measure\ncaptures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating expenses. The Company\u2019s management also\nbelieves that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, Normalized FFO is used by\ninvestors as a basis to evaluate REITs.\nInvestors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement are\nnot prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and do not reflect all of the\namounts associated with the Company\u2019s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nInvestors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement have\nno standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors.\n46 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBecause of the non-standardized definitions, the non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently\nfrom, and will not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by the Company\u2019s competitors\nand other REITs, or any similarly titled measures used by KKR or GIP.\nDue to the inherent limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider non-GAAP\nmeasures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial\nperformance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The footnotes to the tables below provide certain\nsupplemental information with respect to the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures. All of the\nfinancial forecasts summarized in this section were prepared by the Company\u2019s management. Neither Deloitte\n& Touche LLP (\u201cDeloitte\u201d), the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other\nindependent registered public accounting firm nor any other person has examined, compiled or otherwise\nperformed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained in these financial\nforecasts and, accordingly, neither Deloitte nor any other independent registered public accounting firm has\nexpressed any opinion or given any other form of assurance with respect thereto and no independent\nregistered public accounting firm assumes any responsibility for the prospective financial information. The\nDeloitte reports incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relate to the historical financial information\nof the Company. Those reports do not extend to the Financial Forecasts and should not be read to do so.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in the Financial Forecasts were relied upon by Morgan Stanley\nfor its financial analysis in connection with the preparation of its opinion and by the Board for its\nconsideration of the merger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor in connection with a\nbusiness combination transaction are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to, nor relied upon by,\nMorgan Stanley or by the Board. In addition, none of KKR, GIP or the other potentially interested parties\nthat received the Financial Forecasts were provided with any such reconciliation. Accordingly, we have not\nprovided a reconciliation of the financial measures in this proxy statement.\nBy including in this proxy statement the Financial Forecasts below, none of the Company, KKR, GIP or any\nof their respective representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the\nultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the Financial Forecasts.\nAccordingly, the Financial Forecasts should not be construed as financial guidance, nor relied upon as such,\nand the Financial Forecasts may differ in important respects from the 2021 earnings guidance, which are\npresented as a range and which the Company\u2019s management prepared based on a different set of\nassumptions. The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in this proxy statement does not constitute an\nadmission or representation by the Company that the information contained therein is material. The Financial\nForecasts summarized in this section reflected the opinions, estimates and judgments of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement at the time they were prepared and have not been updated to reflect any changes since such\nFinancial Forecasts were prepared. None of the Company, KKR, GIP or, after consummation of the merger, the\nsurviving corporation, undertakes any obligation, except as required by law, to update or otherwise revise\nthe Financial Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing since their preparation, changes in general economic\nor industry conditions or the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the\nunderlying assumptions are shown to be in error.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the financial projections made available to the Board, the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors and certain parties potentially interested in a transaction with the Company,\nincluding KKR and GIP (the \u201cFinancial Forecasts\u201d)\u037e the summary of the Financial Forecasts is not included\nin this proxy statement to induce any CyrusOne stockholder to vote in favor of the approval of the merger\nproposal or any other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting:\n($ millions)\nFiscal Year ending December 31,\n2021E\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\nRevenue\n$ 1,124\n$ 1,285\n$ 1,455\n$ 1,615\n$ 1,799\nNet Operating Income\n$\n667\n$\n754\n$\n855\n$\n947\n$ 1,052\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n582\n$\n667\n$\n765\n$\n855\n$\n958\nNormalized FFO\n$\n491\n$\n564\n$\n646\n$\n717\n$\n801\n47 \n(1)\n(2)\n(3)",

As part of this engagement, the\nBoard requested that Morgan Stanley evaluate the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger\nconsideration to be received by the holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.\nOn November 14, 2021, Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently\nconfirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated November 14, 2021, and that is attached to this proxy\nstatement as Annex B, that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review\nundertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of\nshares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the\nholders of shares of common stock.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated November 14, 2021, is attached as Annex B to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.

In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the\nmerger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without any\nwaiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent would\nobtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the commitment letters, and that the definitive\nmerger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley.\nMorgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or\nother approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or\nrestrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits\nexpected to be derived in the proposed merger.

Morgan Stanley was\nadvised by the Company that the Company has operated in conformity with the requirements for\n49 \n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nqualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes since its formation as a REIT and Morgan\nStanley assumed that the merger would not adversely affect such status or operations of the Company.\nMorgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the\nCompany, and was not furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was\nnecessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information\nmade available to Morgan Stanley as of November 14, 2021. Events occurring after such date may affect\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume\nany obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection\nwith its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter to the Board dated November 14, 2021.\nThe following summary is not a complete description of the opinion or the financial analyses performed and\nfactors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, nor does the order of\nanalyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses.\nSome of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to\nfully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the\ntext of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.\nThe analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion\nof such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a\nmisleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion. Furthermore,\nmathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of\nusing the data referred to below.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used and\nrelied upon the Financial Forecasts, as described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201c- Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 45, and certain financial forecasts based on Wall Street\nresearch.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the Company, which is designed to provide\nan implied value of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash\nflows and the terminal value of the company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of per share equity values\nas of September 30, 2021 for the shares of common stock. Morgan Stanley used estimates from the Financial\nForecasts for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flows for the stub period of the fiscal year\n2021 and fiscal years 2022 through 2024 (the \u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow\u201d), which it calculated by deducting\nfrom Adjusted EBITDA for each such fiscal year (as set forth in greater detail in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c- Financial Forecasts\u201d) stock-based compensation expense, net working capital and net\ncapital expenditures and making certain further investment adjustments (including for certain categories of\ncash and bonus compensation, income tax benefit, professional fees, other income and special items). The\nestimates of Unlevered Free Cash Flow were based on the Financial Forecasts (prorated in the case of the\nstub fiscal year 2021), and were as follows:\n($ millions)\nFiscal Year ending December 31,\n2021E\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow\n$ (43\n$(1,026\n$(800\n$(471\nFor the period from September 30, 2021 through December 31, 2021.\nMorgan Stanley also calculated a range of implied terminal enterprise values of the Company as of December\n31, 2024 by applying a range of implied exit multiples of 19.0x to 21.0x to the forecasted Adjusted EBITDA of\nthe Company for the twelve months ending December 31, 2025 with a midpoint of 20.0x at\n50 \n)(1)\n)\n)\n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexit. The range of multiples was selected, based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience\nwith respect to valuations of these types of businesses, using the historical trading performance of the\nCompany relative to select public peers.\nMorgan Stanley then discounted the estimated Unlevered Free Cash Flow and range of estimated terminal\nvalues derived to present value as of September 30, 2021, using rates based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s judgment\nof the estimated range of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital of 5.6% to 6.4%, to derive ranges\nof implied enterprise values for the Company. From the ranges of implied enterprise values, Morgan Stanley\nthen deducted the Company\u2019s net debt of approximately $2.96 billion as of September 30, 2021, and added the\nvalue of certain equity investments of the Company of approximately $30 million as of September 30, 2021, to\narrive at a range of enterprise values for the Company, and subsequently derive a range of implied equity\nvalue in respect of the fully diluted share count as of September 30, 2021.\nThis analysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference range for shares of common stock of\n$74.99-$89.71 (as compared to the proposed merger consideration of $90.50 per share of common stock).\nTrading Performance\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the historical trading range of shares of common stock for the 12-month period\nending September 27, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to published market speculation regarding a\npotential sale of the Company). Morgan Stanley noted that the low and high closing prices for shares of\ncommon stock during such period were $61.64, on March 4, 2021, and $82.69, on June 10, 2021, respectively,\nper share.\nAnalysts\u2019 Price Target Analysis\nMorgan Stanley reviewed publicly available price targets for shares of common stock prepared and\npublished by over 20 equity research analysts. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for shares of\ncommon stock was $70.00 to $90.00, with a median price target of $80.50 per share of common stock, as of\nSeptember 27, 2021, to which Morgan Stanley applied a discount using cost of equity of 7.4% based on the\naverage of (a) the capital asset pricing based cost of equity using a risk premium assumption of 6.0% and\napplicable predicted beta according to MSCI\u2019s Barra\u2019s Risk Models and (b) the median broker reported cost\nof equity of 7.5%, resulting in a discounted price target range of $65.99 to $84.84, with a median price target\nof $74.94 per share of common stock and a mean price target of $74.43 per share of common stock, in each\ncase, based on Capital IQ.\nThe public market trading price targets published by securities research analysts do not necessarily reflect\ncurrent market trading prices for shares of common stock. All estimates are subject to uncertainties,\nincluding, but not limited to, the future financial performance of the Company and future financial market\nconditions.\nNet Asset Value\nMorgan Stanley reviewed publicly available net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) estimates for shares of common stock\npublished by those equity research analysts which published publicly available price targets for shares of\ncommon stock. As of September 27, 2021, the range of NAV estimates per share of common stock ranged\nfrom $59.00 to $92.60, with a median NAV estimate of $68.26 per share of common stock and a mean NAV\nestimate of $68.69 per share of common stock, in each case based on Capital IQ.\nComparative Public Trading Multiples Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading multiples analysis, which is designed to provide an implied\ntrading value of a company by comparing it to selected companies with similar characteristics to the\ncompany. Morgan Stanley compared certain financial information of the Company with publicly available\ninformation for the selected companies.\nMorgan Stanley selected these companies based on its professional judgment and because they are data\ncenter companies with business characteristics that, for purposes of its analysis, Morgan Stanley considered\nsimilar to the business characteristics of the Company.\n51 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe selected companies consisted of:\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR)\u037e\nEquinix, Inc. (EQIX)\u037e\nCoreSite Realty Corporation (COR)\u037e and\nSwitch Inc. (SWCH).\nMarket data for the selected companies was based on closing prices as of November 5, 2021. Balance sheet\ndata for the selected companies was as of the quarter ended September 30, 2021.\nFor purposes of this analysis, for each of the selected companies and the Company, Morgan Stanley\ncalculated:\nthe aggregate value for each such company (obtained by calculating the sum of equity market\ncapitalization of such company plus the net debt of such company and other applicable adjustments\nsuch as adjustments for preferred stock and minority interests) as a multiple of its estimated calendar\nyear 2022 EBITDA (based on Capital IQ consensus estimates) (referred to as \u201cAV / 2022E EBITDA\u201d)\u037e\nand\nthe price per share for each such company a multiple of its estimated calendar year 2022 funds from\noperations per share (based on Capital IQ consensus estimates) (referred to as \u201cP / 2022E FFO\u201d).\nBased on the analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the selected companies (excluding Equinix, Inc. from\nthe selected company averages given the difference in its scale and business mix), Morgan Stanley adjusted\nthe peer multiple range based on the Company\u2019s historical discount to peers and applied the relevant\nadjusted multiples to the relevant 2022 metric based on the estimates prepared by Company management and\ndescribed in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c- Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning\non page 45 to determine the implied price per share of common stock. For the Company, Morgan Stanley\ncalculated the same ratios, using both the estimates prepared by Company management and described in\nfurther detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c- Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 45\nand consensus estimates from Capital IQ as of September 27, 2021.\nThe results of its analysis were as follows:\nValuation Methodology\nSelected \nCompany\nAverage\nApplied\nMultiple\nImplied Price Per\nShare of \nCommon Stock\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nAV / 2022E EBITDA\n24.4x\n19.0x\n21.0x\n$ 74.40\n$\n84.58\nP / 2022E FFO\n24.1x\n16.0x\n20.0x\n$ 67.89\n$\n84.86\nNo company in the public trading multiples analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected\ncompanies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic\nand market conditions affecting the selected companies and other matters (many of which are beyond the\ncontrol of the Company), as well as differences in the selected companies\u2019 financial, business and operating\ncharacteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather,\nthis analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the\nrelative values of the selected companies and the multiples derived from the selected companies.\nMathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using\nthe data of the selected companies.\nPrecedent Transaction Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis on the Company, which is designed to imply a\nvalue of a company based on publicly available financial terms and premiums of selected transactions.\nPrecedent Premiums Paid Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of selected public company\nprecedent transactions announced from October 23, 2013 to June 7, 2021, in which the targets were REITs\n52 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor digital infrastructure companies and the aggregate value of such transactions exceeded $8 billion. All\ntransactions that Morgan Stanley found that satisfied the foregoing criteria were included in the premiums\npaid analysis.\nDigital Infrastructure Precedents\nTransaction Announcement Date\nAcquiror\nTarget\nJune 7, 2021\nBlackstone REIT Operating\nPartnership\u037e The Blackstone\nGroup Inc.\nQTS Realty Trust, Inc.\nOctober 29, 2019\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc.\nInterXion Holding N.V.\nMay 8, 2019\nDigital Colony Partners / EQT\nInfrastructure IV Fund\nZayo Group Holdings, Inc.\nREIT Precedents\nTransaction Announcement Date\nAcquiror\nTarget\nApril 29, 2021\nRealty Income Corporation\nVEREIT, Inc.\nOctober 27, 2019\nPrologis, L.P.\nLiberty Property Trust\nJuly 31, 2018\nBrookfield Asset Management\nInc.\nForest City Realty Trust, Inc.\nApril 29, 2018\nPrologis, Inc.\nDCT Industrial Trust Inc.\nNovember 13, 2017\nBrookfield Property Partners L.P.\nGGP Inc.

(nka: VEREIT,\nInc.)\nCole Real Estate Investments, Inc.\nMorgan Stanley calculated the premiums paid in these transactions over the applicable unaffected stock\nprice of the acquired company (i.e., the percentage by which the price that the acquiring entity paid for the\nshares of the target exceeded the unaffected market price of such shares), by comparing the publicly\nannounced purchase price to the volume-weighted average price for the ten trading days ending five trading\ndays prior to the announcement of such precedent transactions (or the unaffected date, if applicable).\nMorgan Stanley noted that the mean of the premiums paid in the digital infrastructure transaction precedents\nwas 17.7%. Morgan Stanley noted that the mean of the premiums paid in the REIT transaction precedents\nwas 20.5%.\nBased on the results of this analysis and the premiums paid in precedent transactions as outlined above,\nMorgan Stanley applied a premium range of 14.0% to 28.5% based on the observed low and high end of the\nrange of premiums paid in such precedent transactions, respectively, to the closing price of shares of\ncommon stock on September 27, 2021, the last full trading day prior to published market speculation\nregarding a potential sale of the Company, of $72.57. This analysis indicated an implied per share equity\nvalue reference range for common stock of $82.73 to $93.25.\nPrecedent Data Center Transactions Analysis\nMorgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for certain precedent transactions involving data\ncenter operators, selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, between\nJanuary 1, 2015 and November 14, 2021. Morgan Stanley selected such comparable transactions because it\ndetermined, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, that they shared certain\ncharacteristics with the merger. The following is a list of the transactions reviewed:\n53 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Transactions (Acquiror / Target)\nBlackstone REIT Operating Partnership\u037e The Blackstone Group Inc. / QTS Realty Trust, Inc. \nEQT Infrastructure IV Fund / EdgeConneX, Inc. \nMacquarie Asia Infrastructure Fund 2 / AirTrunk Operating Pty Ltd \nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. / InterXion Holding N.V. \nDigital Realty Trust, Inc., Brookfield Infrastructure / Ascenty LLC \nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. / DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc. \nEquinix, Inc. / 29 Data Centers owned by Verizon Communications Inc.\nBC Partners, Longview Asset Management and Medina Capital / Data Centers and Colocation Business of\nCenturyLink, Inc. \nEquinix, Inc. / Telecity Group plc\nFor each selected precedent transaction, where such information was available, Morgan Stanley reviewed\ntransaction values and calculated the total enterprise value implied for each target company (based on the\nconsideration paid or proposed to be paid in the selected transaction), as a multiple of the target company\u2019s\n(A) last 12 months (\u201cLTM,\u201d for the prior 12-month period, measured from the transaction announcement date,\nfor which publicly available information was available) Adjusted EBITDA and (B) next 12 months (\u201cNTM,\u201d\nestimated for the next 12-month period measured from the transaction announcement date) Adjusted\nEBITDA. Financial data of the selected precedent transactions were based on Capital IQ consensus\nestimates, public filings and other publicly available information.\nFrom these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted an average NTM EBITDA multiple of 20.7x and an average\nLTM EBITDA multiple of 19.9x. Morgan Stanley, based on its professional judgment and experience,\nidentified the following three precedent transactions as being most relevant to the transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement:\nSelected Transactions (Acquiror / Target)\nBlackstone REIT Operating Partnership\u037e The Blackstone Group Inc. / QTS Realty Trust, Inc. \nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. / InterXion Holding N.V. \nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. / DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc.\nApplying the LTM EBITDA multiple from those transactions to the Company\u2019s LTM Adjusted EBITDA\nindicated an implied per share equity value reference range for common stock of $77.29 to $97.04.\nNo company or transaction utilized in the precedent transaction analysis is identical to the Company or the\nmerger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect\nto industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other\nmatters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. These include, among other things, the\nimpact of competition on the Company\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the\nabsence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company and the\nindustry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies\nand the aggregate value and equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact\nthat certain points in the range of implied present value per share of common stock derived from the\nvaluation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the merger consideration is not\nnecessarily dispositive to Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis of the merger consideration, but one of many factors\nMorgan Stanley considered.\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the merger for the Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial\nand comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a\ncomplex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving\nat its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any\nportion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the\nprocess underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given\n54 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nvarious analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed\nvarious assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations\nresulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley\u2019s view of\nthe actual value of shares of common stock. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous\nassumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions and other matters which are beyond the control of the Company. Any estimates contained in\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view to the holders of shares of common stock of the consideration to be received by\nholders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, and in connection with the delivery of\nits oral opinion, and its subsequent written opinion, to the Board. These analyses do not purport to be\nappraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of common stock might actually trade.\nThe consideration to be received by holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement\nwas determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent (and including other\nparties as described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-\u200bBackground of the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 31) and was approved by the Board. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the\nBoard during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to the Board,\nnor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration to be received by CyrusOne stockholders\nconstituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the Board when it unanimously (i) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and\nperformance by the Company of the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the merger\nand the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) declared that the merger is advisable\nand in the best interests of the Company and of stockholders of the Company on substantially the terms and\nconditions set forth in the merger agreement, (iii) directed that the merger be submitted for consideration at\nthe special meeting and (iv) recommended that the stockholders of the Company approve the merger (as\ndescribed in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c- Reasons for the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 41). Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as\ndeterminative of the opinion of the Board with respect to the merger consideration or whether the Board\nwould have been willing to agree to a different form or amount of consideration.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other\nprofessionals in accordance with its customary practice. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion or\nrecommendation as to how any stockholder of the Company should vote at the stockholders meeting to be\nheld in connection with the merger.\nMorgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and\nindividual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting,\ntrading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as\nwell as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services.

Based on the Company equity\nawards outstanding as of December 23, 2021 and the other assumptions described above, Ms.\nWentworth and Messrs. Shumate, Gamble and Sullivan each hold Company restricted share awards\nvalued at $184,349, Ms. Olsen holds Company LTIP unit awards valued at $184,349 and Mr. Nielsen\nholds Company LTIP unit awards valued at $331,864.\nIn the case of Company equity awards subject to performance criteria, reflects achievement of such\ncriteria at the maximum level.\nReflects Company equity awards held by Former Executive Officers as a group.\nTreatment of Company ESPP\nFollowing the date of the merger agreement: (i) with respect to any outstanding Purchase Period(s) under the\nCompany ESPP as of such date, no participant can increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll\ndeduction election in effect as of such date for such Purchase Period(s) and no new participants can\nparticipate in such Purchase Period(s)\u037e (ii) no new Purchase Period will commence under the Company ESPP\non or after such date\u037e (iii) any Purchase Period under the Company ESPP that does not end prior to the\neffective time will terminate and a Purchase Date will occur immediately prior to the effective time with\nrespect to such Purchase Period, in which case any shares of common stock purchased pursuant to such\nPurchase Period will be treated the same as all other shares of common stock in the merger\u037e and (iv)\nimmediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of the effective time, the Company ESPP will terminate. To\nthe extent the Company\u2019s executive officers participate in the Company ESPP, they will be treated in the same\nmanner described above.\nSeverance Entitlements\nEmployment Agreement with Mr. Ferdman\nMr. Ferdman is currently subject to an employment agreement with a term that ends on January 29, 2022 (the\n\u201cFerdman Term Date\u201d) and that provides that, if his employment is terminated without \u201cCause\u201d\n60 \n(1)\n(2)\n(2)\n( 3)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor Mr. Ferdman resigns for \u201cGood Reason\u201d  (each, as defined in Mr. Ferdman\u2019s employment agreement) at any\ntime, he will be eligible to receive, subject to Mr. Ferdman\u2019s execution of a release of claims in favor of the\nCompany, (i) full vesting of his Company restricted share award granted to him in his capacity as an\nemployee and (ii) provided that Mr. Ferdman provides transition services to the Company through the\nFerdman Term Date, the base salary and annual bonus that Mr. Ferdman would have otherwise earned\nthrough the Ferdman Term Date if his employment had not terminated. In addition, if Mr. Ferdman\u2019s\nemployment is terminated for any other reason, other than for Cause, he will be entitled to a pro-rated portion\nof any annual bonus he would have otherwise earned through the Ferdman Term Date if his employment had\nnot terminated.\nMr. Ferdman\u2019s employment agreement does not provide for any enhanced payments or benefits in\nconnection with a change in control of the Company such as the merger, but his Company restricted share\naward agreement provides that, in the event that any payment or benefit payable to Mr. Ferdman would\nconstitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201cCode\u201d), then Mr. Ferdman will either receive all such payments and benefits in full or such\npayments and benefits will be reduced to the greatest amount that does not trigger the excise tax pursuant to\nSection 4999 of the Code, whichever results in the greater after-tax amount for Mr. Ferdman (a \u201c280G best-net\ncutback\u201d).\nSeverance Agreements with Ms. Motlagh and Mr. Hatem and Employment Agreement with Mr. Jackson\nMs. Motlagh and Messrs. Jackson and Hatem are each party to an individual agreement with the Company\nthat provides that if the applicable executive\u2019s employment is terminated without \u201cCause\u201d or he or she\nresigns for \u201cGood Reason\u201d  (in the case of Ms. Motlagh and Mr. Hatem) or as a result of a \u201cConstructive\nTermination\u201d  (in the case of Mr. Jackson) (each, as defined in the applicable agreement), in each case, during\nthe one-year period beginning on a \u201cchange in control\u201d of the Company, which will include the\nconsummation of the merger, he or she will be eligible to receive, subject to his or her execution of a release\nof claims in favor of the Company: (i) a cash lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of the executive\u2019s\nbase salary and annual target bonus, increased by an amount equal to the interest that would be earned on\nsuch amounts over a 60-day period, based on an annual interest rate of 3.5%\u037e (ii) accelerated vesting of all\ntime-based equity awards\u037e (iii) continued health benefits for one year (or less, if the executive becomes\neligible for another group health plan), with the Company to pay or reimburse any costs in excess of the\ncurrent active employee rate\u037e and (iv) an additional cash payment sufficient to purchase comparable life\ninsurance coverage for one year. All of the executive agreements provide for a 280G best-net cutback.\nThe severance payments and benefits described above are generally subject to the applicable executive\u2019s\ncompliance with his or her obligations under any restrictive covenant agreement entered into with the\nCompany, which generally provide for one-year post-termination restrictions on competing with the\nCompany, accepting employment with customers or vendors or soliciting the Company\u2019s employees or\ncustomers, and requires the executive to generally not disclose the Company\u2019s confidential information at\nany time.\nArrangements with KKR or GIP\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, none of the Company\u2019s directors or executive officers has entered\ninto any agreement, arrangement or understanding with KKR, GIP, Parent or any of their affiliates regarding\nemployment, or providing for any compensation or benefits, following the effective time, and the merger is\nnot conditioned upon any such agreement, arrangement or understanding being entered into.\nRetention Bonuses\nThe Company has established a cash-based deal retention bonus program for the benefit of certain Company\nemployees in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. Pursuant to the program, Messrs. Ferdman,\nHatem and Jackson and Ms. Motlagh received deal retention bonuses in an amount equal to $4,000,000,\n$1,000,000, $1,000,000 and $500,000, respectively. In the case of Mr. Ferdman, the size of his deal retention\nbonus is reflective, in part, of the fact that the significant majority of his equity awards were scheduled to\nvest in December 2021 and January 2022. Fifty percent of each bonus is payable upon the closing of the\nmerger and the remaining fifty percent will become payable 90 days following the closing of\n61 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe merger, subject to continued employment through the relevant payment date, although payment of the\nsecond installment will also be made upon a termination that would otherwise entitle the recipient to\nseverance compensation.\nContinuing Employee Benefits\nThe merger agreement provides for certain customary protections regarding the compensation and benefits\nof employees of the Company, including the Company\u2019s executive officers, during their employment with the\nCompany and its affiliates following the effective time for a period of up to one year. These provisions are\ndescribed in more detail in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fEmployee Benefits Matters\u201d\nbeginning on page 86.\nTreatment of Annual Bonuses\nThe merger agreement provides that Parent will pay an annual bonus to each Continuing Employee who is\notherwise eligible to receive an annual bonus for the performance year in which the effective time occurs at\nthe same time that such bonuses are paid in the ordinary course of business (the \u201cClosing Year Bonus\u201d). In\nthe event an employee\u2019s, including an executive officer\u2019s, employment is terminated under circumstances\nthat would qualify him or her to receive severance, such employee will receive a pro-rated Closing Year\nBonus based on the greater of (i) the amount such employee would be entitled in connection with the\napplicable severance arrangement and (ii) his or her target annual bonus, except that, if the termination\noccurs during the second half of the Company\u2019s fiscal year, the amount under clause (ii) will be equal to the\nprojected actual annual cash bonus he or she would have received for such fiscal year based on accruals for\nbonuses in the Company\u2019s financial statements, if greater.\nSection 280G Mitigation Actions\nAs described above, all executive officers are subject to a 280G best-net cutback. Based on a preliminary\nanalysis conducted after entering into the merger agreement, Messrs. Ferdman, Hatem and Jackson and Ms.\nMotlagh would each potentially trigger, absent any mitigating actions, the adverse tax consequences\nimposed by Section 280G of the Code in connection with the merger, which consist of a 20% excise tax on\ncertain payments that may be received by the executives, significantly reducing their retentive value to the\nCompany, and the possibility that the Company may lose the benefit of a tax deduction with respect to such\npayments. Therefore, to mitigate the expected impact of Section 280G of the Code, and to preserve the\nretentive value of the executives\u2019 equity and other compensation, as well as the ability of the Company to\npotentially claim a tax deduction in respect of such payments, the following actions were approved in\naccordance with the terms of the merger agreement, effective as of December 20, 2021, in order to increase\neach executive\u2019s threshold for triggering Section 280G of the Code:\naccelerating the payment of a portion of each executive officer\u2019s annual bonus for the 2021\nperformance year that otherwise would be paid in early 2022 ($1,200,000 for Mr. Ferdman, $600,000 for\nMs. Motlagh, $540,000 for Mr. Hatem and $474,000 for Mr. Jackson)\u037e\naccelerating the payment of certain time-vesting restricted shares and RSUs for all executive officers\nother than Mr. Hatem (who does not hold any such awards), which were either scheduled to vest in\napproximately two months or represent a small portion of future equity vestings ($3,177,247 for Mr.\nFerdman, $1,049,236 for Ms. Motlagh and $401,632 for Mr. Jackson, in each case, based on the closing\nprice for shares of common stock on December 20, 2021 of $89.51)\u037e and\nfor Mr. Jackson only, accelerating the payment of performance-vesting RSUs scheduled to vest in\nFebruary 2022 ($1,365,207, based on the closing price for shares of common stock on December 20,\n2021 of $89.51).\nWhere compensation subject to performance conditions was accelerated, the acceleration was based on an\nassumed level of performance that the Company determined was substantially certain to be achieved. If\nactual performance would have resulted in a greater amount being earned, the executive will be entitled to a\ntrue-up once actual performance is determined. All the foregoing actions were made subject to a clawback in\nfavor of the Company, whereby the executive will be required to reimburse the Company if it is subsequently\n62 \n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndetermined that the amounts accelerated would not have been earned (i.e., due to the failure to satisfy any\nservice- or, if applicable, performance-based vesting criteria).\nDirector and Officer Indemnification\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, members of the Board and executive officers of the Company\nwill be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability\ninsurance policies following the merger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the merger\nagreement relating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fIndemnification\u201d beginning on page 86.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company\u2019s\nnamed executive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to\nthe merger for which payment is not conditioned upon a termination or resignation of such executive officer\n(i.e., on a \u201csingle-trigger\u201d basis) or in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following the\nmerger (i.e., on a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d basis). The holders of shares of common stock are being asked to approve,\non a non-binding, advisory basis, such compensation. Because the vote to approve such compensation is\nadvisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, if the merger\nproposal is approved by the holders of shares of common stock and the merger is consummated, the\ncompensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject\nonly to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below and above\nunder \u201c- Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d.\nThe potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K.\nThe estimated values are based on (i) an assumption that the merger is consummated on June 30, 2022, (ii)\nthe per share merger consideration of $90.50, (iii) the named executive officers\u2019 salary and target bonus\namounts as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, (iv) the number of unvested Company equity\nawards held by the named executive officers as of December 23, 2021 (in particular, the amounts below\nexclude awards that vested as a result of the 280G mitigation actions described above), the latest practicable\ndate to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, less any awards expected to vest in\nthe ordinary course prior to June 30, 2022, and assuming no additional grants or forfeitures of Company\nequity awards prior to June 30, 2022, and (v) an assumption that each named executive officer experiences a\ntermination of employment immediately following the consummation of the merger under circumstances that\nentitle such named executive officer to receive severance (i.e., a termination without \u201cCause\u201d or resignation\nfor \u201cGood Reason\u201d). As such, the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that\nmay or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect\ncertain compensation actions that may occur before consummation of the merger. As a result, the actual\namounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth\nbelow.\nThe amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of a\n280G best-net cutback, which all named executive officers are subject to\u037e therefore, actual payments to the\nnamed executive officers may be less than the amounts indicated below.\nPotential Payments to Named Executive Officers\nName\nCash ($)\nEquity ($)\nPerquisites / \nBenefits ($)\nTotal ($)\nDavid Ferdman\n4,000,000\n-\n-\n4,000,000\nKatherine Motlagh\n2,759,485\n2,994,374\n26,099\n5,779,958\nJohn Hatem\n3,033,537\n3,293,476\n24,464\n6,351,477\nRobert Jackson\n2,784,993\n4,659,212\n25,689\n7,469,894\nIn connection with their terminations of employment with the Company, each of Messrs. Duncan and\n63 \n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWojtaszek and Ms. Morefield retained a portion of their Company equity awards that are subject to\nperformance vesting criteria, with vesting subject to the satisfaction of such performance criteria. Based\non the assumptions above, the estimated value of such Company equity awards is $9,611,915 in the\naggregate. Such individuals will not receive any other severance or enhanced benefits in connection\nwith the merger as a result of their status as a former executive officer of the Company. Mr. Durvasula\ndoes not hold any unvested Company equity awards, and therefore will not receive any severance or\nenhanced benefits in connection with the merger as a result of his status as a former executive officer of\nthe Company.\nThe amounts shown in this column represent the estimated value of (i) cash lump sum severance\npayments that would be provided to the named executive officer upon a termination of employment by\nthe Company without \u201cCause\u201d or by the named executive officer for \u201cGood Reason\u201d or as a result of a\n\u201cConstructive Termination\u201d, in each case, within one year following the closing of the merger (as\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201c- Severance Entitlements\u201d), (ii) a pro-rated Closing Year Bonus (as\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201c- Treatment of Annual Bonuses\u201d), which is assumed to be paid based\non target performance and (iii) a cash-based deal retention bonus (as described in the section entitled \u201c-\nRetention Bonuses\u201d). Other than Mr. Ferdman, the value of cash severance for each named executive\nofficer consists of two times the sum of his or her base salary and target bonus amount, increased by\nthe interest, based on a rate of 3.5%, that would be payable over a 60-day period. Half of each named\nexecutive officer\u2019s cash-based deal retention bonus is \u201csingle-trigger\u201d as such amounts will be payable\non the effective time regardless of whether or not the executive\u2019s employment is terminated. Each named\nexecutive officer\u2019s cash severance payments, Closing Year Bonus and the second half of the cash-based\nretention bonus are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d, as such payments will not be payable solely as a result of the\noccurrence of the effective time. In the case of the cash severance and Closing Year Bonus, such\namounts will only be payable in the event of a qualifying termination of employment, subject to the\nterms and conditions described in the section entitled \u201c- Severance Entitlements\u201d. In the case of the\nsecond half of the cash-based retention bonuses, such amounts will be payable 90 days following the\nClosing or upon an earlier termination that would otherwise entitle the recipient to severance\ncompensation, as described in the section entitled \u201c- Retention Bonuses\u201d. Although Mr. Ferdman\u2019s\nemployment agreement provides for certain severance payments as described above in the section\nentitled \u201c- Employment Agreement with Mr. Ferdman\u201d, under the current terms of his employment\nagreement, Mr. Ferdman would not be entitled to any severance if his employment is terminated for any\nreason on or following January 29, 2022. Set forth below are the separate values for the cash severance\npayments, pro-rated Closing Year Bonuses and deal retention bonuses reflected in the table above.\nName\nSeverance\n($)\nPro-Rata Bonus\n($)\nDeal\nRetention \nBonus ($)\nTotal ($)\nDavid Ferdman\n-\n-\n4,000,000\n4,000,000\nKatherine Motlagh\n2,011,540\n247,945\n500,000\n2,759,485\nJohn Hatem\n1,810,386\n223,151\n1,000,000\n3,033,537\nRobert Jackson\n1,589,117\n195,877\n1,000,000\n2,784,993\nThe amounts shown in this column represent the estimated aggregate value of the named executive\nofficers\u2019 unvested Company equity awards.

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders with\nrespect to the disposition of common stock pursuant to the merger. It is not intended to be a complete\nanalysis or description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and does not\naddress consequences to holders of LTIP units or Company equity awards. This discussion is based upon\nthe provisions of the Code and all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Any such changes could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth\nherein. The Internal Revenue Service may not agree with the tax consequences described in this discussion.\nThis discussion assumes that holders of common stock hold their shares as capital assets within the\nmeaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not\naddress all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of common stock in light\nof such holder\u2019s particular circumstances, nor does it discuss the special considerations applicable to\nholders of Common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for\nexample, financial institutions or broker-dealers, mutual funds, partnerships or other pass-through entities\nand their partners or members, tax-exempt organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance\ncompanies, dealers in securities or non-U.S. currencies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market\nmethod of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, U.S.\nexpatriates, holders who acquired their shares of common stock through the exercise of stock options or\notherwise as compensation, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, holders who hold their shares of\ncommon stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as\ndefined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, accrual method holders who prepare an\n\u201capplicable financial statement\u201d  (as defined in Section 451 of the Code) and holders who own or have owned\n(directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or more of the common stock (by vote or value) outstanding. In\naddition, this discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or\nnon-U.S. jurisdiction or U.S. federal non-income tax consequences (e.g., the federal estate or gift tax or the\napplication of the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the Code).\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds common stock,\nthe tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and\nactivities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding common stock, you should consult\nyour own tax advisor.\n65 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAll holders should consult their own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including the\napplication and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for\nshares of common stock pursuant to the merger.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of common stock, that is,\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes:\nan individual citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\na corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)\ncreated or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of\nColumbia\u037e\na trust if (1) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States\nand one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have the\nauthority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in effect under\napplicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes\u037e or\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nA \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or an entity classified as a partnership for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes) of common stock that is not a U.S. holder.\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger and such U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock converted into cash pursuant to the merger. Such gain or\nloss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder\u2019s holding\nperiod for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the merger. Long-term capital gains for certain non-\ncorporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal income\ntaxation. A U.S. holder who has held shares of our common stock for less than six months at the time of the\nmerger, taking into account certain holding period rules and who recognizes a loss on the exchange of such\nshares of common stock in the merger will be treated as recognizing a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany capital gain dividends received from us, or such holder\u2019s share of any designated retained capital gains,\nwith respect to such shares. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
