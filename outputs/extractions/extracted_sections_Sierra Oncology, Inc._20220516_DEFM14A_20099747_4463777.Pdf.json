Under the merger agreement, GSK will acquire Sierra\nOncology for $55.00 in cash per share of our common stock. In order to complete the merger, our stockholders holding a majority of all of our issued\nand outstanding common stock must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.

If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by our stockholders\nand the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into Sierra Oncology,\nwith Sierra Oncology continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger. As a result of the merger, Sierra Oncology will become an indirect\nwholly owned subsidiary of GSK, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the Nasdaq. In addition, our\ncommon stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $55.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each\nshare of our common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal\nrights under the DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied.

The number of shares of our common stock\nissuable for Sierra options subject to performance-based vesting that have performance periods outstanding at the effective time will be deemed to\nbe the number of shares issuable upon satisfaction of maximum achievement of performance criteria. The cash payment amount (less any required\nwithholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable Sierra option holder following the effective time of the merger, in accordance with the\nterms of the merger agreement. Sierra options with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the per share price will be cancelled without\nany cash payment in respect thereof.\nQ:\nWhat am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?\nA:\nYou are being asked to vote on the following proposals:\n\u2022\nto adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Acquisition Sub will merge with and into Sierra Oncology and Sierra Oncology will\nbecome an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GSK\u037e\n\u2022\nto approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named\nexecutive officers in connection with the merger\u037e and\n\u2022\nto approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are\ninsufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\nA:\nThe special meeting will take place on June 29, 2022, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time.

Additionally, the virtual\nnature of the special meeting is generally designed to enable participation of and access by more of our stockholders while decreasing the cost of\nconducting the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a \u201cproxy,\u201d to vote your shares of our common stock. The written document\ndescribing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy\nto vote your shares of our common stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d You may follow the instructions on the proxy card to designate a proxy by\ntelephone or by the Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and returned a proxy card.

Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash\npayment to which you are entitled.

If you sell or\ntransfer your shares of our common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a\nproxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies Sierra Oncology in writing of such\nspecial arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share price with respect to such shares, if the merger is completed, to the person\nto whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or transfer your\nshares of our\n20\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for\nyour convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card).\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nPlease sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for) each proxy card and voting instruction form\nthat you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting\ninstruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than\none brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a\nstockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting\nmaterials that you receive.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nA:\nIf available, Sierra Oncology may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. Sierra Oncology intends to publish\nfinal voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Sierra Oncology files\nwith the SEC are publicly available when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger?\nA:\nIf you are a U.S. Holder, the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of\nour common stock surrendered in the merger.\nA Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of\nthe Merger\u201d) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the merger\nunless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.\nBoth U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders may also potentially be subject to backup withholding tax if they do not provide certain tax certifications,\nas described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the\nMerger\u2014Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.\u201d\nBecause particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances, as well as any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-\nincome tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information purposes only and\ndoes not constitute legal advice to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is\nprovided in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe currently expect to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2022 or before. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all,\ncannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our\ncontrol.\n21\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat governmental and regulatory approvals are required?\nA:\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the merger under the HSR Act has\nexpired or been terminated.\nThe initial waiting period under the HSR Act is set to expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on May 31, 2022.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?\nA:\nIf the merger is consummated, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) continuously hold their\nshares of our common stock through the effective time of the merger\u037e (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares\u037e (4) meet certain other conditions\nand statutory requirements as described in this proxy statement\u037e and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal,\nwill be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders\nwill be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares,\nexclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of\nChancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be\nfair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of\npayment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving\ncorporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the\ndifference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest\ntheretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such\nentry of judgment. Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the\nexercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in\nadditional detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, attached\nas Annex B to this proxy statement.\nQ:\nDo any of Sierra Oncology\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Sierra Oncology stockholders\ngenerally?\nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be\naware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our\nstockholders generally. In: (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement\u037e (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger\u037e and (3)\nunanimously recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Sierra Oncology Board was aware of and considered\nthese interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Sierra Oncology Board, together with Sierra Oncology management, regularly evaluates Sierra Oncology\u2019s business strategy, short-term and\nlong-term business objectives and financial needs with a view towards enhancing stockholder value and furthering Sierra Oncology\u2019s mission to deliver\ntargeted therapies that treat rare forms of cancer. As part of this evaluation, the Sierra Oncology Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of\nstrategic alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) continued investment in the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of\nSierra Oncology\u2019s existing product candidates\u037e (2) opportunities for strategic partnerships, collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with\nthird parties with respect to the development and potential commercialization of product candidates, either by Sierra Oncology with respect to new\nproduct candidates or by third party pharmaceutical companies with respect to Sierra Oncology\u2019s existing product candidates\u037e (3) various capital raising\nalternatives, including private and public equity and debt financing transactions\u037e and (4) various other financial and strategic alternatives, including a\nsale of Sierra Oncology or certain of its assets.\nAs part of its business strategy, Sierra Oncology\u2019s management has from time to time engaged in discussions with participants in the\npharmaceutical industry regarding opportunities for strategic partnerships with respect to the commercialization of momelotinib, in particular in\njurisdictions outside of the United States. Sierra Oncology management regularly updates the Sierra Oncology Board on opportunities and significant\ndiscussions regarding potential strategic partnerships. Sierra Oncology and the counterparties have entered into confidentiality agreements to facilitate\nthese discussions which have not included a \u201cstandstill\u201d or other restriction on the counterparty\u2019s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire\nSierra Oncology.\nIn December 2021, Sierra Oncology engaged Lazard Fr\u00e8res & Co. LLC (which we refer to as \u201cLazard Fr\u00e8res\u201d) and Lazard & Co., Limited (which we\nrefer to collectively with Lazard Fr\u00e8res as \u201cLazard\u201d) for Lazard to act as financial advisory investment banker to Sierra Oncology in connection with the\npossible sale of Sierra Oncology or another possible licensing, partnership or similar transaction involving Sierra Oncology\u2019s product candidates. The\nSierra Oncology Board approved the terms of the engagement. The Sierra Oncology Board determined to engage Lazard as financial advisor in\nconnection with Sierra Oncology\u2019s evaluation of potential strategic alternatives after considering Lazard\u2019s qualifications, independence, expertise,\ninternational reputation, knowledge of the biopharmaceutical industry and experience acting as financial advisor in connection with similar partnership\nand strategic transactions. As part of the Sierra Oncology Board\u2019s evaluation of strategic alternatives, Lazard had previously and from time-to-time\nreviewed with the Sierra Oncology Board its preliminary market and valuation perspectives with respect to Sierra Oncology and the biopharmaceutical\nindustry generally, as well potential counterparties for a partnership or other strategic transaction involving Sierra Oncology.\n34Table of Contents\nIn January 2022, in order to facilitate the Sierra Oncology Board\u2019s assistance and oversight of Sierra Oncology management in connection with the\nevaluation and pursuit of strategic transactions, the Sierra Oncology Board established two separate committees of the Sierra Oncology Board, one to\nreview, evaluate and negotiate, on behalf of the Sierra Oncology Board, potential strategies which could include a merger, sale, business combination or\nother transaction (which we refer to as the \u201cStrategic Transactions Committee\u201d) and another to review, evaluate and negotiate, on behalf of the Sierra\nOncology Board, one or more transactions involving the incurrence of debt and/or sale of equity securities by Sierra Oncology (which we refer to as the\n\u201cFinancing Committee\u201d). The Strategic Transactions Committee and the Financing Committee were formed in light of (1) the potentially significant\nworkload that could be involved in any decision by Sierra Oncology to evaluate applicable strategic or financing transactions\u037e (2) the possibility that\nSierra Oncology management may need feedback and direction on relatively short notice\u037e and (3) the benefits and convenience of having a subset of\ndirectors oversee any process of considering applicable strategic alternatives. Gaurav Aggarwal, Mona Ashiya, Craig Collard, Georgia Erbez and Robert\nPelzer were appointed by the Sierra Oncology Board as members of the Strategic Transactions Committee, and Andrew Allen, Jeffrey Cooper, Christy\nOliger, Josh Richardson (who resigned from the Sierra Oncology Board on March 6, 2022) and Andrew Sinclair were appointed by the Sierra Oncology\nBoard as members of the Financing Committee. The Sierra Oncology Board resolved that it would not effectuate a merger, sale, business combination or\nother transaction if it had not first been approved or recommended by the Strategic Transactions Committee, or effectuate a transaction involving the\nincurrence of debt and/or sale of equity securities by Sierra Oncology if it had not first been approved or recommended by the Financing Committee. It\nwas understood that the full Board would continue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic alternatives. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini\nGoodrich & Rosati, P.C., Sierra Oncology\u2019s outside counsel (which we refer to as \u201cWilson Sonsini\u201d), reviewed with the Sierra Oncology Board its\nfiduciary duties in connection with these matters.\nOn January 25, 2022, Sierra Oncology announced that momelotinib achieved statistically significant benefit on symptoms, anemia and splenic size\nin the pivotal Phase 3 MOMENTUM study for myelofibrosis. Sierra Oncology further noted it planned to submit a New Drug Application (a \u201cNDA\u201d) with\nthe US Food & Drug Administration for momelotinib in the second quarter of 2022.\nAlso on January 25, 2022, Sierra Oncology announced a proposed underwritten public offering of Sierra Oncology common stock and pre-funded\nwarrants that ultimately raised $145.3 million. Sierra Oncology effected the offering to continue financing its preparation for the potential\ncommercialization of momelotinib, clinical development of its other product candidates, research, clinical and process development and manufacturing of\nits product candidates, working capital, and capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\nFollowing the announcement of the MOMENTUM clinical data for momelotinib, Sierra Oncology management met with various participants in the\npharmaceutical industry with which it had been engaged in discussions regarding potential strategic partnerships with respect to the commercialization of\nmomelotinib to update them on the results of the study.\nOn February 17, 2022, Nina Mojas, Senior Vice President of Oncology at GSK, emailed Stephen Dilly, Chief Executive Officer and President at Sierra\nOncology, regarding a potential strategic partnership between GSK and Sierra Oncology.\nOn February 18, 2022, Sierra Oncology and GSK executed a confidentiality agreement to facilitate discussions and information sharing between the\nparties. This agreement did not include a \u201cstandstill\u201d or other restriction on GSK\u2019s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire Sierra Oncology.\nOn February 22, 2022, Dr. Dilly and Ms. Mojas met to discuss Sierra Oncology, momelotinib and opportunities for a potential strategic partnership\nbetween GSK and Sierra Oncology. As part of this discussion, Ms. Mojas inquired as to whether Sierra Oncology was for sale. Dr. Dilly responded that\nSierra Oncology was not seeking a sale transaction at such time. Following the discussion, Ms. Mojas introduced Dr. Dilly to Ian\n35\nTable of Contents\nGreenberg, Vice President & Head of Business Development, Global Pharmaceuticals Commercial Portfolio at GSK, via email, and Dr. Dilly introduced Ms.\nMojas and Mr. Greenberg to Kevin Norrett, Chief Business Officer at Sierra Oncology, via email, to continue discussions regarding a potential strategic\npartnership.\nOn February 23, 2022, Mr. Norrett and Mr. Greenberg met to discuss opportunities for a potential strategic partnership between Sierra Oncology\nand GSK with respect to the commercialization of momelotinib by GSK in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States. In furtherance of continued\ndiscussions regarding a potential strategic partnership, Mr. Norrett and Mr. Greenberg outlined a plan for GSK to conduct a due diligence review of Sierra\nOncology and momelotinib.\nOn March 1, 2022, Sierra Oncology granted representatives of GSK access to an electronic data room containing due diligence information\nregarding Sierra Oncology and momelotinib relevant to potential strategic partnership discussions.\nOn March 7, 2022, following an introduction by Ms. Mojas, Dr. Dilly met with Luke Miels, Chief Commercial Officer at GSK. During the discussion,\nMr. Miels expressed interest in an acquisition of Sierra Oncology by GSK.\nOn March 8, 2022, Mr. Miels delivered to Dr. Dilly a non-binding proposal for GSK to acquire Sierra Oncology for $46.00 in cash per share of Sierra\nOncology common stock, which we refer to as the \u201cinitial GSK proposal.\u201d Dr. Dilly informed Mr. Miels of his personal view that he did not think the\nproposed acquisition price would be interesting to the Sierra Oncology Board, and Mr. Miels responded that he expected GSK would submit an increased\nproposal.\nOn March 10, 2022, the Strategic Transactions Committee met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. Dr. Dilly updated the Strategic Transactions Committee on discussions with GSK and the receipt of the initial GSK proposal.\nRepresentatives of Lazard reviewed preliminary market and valuation perspectives with respect to Sierra Oncology. The Strategic Transactions Committee\ndiscussed next steps if Sierra Oncology were to receive an increased acquisition proposal from GSK, and the potential valuation at which an acquisition\nproposal would merit further exploration, including by commencing a process to solicit interest regarding a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology from\nadditional counterparties. Representatives of Lazard discussed various alternatives and considerations with respect to a potential outreach process,\nincluding additional potential acquirors that Sierra Oncology might consider engaging with based on those parties\u2019 previous interest in a potential\nstrategic partnership with Sierra Oncology, track record of transactions, ability to finance and consummate an acquisition, and likely interest and strategic\nrationale for a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology, including the potential for synergies. Also discussed were the potential risks of an outreach\nprocess, including potential public disclosure leaks, management and employee distraction, and adverse impacts on Sierra Oncology business, and the\nincrease in the likelihood of those risks in a wider private or public process relative to a more targeted outreach. The Strategic Transactions Committee\ndirected management and Lazard to continue discussions and provide additional diligence information to GSK in connection with a potential acquisition,\nwhile also commencing a targeted outreach process to solicit interest from 10 additional potential acquirors designated by the Strategic Transactions\nCommittee as expected to have the most likely interest and ability to consummate an acquisition, if GSK submitted a revised acquisition proposal for\n$50.00 or more per share of Sierra Oncology common stock. The Strategic Transactions Committee also directed Sierra Oncology management to continue\nto engage with other counterparties regarding potential strategic partnerships with respect to the commercialization of momelotinib.\nOn March 11, 2022, Mr. Miels delivered to Dr. Dilly a revised non-binding acquisition proposal for $51.00 in cash per share of Sierra Oncology\ncommon stock, which we refer to as the \u201crevised GSK proposal.\u201d Messrs. Dilly and Norrett updated the members of the Sierra Oncology Board on the\nreceipt of the revised GSK proposal.\nBetween March 11, 2022 and March 15, 2022, in accordance with the directives of the Strategic Transactions Committee, representatives of Lazard\nand members of Sierra Oncology management commenced\n36\nTable of Contents\ntheir outreach to the 10 potential additional acquirors designated by the Strategic Transactions Committee, several of which were engaged in discussions\nregarding a potential strategic partnership with Sierra Oncology and were already reviewing the MOMENTUM study data in connection with such\ndiscussions. Four of these ten counterparties declined to proceed with discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology and did not enter\ninto a confidentiality agreement. Representatives of Lazard and members of Sierra Oncology management engaged in discussions regarding a potential\nacquisition of Sierra Oncology with the remaining six counterparties, which we refer to as \u201cParty A,\u201d \u201cParty B,\u201d \u201cParty C,\u201d \u201cParty D,\u201d \u201cParty E\u201d and\n\u201cParty F,\u201d as described below. Party A, Party B and Party C had previously entered into confidentiality agreements with Sierra Oncology in connection\nwith discussions regarding potential licensing, partnership and other strategic transactions, each of which did not include a \u201cstandstill\u201d or other\nrestriction on the counterparty\u2019s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire Sierra Oncology.\nAlso on March 11, 2022, Dr. Dilly called a representative of Party B to discuss a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology. Party B had been engaged\nin ongoing discussions and due diligence review with Sierra Oncology with respect to a potential licensing or partnership transaction. The representative\nof Party B indicated to Dr. Dilly that Party B would submit a proposal for an acquisition of Sierra Oncology.\nOn March 14, 2022, Party B delivered to Dr. Dilly and Mr. Norrett a non-binding proposal for Party B to acquire Sierra Oncology for $40.00 in cash\nper share of Sierra Oncology common stock, which we refer to as the \u201cParty B proposal.\u201d\nAlso on March 14, 2022, Mr. Norrett called a representative of Party C to discuss a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology. The representative of\nParty C indicated to Mr. Norrett that Party C\u2019s interest with respect to an acquisition of Sierra Oncology by Party C would be contingent on receiving\nadditional clarity regarding anticipated regulatory approvals for momelotinib.\nOn March 16, 2022, the Strategic Transactions Committee met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. Members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard updated the Strategic Transactions Committee on the terms of the\nrevised GSK proposal, as well as the results of Sierra Oncology\u2019s outreach process to solicit interest from additional potential acquirors to date, including\nthe receipt of the Party B proposal. The Strategic Transactions Committee also directed Sierra Oncology management and Lazard to continue the outreach\nprocess and discussions, including by providing management presentations and due diligence information to potentially interested acquirors, including\nto seek improved proposals from GSK and Party B. The Strategic Transactions Committee discussed considerations and risks with respect to a broader\noutreach process and likely interest from potential additional acquirors, and determined not to reach out to additional counterparties at such time. The\nStrategic Transactions Committee also determined to update the Sierra Oncology Board on the discussions with GSK and the results of Sierra Oncology\u2019s\noutreach process to date and, as part of the Sierra Oncology Board\u2019s consideration of these matters, requested that Lazard present to the Sierra Oncology\nBoard a preliminary valuation analysis of Sierra Oncology.\nAlso on March 16, 2022, representatives of Lazard called representatives of Party B\u2019s financial advisor to indicate to them that the value of Party\nB\u2019s proposal was well below the value of another acquisition proposal received by Sierra Oncology and that Party B would need to provide substantially\nhigher value in its proposal, but that Sierra Oncology would provide additional due diligence information to Party B in order to support an increased\nproposal.\nOn March 18, 2022, Sierra Oncology management met with representatives of Party A to provide a management presentation on Sierra Oncology\u2019s\nbusiness and product candidates.\nBetween March 18, 2022 and March 20, 2022, members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard held multiple calls and\nconferences with representatives of GSK and its financial\n37\nTable of Contents\nadvisor, PJT Partners LP (\u201cPJT\u201d), to discuss the scope of GSK\u2019s due diligence review of Sierra Oncology at that time.\nOn March 21, 2022, Sierra Oncology granted representatives of GSK, Party A and Party B and certain of their respective advisors access to an\nelectronic data room containing due diligence information regarding Sierra Oncology and its product candidates relevant to potential acquisition\ndiscussions. Over the next 10 days, members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard held discussion and meetings with\nrepresentatives of GSK and other potentially interested acquirors regarding Sierra Oncology\u2019s product candidates and pipeline, regulatory approvals and\nother relevant due diligence information.\nOn March 22, 2022, a representative of Party B called Dr. Dilly. Dr. Dilly re-iterated to the representative that the Party B proposal was not in a range\nthat the Sierra Oncology Board believed would merit further exploration. The representative of Party B declined to submit an improved proposal and\nindicated that Party B would discontinue due diligence and discussions with respect to an acquisition of Sierra Oncology at that time, but would be\ninterested in re-engaging if Sierra Oncology\u2019s process did not result in a more attractive proposal.\nAlso on March 22, 2022, Sierra Oncology entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party D, which included a \u201cstandstill\u201d provision restricting\nParty D from making public proposals with respect to the acquisition of Sierra Oncology without Sierra Oncology\u2019s prior consent (but not restricting\nconfidential proposals to the Sierra Oncology Board or Sierra Oncology\u2019s chief executive officer), which restrictions terminated in accordance with their\nterms upon Sierra Oncology\u2019s execution of the merger agreement.\nOn March 23, 2022, Sierra Oncology management met with representatives of Party D to provide a management presentation on Sierra Oncology\u2019s\nbusiness and product candidates.\nAlso on March 23, 2022, Sierra Oncology entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party E, which included a \u201cstandstill\u201d provision restricting\nParty E from making public proposals with respect to the acquisition of Sierra Oncology without Sierra Oncology\u2019s prior consent (but not restricting\nconfidential proposals to the Sierra Oncology Board), which restrictions terminated in accordance with their terms upon Sierra Oncology\u2019s execution of\nthe merger agreement.\nAlso on March 23, 2022, Sierra Oncology granted representatives of Party E access to an electronic data room containing due diligence information\nregarding Sierra Oncology and its product candidates relevant to potential acquisition discussions.\nOn March 24, 2022, representatives of Party D called representatives of Lazard to indicate that they did not expect to participate in further\ndiscussions regarding an acquisition of Sierra Oncology, noting that they did not believe Party D could make an acquisition proposal at a valuation that\nSierra Oncology would find attractive.\nAlso on March 24, 2022, the Sierra Oncology Board met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. Members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the discussions with GSK\nand the terms of the revised GSK proposal, as well as the results of Sierra Oncology\u2019s outreach process to solicit interest from additional potential\nand the terms of the revised GSK proposal, as well as the results of Sierra Oncology\u2019s outreach process to solicit interest from additional potential\nacquirors to date.

Following discussion,\nthe Sierra Oncology Board directed members of Sierra Oncology management and Lazard to seek an increased proposal from GSK and also continue to\nprovide management presentations and due diligence information to potentially interested acquirors that had already been contacted at that time. The\nSierra Oncology Board discussed considerations and risks with respect to a broader outreach process and likely interest from potential additional\nacquirors, and determined not to reach out to additional counterparties at that time. It was the consensus of the Sierra Oncology Board that outreach to\nadditional\n38\nTable of Contents\npotential acquirors at such time was not likely to lead to an attractive acquisition proposal and would increase the risk of public disclosure leaks,\nmanagement and employee distraction and adverse impacts on Sierra Oncology\u2019s business. The Strategic Transactions Committee also directed Sierra\nOncology management to continue to engage with other counterparties regarding potential strategic partnerships with respect to the commercialization of\nmomelotinib.\nOn March 26, 2022, Dr. Dilly and Mr. Miels met to continue discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology and GSK\u2019s continued\ndiligence.

Mr. Miels and Dr. Dilly also discussed Sierra Oncology\u2019s willingness to enter into an exclusivity arrangement with GSK.\nDr. Dilly indicated that Sierra Oncology\u2019s willingness to enter into exclusive negotiations with GSK would depend in part on the revised proposal from\nGSK. Mr. Miels indicated that GSK would be submitting a revised proposal the next day.\nAlso on April 1, 2022, representatives of Party E notified representatives of Lazard that Party E was not interested in proceeding with further\ndiscussions regarding an acquisition of Sierra Oncology\nAlso on April 1, 2022, Dr. Dilly met with a representative of a biopharmaceutical company, that we refer to as \u201cParty G,\u201d in connection with ongoing\ndiscussions between Sierra Oncology and Party G regarding opportunities for licensing, partnership and other strategic transactions. As part of the\ndiscussion, Dr. Dilly and the representative discussed on a preliminary basis the possibility of a business combination between Sierra Oncology and\nParty G, but deferred further discussion to a future date.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOn April 2, 2022, Mr. Miels delivered to Dr. Dilly a revised non-binding acquisition proposal for $55.00 in cash per share of Sierra Oncology\ncommon stock, which we refer to as the \u201clast GSK proposal.\u201d As part of the last GSK proposal, GSK requested that Sierra Oncology enter into an\nagreement to negotiate exclusively with GSK for two weeks.

Members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the discussions with GSK\nand the terms of the last GSK proposal, including Sierra Oncology management\u2019s view that GSK\u2019s remaining due diligence review would be confirmatory\nin nature and that the last GSK proposal represented the highest value proposal GSK could offer at this time based on, among other things, the value of\nthe synergies that GSK and Sierra Oncology management believed could be obtained in an acquisition. Members of Sierra Oncology management and\nrepresentatives of Lazard also updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the results of Sierra Oncology\u2019s outreach process to solicit interest from additional\npotential acquirors to date, including that a management presentation was scheduled with representatives of Party F and that discussions with potential\ncounterparties to a strategic partnership transaction with respect to the commercialization of momelotinib were ongoing. It was the consensus of the\nSierra Oncology Board that re-engagement with the other potential acquirors contacted during the process or outreach to additional potential acquirors at\nsuch time was not likely to lead to a superior acquisition proposal than the last GSK proposal, and might jeopardize the successful execution of a\ntransaction with GSK based on the last GSK proposal. Following this discussion, the Sierra Oncology Board authorized Sierra Oncology to enter into\nexclusive negotiations with GSK for a period of seven days and directed Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini to negotiate\nthe terms of an acquisition of Sierra Oncology with GSK on the basis of the last GSK proposal. Following this meeting, consistent with the directions of\nthe Sierra Oncology Board, representatives of Lazard called representatives of PJT to indicate that Sierra Oncology would be prepared to provide\nconfirmatory due diligence information and enter into exclusive negotiations with GSK for a period of seven days on the basis of the last GSK proposal.\nOn April 4, 2022, representatives of PJT called representatives of Lazard to accept Sierra Oncology\u2019s proposal for a shortened exclusivity period.\nOn April 4, 2022, following negotiation of the terms, Sierra Oncology and GSK entered into an exclusivity agreement in which Sierra Oncology\nagreed to negotiate exclusively with GSK until 11:59 p.m. (pacific time) on April 11, 2022. The exclusivity period was not subsequently extended or\nrenewed.\nAlso on April 4, 2022, Sierra Oncology contacted representatives of Party F to cancel their scheduled management presentation meeting. Sierra\nOncology also cancelled the scheduled conferences with potential counterparties to a strategic partnership transaction with respect to the\ncommercialization of momelotinib.\nAlso on April 4, 2022, Wilson Sonsini delivered an initial draft of the definitive agreement to Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, GSK\u2019s outside\ncounsel (which we refer to as \u201cCleary Gottlieb\u201d) in connection with the merger. Between April 4, 2022 and April 12, 2022, representatives of Sierra\nOncology and GSK and their respective legal advisors negotiated the terms of the merger agreement. Key terms of the merger agreement negotiated\nbetween the parties included (1) the structure of the acquisition, (2) the terms of the \u201cno-shop\u201d restrictions and the circumstances in which the Sierra\nOncology Board could change its recommendation to its stockholders or negotiate or accept an alternative acquisition transaction, including the\ncircumstances in which the merger agreement could be terminated\u037e (3) the amount of the termination fee and the circumstances in which it would be\npayable\u037e (4) the definition of \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect\u201d with respect to Sierra Oncology\u037e (5) the conditions to each party\u2019s obligation to complete the\nmerger\u037e (6) the parties\u2019 commitments in connection with obtaining required regulatory approvals\u037e (7) the interim operating covenants applicable to Sierra\nOncology prior to the closing of the merger and related exceptions for matters such as employee hiring and compensation and entry into material\ncontracts or transactions by Sierra Oncology\u037e and (8) Sierra Oncology\u2019s other representations,\n40\nTable of Contents\nwarranties and covenants in the merger agreement. Representatives of GSK also discussed with representatives of Sierra Oncology the possibility of\nentering into retention agreements with certain members of Sierra Oncology management following the completion of the merger to facilitate GSK\u2019s\nintegration and transition efforts with respect to Sierra Oncology\u2019s business and product candidates, and potential related compensation arrangements.\nThe Sierra Oncology Board was kept apprised of these discussions. GSK declined to enter into any retention or compensation agreements with members\nof Sierra Oncology management prior to the execution of the merger agreement.\nAlso beginning on April 4, 2022, representatives of GSK and its advisors, including Cleary Gottlieb, were provided access to additional legal and\noperational due diligence documents and information regarding Sierra Oncology in its electronic data room to support their continued due diligence\nreview of Sierra Oncology. Between April 4, 2022 and April 12, 2022, members of GSK management and its advisors conducted confirmatory operational,\nregulatory, legal, financial, employment and other due diligence on Sierra Oncology, including reviews of Sierra Oncology\u2019s product candidates and\nanticipated regulatory approvals, efforts in support of potential commercialization, intellectual property, commercial relationships and employment\narrangements and employee benefit plans, and from time to time had discussions with members of Sierra Oncology management and its advisors\nregarding due diligence information and related matters.\nOn April 8, 2022, Cleary Gottlieb delivered an initial draft of the support agreement to Wilson Sonsini. GSK requested that each director and\nexecutive officer of Sierra Oncology, and each of their affiliates holding shares of our common stock (including certain funds affiliated with OrbiMed\nAdvisors, LLC, Abingworth Management Limited, and Vivo Capital LLC that are affiliated with certain of Sierra Oncology\u2019s directors) enter into\nagreements to support the merger. Between April 8, 2022 and April 12, 2022, representatives of Sierra Oncology, GSK and certain of the support agreement\nparties and their respective legal advisors negotiated the terms of the support agreement. Key terms of the support agreement negotiated between the\nparties included (1) the support required from the support agreement parties based on the structure of the acquisition\u037e (2) the restrictions on transfer of\nSierra Oncology\u2019s securities by the support agreement parties prior to the completion of the merger and exceptions thereto\u037e and (3) the support agreement\nparties\u2019 other representations, warranties and covenants in the support agreements.\nOn April 10, 2022, the Sierra Oncology Board met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. Members of management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the negotiation of the merger\nagreement and support agreements. Representatives of Lazard reviewed Lazard\u2019s financial analyses with respect to the merger, and confirmed their\nexpectation that Lazard Fr\u00e8res would be in a position to deliver its opinion regarding the fairness of the merger consideration. The Sierra Oncology Board\nalso reviewed with members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard the results of Sierra Oncology\u2019s outreach process to solicit\ninterest from alternative potential acquirors\u037e it was the consensus of the Sierra Oncology Board that re-engagement with the other potential acquirors\ncontacted during the process or outreach to additional potential acquirors was not likely to lead to a superior acquisition proposal than the merger, could\njeopardize the successful entry into an acquisition transaction with GSK at the per share price and could cause significant disruption to Sierra Oncology.\nRepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the Sierra Oncology Board their fiduciary duties. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the key\nterms of the merger agreement and support agreements. The Sierra Oncology Board noted the customary relationship disclosures provided by Lazard\nregarding its relationship with GSK (which disclosures had been updated as of January 7, 2022)\u037e the Sierra Oncology Board of directors did not identify\nany concerns with these disclosures. The Sierra Oncology Board directed Sierra Oncology management and Wilson Sonsini to continue the negotiation\nof the merger agreement.\nOn April 11, 2022, the Sierra Oncology Board met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. Members of management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the negotiation of the merger\nagreement and support agreements. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed modifications to the terms of the merger agreement and support\n41\nTable of Contents\nagreements since the meeting of the Sierra Oncology Board held the prior day. Representatives of Lazard Fr\u00e8res reviewed Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 financial\nanalyses with respect to the merger. The representatives of Lazard Fr\u00e8res rendered the oral opinion of Lazard Fr\u00e8res, subsequently confirmed by delivery\nof a written opinion dated April 12, 2022, to the Sierra Oncology Board that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the various\nmatters, limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the per share price (subject to applicable withholding of taxes) to be received by the\nholders of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares (as such terms are defined in\nthe merger agreement), if applicable) pursuant to the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Sierra Oncology Board directed\nSierra Oncology management and Wilson Sonsini to finalize the merger agreement and related transaction documents.\nOn April 12, 2022, after market close, the Sierra Oncology Board met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. Members of management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the negotiation of the\nmerger agreement and support agreements. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the final merger agreement and support agreement.\nRepresentatives of Lazard Fr\u00e8res confirmed that the oral opinion of Lazard Fr\u00e8res, previously provided on April 11, 2022 and subsequently confirmed by\ndelivery of a written opinion dated April 12, 2022, to the Sierra Oncology Board that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the\nvarious matters, limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the per share price (subject to applicable withholding of taxes) to be\nreceived by the holders of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares (as such terms\nare defined in the merger agreement), if applicable) pursuant to the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, was unchanged. The\nmeeting of the Sierra Oncology Board was then adjourned, and the Strategic Transactions Committee met with the other members of the Sierra Oncology\nBoard, Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Transactions Committee approved\nthe merger agreement and the merger and recommended that the Sierra Oncology Board approve the merger agreement and the merger. The Sierra\nOncology Board meeting then reconvened and the Sierra Oncology Board, upon consideration of the factors more fully described in the section of this\nproxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Recommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,\u201d unanimously (1) determined\nthat it is in the best interests of Sierra Oncology and Sierra Oncology stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement and\nconsummate the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement\u037e (2) approved the execution and delivery of the\nmerger agreement and the support agreement by Sierra Oncology, the performance by Sierra Oncology of its covenants and other obligations in the\nmerger agreement and the support agreements, and the consummation of the merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement and the support agreements, respectively, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein\u037e (3) directed the adoption of the merger agreement\nbe submitted to a vote at a meeting of Sierra Oncology stockholders\u037e and (4) recommended that Sierra Oncology stockholders vote in favor of the\nadoption of the merger agreement.\nLater on April 12, 2022, following the meeting of the Sierra Oncology Board, Sierra Oncology and GSK executed the merger agreement. The support\nagreements were also executed.\nOn April 13, 2022, Sierra Oncology and GSK publicly announced the merger and the execution of the merger agreement and the support\nagreements.\nRecommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board\nThe Sierra Oncology Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Sierra Oncology and its stockholders\u037e and (2) adopted and approved the merger\nagreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe Sierra Oncology Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation\nthat will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the\nspecial meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger\nagreement at the time of the special meeting.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Sierra Oncology Board consulted with Sierra Oncology management, as well as\nrepresentatives of each of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini. In recommending that Sierra Oncology stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger\nagreement, the Sierra Oncology Board considered and analyzed a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented\nin order of relative importance). Based on these consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the Sierra Oncology Board\nconcluded that entering into the merger agreement with GSK was advisable and in the best interests of Sierra Oncology and our stockholders.\nThe Sierra Oncology Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination and recommendation:\n\u2022\nBusiness, Financial Condition, Prospects and Execution Risks. The Sierra Oncology Board considered the current and historical financial\ncondition and results of operations, competitive positioning, assets, business and prospects of Sierra Oncology, including certain\nunaudited forward-looking financial information with respect to Sierra Oncology\u2019s future financial performance prepared by members of\nSierra Oncology management and the execution risks and uncertainties associated with the development, regulatory approvals and\ncommercialization of Sierra Oncology\u2019s product candidates. The Sierra Oncology Board considered the potential opportunity to create value\nthrough continued execution of its business plan, and certain risks and uncertainties associated with Sierra Oncology and its business,\nincluding the risks and uncertainties inherent in the development of novel therapeutic treatments\u037e risks and uncertainties regarding the\nreceipt, timing and scope of regulatory approvals for momelotinib and Sierra Oncology\u2019s other product candidates\u037e risks related to\neffectively commercializing momelotinib and Sierra Oncology\u2019s other product candidates\u037e risks relating to Sierra Oncology\u2019s ability to enter\ninto and successfully execute on value-creating licensing, partnership and other strategic relationships with third parties with respect to\nproduct candidates\u037e risks related to the manufacture and supply of Sierra Oncology\u2019s products\u037e competition from other hematology and\noncology companies, some of which have substantially more financing resources than Sierra Oncology\u037e factors affecting the revenues,\noperating costs and profitability of biopharmaceutical companies generally and other risk factors described in Sierra Oncology\u2019s other\nfilings with the SEC, as listed under the section titled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d In connection with these matters and the\nevaluation of strategic alternatives, the Sierra Oncology Board considered the fact that Sierra Oncology had recently completed a public\noffering of common stock and pre-funded warrants that raised $145.3 million. The Sierra Oncology Board also noted the fact that Sierra\nOncology has incurred net losses in every year since inception and anticipate that Sierra Oncology will continue to incur net losses for\nsome time, and considered the risks and uncertainties related to the potential need for additional debt, equity financing or other financing in\nthe future, as well as the potential impact of restrictions on Sierra Oncology\u2019s operations, potential dilution of Sierra Oncology\u2019s\nstockholders, or the loss of rights resulting from financing transactions.\n\u2022\nResults of Strategic Review Process. The merger agreement was the result of an extensive strategic review process overseen by the\nStrategic Transactions Committee and the Sierra Oncology Board. The Sierra Oncology Board considered Sierra Oncology\u2019s outreach\nprocess, with the assistance of Lazard, to identify whether other potential parties might be interested in pursuing an acquisition of Sierra\nOncology on attractive terms, and to contact those parties believed to be most likely to have interest in pursuing such an acquisition\u037e and\nconsidered the responses received from such contacted parties,\n43\nTable of Contents\nincluding the fact that only Party B (in addition to GSK) submitted a proposal to acquire Sierra Oncology at a value of $40.00 per share of\nSierra Oncology common stock. The Sierra Oncology Board, after consulting with Sierra Oncology management and Lazard, determined that\nfurther engagement with the other potential acquirors contacted during Sierra Oncology\u2019s outreach process or engagement with additional\npotential acquirors was not likely to lead to a superior acquisition proposal than the merger, could jeopardize the successful entry into an\nacquisition transaction with GSK at the per share price and could cause significant disruption to Sierra Oncology. The Sierra Oncology\nBoard also noted that Sierra Oncology had historically engaged in discussions with various participants in the biopharmaceutical industry\nregarding opportunities for strategic partnerships and collaborations with respect to the development and commercialization of product\ncandidates, and that Sierra Oncology\u2019s business and product candidates were well-known to various counterparties that could have made a\nproposal to acquire Sierra Oncology if such a transaction had been interesting or attractive to such counterparties.\n\u2022\nCash Consideration and Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the merger consists entirely of cash,\nwhich provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business and financial execution risks of Sierra Oncology\u2019s long-term\noperating plan. The receipt of cash consideration eliminates uncertainty and risk for our stockholders related to the continued execution of\nSierra Oncology\u2019s business. In that regard, the Sierra Oncology Board noted that Sierra Oncology\u2019s stock price could be negatively\nimpacted if we failed to meet investor expectations with respect to the development, regulatory approvals and commercialization of Sierra\nOncology\u2019s product candidates or results of operations.\n\u2022\nBest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Sierra Oncology Board that the per share merger consideration represents the best\nvalue reasonably obtainable for the shares of our common stock, taking into account the business, operations, prospects, business\nstrategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of Sierra Oncology on a historical and prospective basis. In addition, the Sierra\nOncology Board believed that, measured against the longer-term execution risks (described above), the per share merger consideration\nreflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of our common stock. The Sierra Oncology Board also noted Sierra Oncology management\u2019s\nbelief that the per share merger consideration represented the highest value proposal GSK could offer at this time based on, among other\nthings, the value of the synergies that GSK and Sierra Oncology management believed could be obtained in an acquisition. The Sierra\nOncology Board also considered that the per share merger consideration constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 39 percent to the\nclosing price of our common stock on April 12, 2022, which was the last full trading day before announcement of the transaction\u037e and (2) a\npremium of approximately 63 percent to the volume-weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of our common stock over the 30 trading days ending\nApril 12, 2022.\n\u2022\nPotential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Sierra Oncology Board that none of the possible alternatives to the merger\n(including the possibility of continuing to operate Sierra Oncology as an independent company, including the need for Sierra Oncology to\npursue strategic partnerships and collaborations and capital raising transactions, and the desirability and perceived risks of those\nalternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to Sierra Oncology\u2019s stockholders of those alternatives and the timing and likelihood\nof effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for us to create greater value for our stockholders,\ntaking into account execution risks as well as business, competitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory risks.\n\u2022\nFairness Opinion of Lazard Fr\u00e8res. The oral opinion of Lazard Fr\u00e8res rendered to the Sierra Oncology Board, subsequently confirmed in\nwriting, that, as of April 12, 2022, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Lazard Fr\u00e8res as set forth in its written opinion, the merger\nconsideration to be paid to holders of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock, subject to applicable withholding taxes, (other than the\nexcluded holders) in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The opinion is more fully described in the section of\nthis proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Opinion of\n44\nTable of Contents\nLazard Fr\u00e8res & Co. LLC\u201d and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.\n\u2022\nSpeed and Likelihood of Consummation. The Sierra Oncology Board considered the likelihood that the merger would be consummated, and\nthe expected timing of the consummation of the merger, based on, among other things, (1) the limited conditions to each party\u2019s obligation\nto consummate the merger, including the fact that there is no financing condition to GSK\u2019s obligation to consummate the merger\u037e (2) that\nthere are not expected to be significant antitrust or other regulatory impediments, other than review pursuant to the HSR Act, to completing\nthe merger, as further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Regulatory Approvals\u201d\u037e (3) each party\u2019s obligations in\nconnection with obtaining required regulatory and other approvals and satisfying the conditions to the consummation of the merger\u037e (4) the\nfact that Sierra Oncology stockholders (including certain funds affiliated with OrbiMed Advisors, LLC, Abingworth Management Limited,\nand Vivo Capital LLC that are affiliated with certain of Sierra Oncology\u2019s directors) holding approximately 28% of the outstanding Sierra\nOncology shares entered into support agreements committing to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e and (5) the\nbusiness reputation, capabilities and financial condition of GSK, and the Sierra Oncology Board\u2019s perception that GSK is willing to devote\nthe resources necessary to complete the merger in an expeditious manner.\n\u2022\nNegotiations with GSK and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the merger agreement, which was the product of arms\u2019-length\nnegotiations with the assistance of Sierra Oncology\u2019s advisors. Certain provisions of the merger agreement that the Sierra Oncology Board\nconsidered important included, among others:\n\u2022\nSierra Oncology\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties\nregarding acquisition proposals.\n\u2022\nThe Sierra Oncology Board\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its recommendation that our stockholders\nvote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.\n\u2022\nThe Sierra Oncology Board\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative\nacquisition agreement. In that regard, the Sierra Oncology Board believed that the termination fee payable by Sierra Oncology in such\ninstance was reasonable, consistent with or below similar fees payable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.\n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to our stockholders who timely and properly exercise such\nappraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.\nThe Sierra Oncology Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the merger, including the following (which are not listed\nin any relative order of importance):\n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the merger as a cash transaction means that our stockholders\nwill not participate in Sierra Oncology\u2019s future earnings or growth and will not benefit from any appreciation in value of the surviving\ncorporation.\n\u2022\nNo-Shop Restrictions. The restrictions in the merger agreement on Sierra Oncology\u2019s ability to solicit competing proposals (subject to\ncertain exceptions to allow the Sierra Oncology Board to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a superior proposal, and then only upon\nthe payment of a termination fee).\n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the merger might not be consummated, and if it is not\nconsummated, that: (1) Sierra Oncology\u2019s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort\nand will have experienced significant distractions from their work on behalf of Sierra Oncology during the pendency of the merger\u037e (2) Sierra\nOncology will have incurred significant transaction and other costs\u037e (3) Sierra\n45\nTable of Contents\nOncology\u2019s continuing business relationships with business partners and employees may be adversely affected\u037e (4) the trading price of our\ncommon stock could be adversely affected\u037e (5) the other contractual and legal remedies available to Sierra Oncology in the event of the\ntermination of the merger agreement may be insufficient, costly to pursue or both\u037e and (6) the failure of the merger to be consummated could\nresult in an adverse perception among Sierra Oncology\u2019s existing and potential business partners, employees and investors about Sierra\nOncology\u2019s prospects.\n\u2022\nImpact of Interim Restrictions on Sierra Oncology\u2019s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger. The restrictions on the conduct of\nSierra Oncology\u2019s business prior to the consummation of the merger, which may delay or prevent it from undertaking strategic initiatives\nbefore the completion of the merger that, absent the merger agreement, Sierra Oncology might have pursued.\n\u2022\nEffects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the merger, including the: (1) effects on Sierra Oncology\u2019s\nemployees, operating results and stock price\u037e (2) impact on Sierra Oncology\u2019s ability to attract and retain key management, sales and\nmarketing and technical personnel\u037e and (3) potential for litigation in connection with the merger.\n\u2022\nTermination Fee Payable by Sierra Oncology. The requirement that Sierra Oncology pay GSK the termination fee of $70,000,000 under\ncertain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement, including if the Sierra Oncology Board terminates the merger\nagreement to accept a superior proposal. The Sierra Oncology Board considered the potentially discouraging impact that this termination\nfee could have on a third party\u2019s interest in making a competing proposal to acquire Sierra Oncology.\n\u2022\nTaxable Consideration. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our common stock in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes.\n\u2022\nInterests of Sierra Oncology\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers. The interests that our directors and executive officers may have in the\nmerger, which may be different from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders.\nThis discussion is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it summarizes the material reasons and factors evaluated by the Sierra Oncology Board in its\nconsideration of the merger. After considering these and other factors, the Sierra Oncology Board concluded that the potential benefits of entering into\nthe merger agreement outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In light of the variety of factors considered by the Sierra Oncology Board and the\ncomplexity of these factors, the Sierra Oncology Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the\nforegoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Sierra Oncology Board applied his or her own\npersonal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different relative weights to the different factors. The Sierra Oncology Board adopted\nand approved the merger agreement and the merger, and recommended that Sierra Oncology stockholders adopt the merger agreement, based upon the\ntotality of the information presented to, and considered by, the Sierra Oncology Board.",

The current volatility and disruption in the credit and financial markets relating to, among others, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, may have an effect on Sierra Oncology, and Lazard Fr\u00e8res did not express an opinion as to the\neffects of such volatility or such disruption on Sierra Oncology. Lazard Fr\u00e8res did not express any opinion as to the price at which shares may trade at\nany time subsequent to the announcement of the merger. Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any\nother transaction or business strategy in which Sierra Oncology might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by Sierra Oncology to engage in\nthe merger.\nIn connection with its opinion, Lazard Fr\u00e8res:\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions of the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to Sierra Oncology\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to it by Sierra Oncology relating to the business of Sierra Oncology\u037e\n\u2022\nheld discussions with members of Sierra Oncology\u2019s senior management with respect to the businesses and prospects of Sierra Oncology\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business Lazard Fr\u00e8res believed to be generally relevant in\nevaluating the businesses of Sierra Oncology\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of business Lazard Fr\u00e8res believed to be\ngenerally relevant in evaluating the business of Sierra Oncology\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock\u037e and\n\u2022\nconducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Lazard Fr\u00e8res deemed appropriate.\nLazard Fr\u00e8res assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent verification of such\ninformation.

The summary of Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 analyses and reviews provided below is not a\ncomplete description of the analyses and reviews underlying Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving\nvarious determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of analysis and review and the application of those methods to particular\ncircumstances, and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to summary description.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Lazard Fr\u00e8res did not draw in isolation conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,\nLazard Fr\u00e8res made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its\nanalyses. Considering selected portions of its analyses and reviews in the summary set forth below, without considering its analyses and reviews as a\nwhole, could create an incomplete or misleading view of the analyses and reviews underlying Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 opinion.\nFor purposes of its analyses and reviews, Lazard Fr\u00e8res considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Sierra Oncology. No company, business or transaction considered in Lazard\nFr\u00e8res\u2019 analyses and reviews is identical to Sierra Oncology or the merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely\nmathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and\nother factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions considered in Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019\nanalyses and reviews. The estimates contained in Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis\nor review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nthose suggested by Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities\ndo not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used\nin, and the results derived from, Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe summary of the analyses and reviews provided below includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Lazard\nFr\u00e8res\u2019 analyses and reviews, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete\ndescription of Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full description of its analyses and\nreviews, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying its analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Lazard\nFr\u00e8res\u2019 analyses and reviews.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed\non or before the date of Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 opinion, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nFinancial Analyses\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nUsing the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information provided to, and approved by Sierra Oncology for use by, Lazard Fr\u00e8res for the purposes of\nits financial analyses and fairness opinion, Lazard Fr\u00e8res performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Sierra Oncology.\nA discounted cash flow analysis is a valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of a company by calculating the present value of the\ncompany\u2019s estimated future cash flows. A company\u2019s \u201cestimated future cash flows\u201d are its projected unlevered free cash flows, and \u201cpresent value\u201d\nrefers to the value today or as of an assumed date of the future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting the estimated future cash flows or\namounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, capital structure,\nincome taxes, expected returns and other appropriate factors.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Lazard Fr\u00e8res calculated a range of enterprise values for Sierra Oncology by discounting to present value, utilizing\ndiscount rates ranging from 10.0% to 12.0%, chosen by Lazard Fr\u00e8res based upon its analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Sierra Oncology\nand using the mid-year convention, (i) the estimated probability-adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows to be generated by Sierra Oncology from\nMarch 31, 2022 through the end of terminal year of 2040\u037e and (ii) a range of terminal values for Sierra Oncology.\nThe terminal values were derived by applying a negative terminal growth rate range of (50%) \u2013 (30%) to the estimated unlevered free cash flow for\nthe terminal year to be generated by Sierra Oncology. The negative terminal growth rates used by Lazard Fr\u00e8res were estimated by Lazard Fr\u00e8res based on\nits professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\nLazard Fr\u00e8res then added to the range of enterprise values the estimated net cash of Sierra Oncology at March 31, 2022 of approximately $271\nmillion to derive a range of total equity values for Sierra Oncology. Lazard Fr\u00e8res then calculated a range of implied equity values per share by dividing\nsuch total equity values of Sierra Oncology by the number of fully diluted shares of Sierra Oncology common stock (approximately 32.7 million), as\ncalculated based on information provided by Sierra Oncology with respect to dilutive securities outstanding as of April 8, 2022. The results of this\nanalysis implied an equity value per share range of $38.05 to $43.45, rounded to the nearest $0.05.\nSelected Public Companies Analysis\nUsing public filings and data sources, Lazard Fr\u00e8res reviewed and analyzed certain financial information, valuation multiples and market trading\ndata related to selected comparable publicly traded biotechnology companies, the operations of which Lazard Fr\u00e8res believed, based on its experience\nwith companies in the biotechnology industry and its professional judgment, to be generally relevant in analyzing Sierra Oncology\u2019s operations for\npurposes of this analysis. Lazard Fr\u00e8res compared such information for the selected comparable companies to the corresponding information for Sierra\nOncology.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe companies in the biotechnology industry selected by Lazard Fr\u00e8res for this analysis were as follows:\n\u2022\nBlueprint Medicines Corporation\n\u2022\nIovance Biotherapeutics, Inc.\n\u2022\nImmunoGen, Inc.\n\u2022\nADC Therapeutics SA\n\u2022\nKaryopharm Therapeutics Inc.\n\u2022\nMacrogenics, Inc.\n\u2022\nCTI Biopharma Corp.\nLazard Fr\u00e8res selected the companies above because, among other things, the selected companies operate businesses similar in certain respects to\nthe business of Sierra Oncology. However, none of the selected companies is identical to Sierra Oncology and certain of these companies may have\ncharacteristics that are materially different from those of Sierra Oncology. Based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard Fr\u00e8res believes that\npurely quantitative analyses are not, in isolation, determinative in the context of the merger and that qualitative judgments concerning differences\nbetween the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of Sierra Oncology and the selected companies that could affect the public\ntrading values of each company are also relevant.\nFor each of the selected companies above, Lazard Fr\u00e8res calculated the enterprise value of the selected company (calculated as the market\ncapitalization, taking into account in-the-money options and other equity awards and convertible securities, plus the book value of debt, and preferred\nequity, less cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and long term investments, plus book value of minority interests) as of April 11, 2022, as a\nmultiple of the probability-adjusted revenue estimates for 2026 from FactSet Research Systems, Wall Street research and public filings, referred to in this\nsection as \u201cEV/Probability-Adjusted FY+5 Revenue.\u201d The results of this analysis are as follows:\nEnterprise\nValue /\nProbability-\nAdjusted\nFY+5\nRevenue\n75th Percentile\n2.1x\nMedian\n1.5x\nMean\n1.7x\n25th Percentile\n1.2x\nUsing its professional judgment and experience, Lazard Fr\u00e8res then applied a range of multiples of estimated EV/Probability-Adjusted FY+5\nRevenues, based on the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the estimated EV/Probability-Adjusted FY+5 Revenue for the selected companies of 1.2x\nand 2.1x, respectively, to Sierra Oncology\u2019s estimated probability-adjusted revenues for 2026, from the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information. The\nresults of this analysis implied an equity value per share range of $27.05 to $37.65, rounded to the nearest $0.05.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis\nUsing public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard Fr\u00e8res reviewed and analyzed selected precedent transactions involving\nbiotechnology companies that Lazard Fr\u00e8res viewed as generally relevant in evaluating the merger. In performing these analyses, Lazard Fr\u00e8res analyzed\ncertain financial information and transaction multiples relating to companies in the selected transactions and compared such information to the\ncorresponding information for the merger.\n50\nTable of Contents\nSpecifically, Lazard Fr\u00e8res reviewed five merger and acquisition transactions in the biotechnology industry announced since January 1, 2018, that\nLazard Fr\u00e8res deemed relevant to consider in relation to Sierra Oncology and the merger. These transactions are listed below. Although none of the\nselected precedent transactions or the target companies in such transactions is directly comparable to the merger or to Sierra Oncology, all of the\ntransactions were chosen because they involve transactions that, for the purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to the merger and/or\ninvolve targets that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to Sierra Oncology.\nAnnouncement Date\nAcquiror\nTarget\n06/02/21\nMorphoSys AG\nConstellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n03/04/21\nAmgen Inc.\nFive Prime Therapeutics, Inc.\n05/04/20\nA. Menarini\u2014Industrie Farmaceutiche Riunite\u2014S.R.L.\nStemline Therapeutics, Inc.\n05/10/18\nEli Lilly and Company\nARMO BioSciences, Inc.\n01/31/18\nSeattle Genetics, Inc.\nCascadian Therapeutics, Inc.\nUsing data regarding the precedent transactions and the target companies available from public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard\nFr\u00e8res examined the selected transactions with respect to the upfront consideration, as a multiple of the target company\u2019s five-year forward probability-\nadjusted revenues (which are referred to in this section as \u201cTV/Probability-Adjusted FY+5 Revenue\u201d), as reflected in publicly available consensus\nestimates at the time of the transaction announcement. The results of this analysis are as follows:\nTV /\nProbability-\nAdjusted\nFY+5\nRevenue\n75th Percentile\n2.7x\nMedian\n1.6x\nMean\n2.0x\n25th Percentile\n1.2x\nUsing its professional judgment and experience, Lazard Fr\u00e8res then applied a range of TV/Probability-Adjusted FY+5 Revenue multiples for the\nselected precedent transactions based on the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of TV/FY+5 Revenue multiples, which ranged from 1.2x to 2.7x, to Sierra\nOncology\u2019s estimated revenues for 2026, from the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The results of this analysis implied an equity value per\nshare range of $27.05 to $44.75, rounded to the nearest $0.05.\nOther Analyses\nThe analyses and data described below were presented to the Sierra Oncology Board for informational purposes only and did not provide the basis\nfor, and were not otherwise material to, the rendering of Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 opinion.\nPremia Paid Analysis\nUsing information from public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard Fr\u00e8res analyzed the premia paid for acquisitions of publicly-\ntraded companies in the biotechnology industry by strategic buyers with transaction equity values implied for the target company in the transaction\nbased on the consideration payable at the closing of the selected transaction (excluding contingent value rights) ranging between $1 billion and $4 billion\nthat have been announced since January 1, 2018. For each of the precedent transactions, Lazard Fr\u00e8res calculated the implied premia as a percentage\nbased on the amount by which the per share consideration in each transaction exceeded the target company\u2019s (i) closing share price on the last trading\nday upon which shares of Sierra Oncology traded on an unaffected basis, (ii) 30-day volume weighted average price based on trading days (\u201cVWAP\u201d)\nand (iii) 52-week high share price based on intraday prices.\n51\nTable of Contents\nBased on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard Fr\u00e8res then (i) applied the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the 1-day unaffected per\nshare price premia for the selected companies of approximately 54% and 111%, respectively, to the 1-day unaffected price per share of Sierra Oncology\ncommon stock to calculate an implied equity value per share range of $59.05 to $80.90, rounded to the nearest $0.05, (ii) applied the 25th percentile and\n75th percentile of the 30-day VWAP premia for the selected companies of approximately 59% and 123%, respectively, to the 30-day VWAP of the shares of\nSierra Oncology common stock to calculate an implied equity value per share range of $53.20 to $74.60, rounded to the nearest $0.05, and (iii) applied the\n25th percentile and 75th percentile of the 52-week intraday high premia for the selected companies of approximately (12)% and 37%, respectively, to the\n52-week intraday high price of the shares of Sierra Oncology common stock to calculate an implied equity value per share range of $34.95 to $54.40,\nrounded to the nearest $0.05.\nResearch Analyst Price Targets\nLazard Fr\u00e8res reviewed selected equity research analyst price targets based on published, publicly available Wall Street equity research reports.\nLazard Fr\u00e8res observed that such price targets ranged from $39.00 per share to $51.00 per share, with a median of $45.00 per share.\n52-Week High/Low Trading Prices\nLazard Fr\u00e8res reviewed the range of trading prices of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock for the 52 weeks ended on April 11, 2022. Lazard\nFr\u00e8res observed that, during such period, the intraday share price of the shares of Sierra Oncology common stock ranged from $14.90 per share to $39.70\nper share, in each case rounded to the nearest $0.05.\nMiscellaneous\nThe Company has agreed to pay Lazard an estimated transaction fee of approximately $44 million, payable upon the consummation of the merger, of\nwhich $2.0 million became payable upon delivery of the fairness opinion.\nIn addition, Sierra Oncology has agreed to reimburse Lazard for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its engagement,\nincluding reasonable fees of counsel, and will indemnify Lazard and certain related persons against certain liabilities arising out of Lazard\u2019s engagement.\nLazard has in the two years prior to the delivery of Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 opinion on April 12, 2022 provided certain financial advisory services to GSK and\ncertain of its affiliates, including advising GSK in connection with investor analysis, for which Lazard has received and expects to receive compensation\nin an amount less than $150,000 in the aggregate. Lazard, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted\nsecurities, private placements, leveraged buyouts, and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. In addition, in the ordinary course, Lazard and\nits affiliates and employees may trade securities of Sierra Oncology, GSK and certain of their affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their\ncustomers, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, and may also trade and hold securities on behalf of Sierra Oncology, GSK and\ncertain of their respective affiliates. The issuance of Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 opinion was approved by the opinion committee of Lazard Fr\u00e8res.\nLazard is an internationally recognized investment banking firm providing a full range of financial advisory and other services. Lazard was selected\nto act as financial advisor to Sierra Oncology after considering Lazard\u2019s qualifications, independence, expertise, international reputation, knowledge of\nthe biopharmaceutical industry and experience acting as financial advisor in connection with similar partnership and strategic transactions.\nLazard Fr\u00e8res prepared these analyses solely for purposes of, and the analyses were delivered to the Sierra Oncology Board in connection with, the\nprovision of its opinion to the Sierra Oncology Board as to the fairness,\n52\nTable of Contents\nfrom a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock (other than shares held by the excluded holders) of the merger\nconsideration to be paid in the merger. Lazard Fr\u00e8res did not recommend any specific consideration to the Sierra Oncology Board or that any given\nconsideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 opinion was one of many factors considered by the Sierra\nOncology Board, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Recommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board and the\nReasons for the Merger.\u201d\nCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information",

However, Sierra Oncology\u2019s management regularly prepares and reviews\nwith the Sierra Oncology Board estimates regarding the success and timing of the development of, regulatory filings and approvals for and the\ncommercialization of our product candidates, as well as various partnership scenarios for the development and commercialization of our product\ncandidates outside of the United States. In connection with our strategic planning process and the Sierra Oncology Board\u2019s evaluation of strategic\nalternatives, as described further in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Background of the Merger,\u201d Sierra Oncology\u2019s management\nprepared and reviewed with the Sierra Oncology Board various unaudited forward-looking financial information with respect to our future financial\nperformance for fiscal years 2022 through 2040, including the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information summarized below.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and was provided to the Sierra\nOncology Board for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the merger. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was also\nprovided to, and approved by Sierra Oncology for use by, Lazard, Sierra Oncology\u2019s financial advisor, for the purposes of Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 financial\nanalyses and fairness opinion in connection with the merger (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Opinion of\nLazard Fr\u00e8res & Co. LLC\u201d). The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information includes estimates of Sierra Oncology\u2019s financial performance on a\nprobability-adjusted basis for purposes of Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 discounted free cash flow analysis and other financial analyses. These probability adjustments\nwere reviewed by Sierra Oncology\u2019s management and approved for Lazard Fr\u00e8res\u2019 use by Sierra Oncology. With Sierra Oncology\u2019s consent, Lazard Fr\u00e8res\nassumed that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and\njudgments as to our future financial performance, and relied on Sierra Oncology\u2019s assessments of as to the validity of, and risks associated with, our\nproduct candidates.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed by Sierra Oncology\u2019s management as estimates of our future financial\nperformance as an independent company, without giving effect to the merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the merger\nagreement or the merger, the expenses that have already and will be incurred in connection with completing the merger or any changes to Sierra\nOncology\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented during the pendency of or following the consummation of the merger.

The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nis not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not fact\nand should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our future results.\nAlthough the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates\nas to future events made and approved by Sierra Oncology\u2019s management.

The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects assumptions and\nuncertainties that are subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information not\nto be achieved are described in various risk factors described in the sections of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014 Risk Factors\u201d and \u201c\u2014Cautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and in our other filings with the SEC, as listed under the section titled \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation.\u201d All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of our control.

Additionally, concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of our directors and executive officers, together with certain\nfunds affiliated with OrbiMed Advisors, LLC, Abingworth Management Limited, and Vivo Capital LLC that are affiliated with certain of our directors, in\neach case solely in their capacities as holders of our common stock and other Sierra Oncology securities (which we refer to as the \u201csupport agreement\nparties\u201d), entered into the support agreements with GSK and Sierra Oncology. These support agreements obligate the applicable stockholders to vote\ntheir respective shares of Sierra Oncology\u2019s common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and against the approval of any acquisition\nproposal. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement\u037e (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger\u037e and (3) recommending that the\nmerger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Sierra Oncology Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed\nat the time, among other matters.

The number of shares of our common stock issuable for Sierra\noptions subject to performance-based vesting that have performance periods outstanding at the effective time will be deemed to be the number of shares\nissuable upon satisfaction of maximum achievement of performance criteria. The cash payment amount (less any required withholding and other taxes)\nwill be paid to the applicable Sierra option holder following the effective time of the merger, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

The increased Executive Severance\nPeriod is determined based on the executive\u2019s years of service with our company, as set forth below:\nYears of\nService\nCompleted\nLength of\nSeverance\nPeriod (in\nMonths)\n0\n13.5\n1\n14.4\n2\n15.3\n3\n16.2\n4\n17.1\n5\n18\nAdditionally, if the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within 12 months following a change of control, he or she will\nbe entitled to full vesting of all outstanding equity and equity-based awards, except that any equity and equity-based awards that vest based on the\nachievement of performance criteria shall vest in accordance with the change of control provisions in the applicable award agreement (or, if no such\nprovisions exist, shall vest in full).\nGeneral Severance and Change in Control Benefit Matters\nAll severance and severance-related acceleration benefits described above are subject to the named executive officer\u2019s execution and non-\nrevocation of a release of claims in favor of us. Under the employment agreements, the named executive officers are also subject to covenants regarding\nconfidentiality and prohibition on solicitation of our employees or independent contractors or the business of our customers or prospective customers\nfor a period of one year following the termination of employment.\nUnder the employment agreements, in the event the severance payments and other benefits payable to an executive constitute \u201cparachute\npayments\u201d under Section 280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and would be subject to the applicable excise tax, then the executive\u2019s severance\npayments and benefits will be either (i) delivered in full or (ii) delivered to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such payments or\nbenefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the receipt by executive on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of benefits.\n60\nTable of Contents\nUnder the employment agreements, \u201ccause\u201d generally means: (i) conviction (including a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere) of any felony or any\nother crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude\u037e (ii) commission or attempted commission of or participation in a fraud or act of dishonesty or\nmisrepresentation against us that results (or could reasonably be expected to result) in material harm or injury to our business or reputation\u037e (iii) material\nviolation of any contract or agreement between the executive and us, or of any of our policies, or of any statutory duty the executive owes to us,\nincluding, for Dr. Dilly a violation of our code of conduct, which, with respect to Dr. Dilly, is not remedied within 30 business days of notice of such\nviolation\u037e (iv) conduct that constitutes gross insubordination, incompetence or habitual neglect of duties, or, for Dr. Dilly, gross insubordination,\nincompetence or habitual neglect of the specific lawful directives of the Sierra Oncology Board which are consistent with the scope of his duties and\nresponsibilities, and that results in, or for executive officers other than Dr. Dilly, that results in or could reasonably be expected to have resulted in,\nmaterial harm to our business or reputation, if not remedied within 30 days of notice\u037e or (v) for Mr. Jagpal, any other conduct or circumstance that would\namount to just cause at common law.\nUnder the employment agreements, \u201cchange of control\u201d generally means: (i) a sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets\u037e (ii) our consolidation or merger with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate\nreorganization, in which our stockholders immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, own less than 50% of the outstanding voting\npower of the surviving entity following the consolidation, merger or reorganization\u037e or (iii) any transaction (or series of related transactions involving a\nperson or entity, or a group of affiliated persons or entities) in which in excess of 50% of our then-outstanding voting power is transferred, subject to\ncertain exceptions.\nUnder the employment agreements, \u201cgood reason\u201d generally means resignation of employment within 60 days (90 days for Dr. Dilly) after the\noccurrence of any of the following events that is not corrected within 30 days after we receive written notice that any of the following events have\noccurred: (i) without the executive\u2019s written consent, a material diminution of the executive\u2019s duties, position or responsibilities or, with respect to Dr.\nDilly, title, provided, however, that a mere change in title or reporting relationship following a change of control will not by itself constitute good reason,\nand, for executive officers other than Mr. Dilly, the acquisition of Sierra Oncology and subsequent conversion to a division or unit of the acquiring entity\nwill not by itself result in a diminution\u037e (ii) without the executive\u2019s written consent, a reduction in base salary or, with respect to Dr. Dilly, bonus\nopportunity, as in effect immediately prior to such reduction by more than 10%, unless such reduction is also applicable to all other senior executives\n(with respect to Dr. Dilly, such reduction to all other senior executives must be of no more than 15% to qualify for this exception)\u037e (iii) our material\nviolation of any contract or agreement between

place of employment as of the date of the executive\u2019s employment\nagreement with us.\nImpact of Corporate Transaction or Change in Control under Equity Plans\nOur 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2015 Plan\u201d) and our 2018 Equity Inducement Plan (\u201c2018 Plan\u201d), each provide that in the event of a \u201ccorporate\ntransaction\u201d as defined under the applicable plan, any or all outstanding awards may be assumed or replaced by the successor corporation, including\nthrough the substitution of equity awards or substantially similar consideration. In the event that the successor or acquiring corporation does not\nassume, convert, replace or substitute awards, then such awards will fully vest immediately prior to the corporate transaction, and either the award holder\nwill be notified that such award will become fully exercisable, if applicable, for a specified period prior to the transaction and will then terminate upon the\nexpiration of the specified period of time, or the award will be cancelled upon the occurrence of the corporate transaction in exchange for cash of\nequivalent value.\nOur 2015 Plan provides that all awards granted to non-employee directors automatically accelerate vesting in full immediately prior to the\nconsummation of a \u201ccorporate transaction.\u201d The merger is a \u201ccorporate transaction\u201d under the 2015 Plan and the 2018 Plan.\n61\nTable of Contents\nSimilarly, under our 2008 Stock Plan (\u201c2008 Plan\u201d), in the event of a merger or \u201cchange in control,\u201d as defined under the 2008 Plan, each\noutstanding award will be assumed or substituted by the successor corporation or its parent or subsidiary, except that if a successor corporation or its\nparent or subsidiary does not assume or substitute an equivalent award for any outstanding award, then such award will fully vest, and such award will\nbecome fully exercisable, if applicable, for a specified period prior to the transaction. The award will then terminate upon the expiration of the specified\nperiod of time. All awards granted under our 2008 Plan are fully vested.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger\nthat may be paid or become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Please see the previous portions of this\nsection for further information regarding this compensation with respect to certain of our executive officers.\nThe amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable to our named executive officers assuming, solely for\npurposes of this table, that the merger was consummated on March 31, 2022, and in the case of each named executive officer, that the named executive\nofficer\u2019s employment is terminated by Sierra Oncology without cause or by the named executive officer for good reason, in each case, on that date.\nSierra\u2019s named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, tax reimbursement or other perquisites or benefits in\nconnection with the merger. The values in this table assume no reduction under the terms of the employment agreements for any payments that may\nconstitute \u201cparachute payments\u201d under Section 280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.\nSome of the amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the merger. In addition to the assumptions\nregarding the consummation date of the merger and the termination of employment, these estimates are based on certain other assumptions that are\ndescribed in the footnotes accompanying the table below.

This agreement was entered into independently of the merger and for purposes of\nthis table, we assume that none of the consideration received by Dr. Kowalski in connection with the transition agreement is contingent upon or\nrelated to the merger. Under the transition agreement, Dr. Kowalski received or is in the process of receiving a total severance payment of $474,986,\nrepresenting twelve months base salary, less applicable withholdings, paid over twelve months from the termination date, plus a total of $17,290 to\nassist Dr. Kowalski\u2019s out-of-pocket healthcare costs, at a rate of $1,330 per month, less applicable withholdings, for thirteen months from the\ntermination date. Dr. Kowalski also entered into a consulting agreement with Sierra Oncology following the termination of his employment through\nJune 30, 2023, pursuant to which he will be paid $400 per hour of consulting service provided. Under the transition agreement, Dr. Kowalski agreed\nto permanently forfeit the unvested portion of each time-based Sierra option as of the termination date. Dr. Kowalski\u2019s performance-based Sierra\noptions remain outstanding following his termination and will accelerate vesting and be cancelled in accordance with the merger agreement.\nEmployment and Non-Compete Arrangements Following the Merger\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, none of Sierra Oncology\u2019s executive officers have (1) reached an understanding on potential employment or\nother retention terms with the surviving corporation or with GSK or Acquisition Sub\u037e or (2) entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements\nregarding employment or other retention with the surviving corporation or with GSK or Acquisition Sub to be effective following the consummation of\nthe merger. However, prior to the effective time of the merger, GSK or Acquisition Sub may have discussions regarding employment, compensation or\nother retention arrangements or terms and may enter into definitive agreements, or amendments to definitive agreements currently in effect, regarding\nemployment, compensation, retention or other restrictive covenants with certain of Sierra Oncology\u2019s employees to be effective as of the effective time of\nthe merger. Certain currently contemplated arrangements are described below. However, the parties may choose to revise the terms of, or not enter into,\nthese arrangements.\nStephen Dilly Non-Competition Agreement\nIt is currently expected that Dr. Dilly will enter into a non-competition agreement in favor of GSK which will become effective as of the closing,\nprovided the closing occurs on or before March 1, 2023. Under the expected terms of this agreement, Dr. Dilly would receive a payment of $100,000 in\nexchange for the non-compete, which shall be paid to Dr. Dilly within five (5) business days of closing.\n63\nTable of Contents\nChristina Thomson and Barbara Klencke Employment Agreement Amendments\nIt is currently expected that each of Ms. Thomson and Dr. Klencke\u2019s employment agreements will be amended to extend the non-competition period\nrequired under such agreements to 18 months following their termination of employment. Their current employment agreements restrict competition\nthrough a period of 12 months following termination of employment for Ms. Thomson and during employment for Dr. Klencke. If entered into, the\namendments will become effective as of the closing, provided the closing occurs on or before March 1, 2023. Under the expected term of the agreement,\nMs. Thomson and Dr. Klencke each would receive a payment of $5,000 in exchange for the extended period, which would be paid to the applicable\nexecutive within five (5) business days of closing.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger",

The following\nsummary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that our stockholders exercise their appraisal rights\nunder Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A\nperson having a beneficial interest in shares of our common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee,\nmust act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a\nbank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee to ensure\nthat appraisal rights are exercised. Stockholders should carefully review the full text of Section 262 as well as the information discussed below.\nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s shares to Sierra Oncology prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement\u037e (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time of the merger\u037e and (4) otherwise comply with the\nprocedures and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of our common stock appraised by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of\n64Table of Contents\nthe \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,\ntogether with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment. However, after an\nappraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal\nproceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of our common stock for which appraisal\nrights have been pursued or perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as measured in accordance with subsection\n(g) of Section 262\u037e or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the\n\u201cownership thresholds.\u201d Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal\naward will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal\nReserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time before the entry of\njudgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will accrue\nthereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such\nvoluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days\nprior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and\ninclude in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Sierra Oncology\u2019s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are\navailable in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B. In connection with the merger, any\nholder of shares of our common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review\nAnnex B carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights\nunder the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger agreement\nwithout interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares\nof our common stock, Sierra Oncology believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of\nlegal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common stock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Sierra Oncology a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger agreement at the special\nmeeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a\nstockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger)\u037e and\n\u2022\na stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on\nbehalf of such person) or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the\nvalue of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of the merger (the surviving corporation is under no\nobligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so).\nIn addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal\nrights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\n65\nTable of Contents\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, each of\nour stockholders who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement, abstain or not\nvote his, her or its shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Sierra Oncology, before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the\nspecial meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. In addition, that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of\nthe adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by\nmail or via the Internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed\nwritten demands for appraisal. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is\nmade and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting\ninstructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder\u2019s right of\nappraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption\nof the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to\nadopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand\nfor appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of\nthe merger agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of\nthe merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A\ndemand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform\nSierra Oncology of the identity of the holder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. If the shares\nare owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf\nof the record owner, and if such shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should\nbe executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand\nfor appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the\ndemand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN \u201cSTREET NAME\u201d BY A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE AND WHO WISH\nTO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO\nDETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL\nOF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH\nAS A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN\nA TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\n66\nTable of Contents\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nSierra Oncology, Inc.\n1820 Gateway Drive, Suite 110\nSan Mateo, California 94404\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for\nappraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, by\ndelivering to Sierra Oncology, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the\ndemand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this shall\nnot affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time of the merger. If Sierra Oncology, as the\nsurviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any\nstockholder who withdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of\nChancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the\nappraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered\npursuant to the merger agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each record holder of shares of\nour common stock who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of our common stock\nwho has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 (or the beneficial owner of such shares) may commence an\nappraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed\nby a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving\ncorporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will\nfile a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of our common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of our\ncommon stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of\nour common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262\ncould nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who has complied with the requirements for an\nappraisal of such holder\u2019s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement\nsetting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which Sierra Oncology has\nreceived demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation\n67\nTable of Contents\nmust send this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a\nstatement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of our\ncommon stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or\nrequest from the surviving corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder\nof record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of our common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation,\nthe surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list\ncontaining the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their\nshares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given\nto the surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. Any such notice shall also be given by\none or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,\nDelaware or any other publication which the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving\ncorporation.\nAfter notice to dissenting stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the\nstockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may\nrequire the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the\npendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the\nproceedings as to such stockholder.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (1) the total\nnumber of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as\nmeasured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of the shares for which appraisal rights\nhave been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of our common stock entitled to appraisal, and that at least one of the ownership\nthresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in\naccordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such\nproceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising\nfrom the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In\ndetermining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be\ncompounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time\nduring the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at\nany time prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking\nappraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on\nthe sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the\nshares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal\nproceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value\n68\nTable of Contents\nby any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court\nstated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the\nenterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.\nSection 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede &\nCo. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of\nvalue,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme\nCourt of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date\nof the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\ncould be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares\nand that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an\nopinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Sierra Oncology believes that the per share price is fair, no\nrepresentation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should\nrecognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the per share price. Neither Sierra\nOncology nor GSK anticipates offering more than the per share price to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Sierra Oncology and GSK\nreserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for\npurposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of our common stock is less than the per share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if\nneither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will\ncease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of\na stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the\nappraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value\nof all the shares entitled to an appraisal. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly\nwithdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of our common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of\nthe merger into the right to receive the per share price as provided in the merger agreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such\nholder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds\nabove has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written\nwithdrawal of such holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in accordance with\nSection 262.\nFrom and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 will be entitled to\nvote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an\nappraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the stockholders\nseeking appraisal rights or if such stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal\nand an acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval\n69\nTable of Contents\nof the surviving corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such\nterms as the Court deems just\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the\nmerger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. In\nthat event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the merger agreement, without interest and\nless any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before\nattempting to exercise those rights.",

This\ndiscussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d), U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the\nCode, court decisions, published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other applicable authorities, all as in\neffect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This\ndiscussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of our common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,\nproperty held for investment purposes).\nThis discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their\nparticular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:\n\u2022\ntax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as\nfinancial institutions\u037e tax-exempt organizations\u037e S corporations, partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or\npass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e insurance companies\u037e mutual funds\u037e dealers in stocks and securities\u037e traders in\nsecurities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities\u037e regulated investment companies\u037e real estate\ninvestment trusts\u037e entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules\u037e holders who hold their common stock as \u201cqualified small business stock\u201d\nfor purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code\u037e Non-U.S. Holders that own (directly or by attribution) more than five percent of our\ncommon stock\u037e or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction\ntransaction\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory transaction or pursuant to the exercise of\noptions or warrants\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to U.S. Holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located,\norganized or resident outside the United States\u037e\n70Table of Contents\n\u2022\ntax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the shares of our\ncommon stock being taken into account in an \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d (as defined in the Code)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any\u037e\n\u2022\nany state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences\u037e or\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend\nupon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of our common stock and partners therein\nshould consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.\nNo ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger described below. If the IRS\ncontests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO\nANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES\nRELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER\nFEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons\nas defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as\na United States person.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and\nthe U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount\nthat such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s\nholding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to\nlong-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder\nacquired different blocks of shares of our common stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and\nholding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.\n71\nTable of Contents\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder\nnor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable\nincome tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such\ngain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a\ncorporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax\ntreaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the completion of the\nmerger, and certain other conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a\nlower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e or\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the\nmerger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S.\nHolder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification\nof such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (b) otherwise establishes an\nexemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will\ngenerally be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nA U.S. Holder may be required to retain records related to such holder\u2019s common stock and file with its U.S. federal income tax return, for the taxable\nyear that includes the Merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the merger.\nFATCA\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder (which we refer to as\n\u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under\nthese rules) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the\nU.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of\nsuch institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a\nU.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a\ncertification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement between the United\nStates and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or\ncredits of such taxes.\n72\nTable of Contents\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding\ntax of 30 percent applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the\nU.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nHolders of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on the\ndisposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

The parties filed a notification and report form with the FTC and DOJ on April 28, 2022. A\ntransaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filing of their\nrespective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. The initial waiting period under the HSR Act is set to expire at 11:59\np.m., Eastern time, on May 31, 2022.\nSierra Oncology and GSK have each agreed to cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with the making of filings with the FTC, the DOJ\nor the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which a filing is made pursuant to other antitrust laws or other laws that provide for\nreview of the cross-border acquisition of any interest in or assets of a business (including for national security or defense reasons) (which we refer to,\ncollectively, as \u201cregulatory laws\u201d). Sierra Oncology and GSK have each also agreed to (1) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause\nthe other to be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the governmental\nauthorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is made\u037e and (2) use its respective reasonable best efforts to take all action\nnecessary to, as soon as practicable, (a) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other\nantitrust laws or other regulatory laws applicable to the merger, (b) obtain any required approvals, consents, and clearances pursuant to any antitrust\nlaws applicable to the merger and to remove any court or regulatory orders under any regulatory laws impeding the ability to consummate the merger by\nthe termination date (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination of the Merger Agreement\u201d), and\n(c) certify compliance with any request for additional information or documentary material from any governmental authority with respect to the merger\npursuant to the HSR Act or other regulatory laws.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the\nDOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws (or the relevant authorities for filings made under other regulatory laws) as it deems necessary or\ndesirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to\nlicense, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or\n73Table of Contents\nafter the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under\nits antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of\nsubstantial assets of Sierra Oncology or GSK. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nOne or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary\napprovals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory\napprovals, which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how\nlong it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial\nperiod of time between the approval by our stockholders and the completion of the merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances\nand approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of\nadditional conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result\nin the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.\nThe Support Agreements",

The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger\nagreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement (1) were made only for\npurposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be\nsubject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Sierra Oncology, GSK and Acquisition Sub in connection\nwith negotiating the terms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally\napplicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to GSK and Acquisition\nSub by Sierra Oncology in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the\nmerger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Sierra Oncology and GSK and Acquisition Sub rather than to establish\nmatters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the\nrepresentations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement\nmay have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in\ncircumstance or otherwise. Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of\nSierra Oncology, GSK or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement.

The merger agreement is described below, and\nincluded as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual\ninformation regarding Sierra Oncology, GSK, Acquisition Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants\nand other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and\nin our filings with the SEC regarding Sierra Oncology and our business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or\nwaiver of all of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but\nsubject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions\u037e or (2) at such other time agreed to by Sierra Oncology, GSK and Acquisition Sub.

In each case, base compensation and target incentive\ncompensation opportunity will not be decreased during the Comparability Period below the level applicable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time\nfor any Continuing Employee employed during that period.

If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,\nthe provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.\n(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\n(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a\nmeeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the\nrecord date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with \u00a7 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for\nwhich appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of\nthe constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock\ncorporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares shall deliver to the\ncorporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares\u037e provided\nthat a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly\ndesignated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder\nand that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or\nconsolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein\nprovided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each\nstockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or\nconsolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective\u037e or\n(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \u00a7 228, \u00a7 251(h), \u00a7 253, or \u00a7 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation\nbefore the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the\nholders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or\nconsolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall\ninclude in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Such\nnotice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the\nmerger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a\nmerger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20\ndays after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e\nprovided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any)\nexpressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the\nstockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of\nthe effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of\nthe merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to\nappraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to\nall such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following\nthe sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the\noffer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the\nB-2\nTable of Contents\nfirst notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such\nholder\u2019s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation\nthat is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated\ntherein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record\ndate that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the\nmerger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the\nrecord date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.\n(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has\ncomplied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by\nfiling a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at\nany time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon\nthe merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the\nrequirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the\nmerger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or,\nin the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in \u00a7 251(h)\n(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and,\nin either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall\nbe given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or\nwithin 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.\nNotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee\non behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which\nshall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names\nand addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been\nreached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied\nby such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such\npetition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated.\nSuch notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in\nthe City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be\napproved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.\n(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled\nto appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by\ncertificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any\nstockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If\nB-3\nTable of Contents\nimmediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are\navailable were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled\nto appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for\nappraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger\nwas approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of\nthe Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair\nvalue of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with\ninterest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant\nfactors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the\neffective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of\npayment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application\nby the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,\nproceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on\nthe list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of\nstock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not\nentitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the\nstockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of\nholders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court\u2019s decree may be\nenforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of\nany state.\n(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances.\nUpon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal\nproceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all\nthe shares entitled to an appraisal.\n(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection\n(d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except\ndividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation)\u037e provided,\nhowever, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to\nthe surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or\nconsolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with\nthe written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal\nproceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned\nupon such terms as the\nB-4\nTable of Contents\nCourt deems just\u037e provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or\nconsolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.\n(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they\nassented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-5\nTable of Contents\nAnnex C",
