In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who\nreceives cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss in\nan amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the Merger and (ii) the U.S.\nholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Common Stock exchanged therefor.\nThis proxy statement contains a general discussion of U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the\nMerger. No information is provided with respect to the tax consequences of the Merger under any U.S. federal law\nother than income tax laws (including, for example the U.S. federal estate, gift, Medicare and alternative minimum\ntax laws), or any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. Consequently, holders of Common Stock should consult\ntheir tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the Merger relevant to their particular circumstances, including\nthe applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of\nchanges in those laws.\nRegulatory Matters (See page 64)\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to:\n\u2022\nany applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof, including under any agreement between a party\nand a governmental authority agreeing not to consummate the Merger prior to a certain date) under the\nHSR Act relating to the consummation of the Merger having expired or been terminated\u037e\n10\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\neach other clearance or approval under any antitrust law in the jurisdiction set forth in the specified section\nof the Company Disclosure Schedules shall have been obtained (or deemed obtained) or their respective\nauthority concluded no jurisdiction\u037e and\n\u2022\n(i) no governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has entered any order that remains in effect and no\nlaw has been adopted or is effective, in each case, that temporarily or permanently prohibits, enjoins or\nmakes illegal the consummation of the Merger or (ii) no legal proceeding has been brought by a\ngovernmental authority that remains pending and that seeks an order that would impose a Legal Restraint.\nUnder the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until\nrequired information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice\n(\u201cAntitrust Division\u201d) and the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and statutory waiting period requirements have\nbeen satisfied. On April 14, 2023, both Heska and Acquiror filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with\nthe Antitrust Division and the FTC. The waiting period under the HSR Act is expected to expire on May 15, 2023\nunless earlier terminated or extended by the issuance of a request for additional information and documentary\nmaterial (a \u201cSecond Request\u201d) to the parties by the FTC or the Antitrust Division prior to that time. If the FTC or the\nAntitrust Division issues a Second Request, the waiting period with respect to the Merger will be extended for an\nadditional period of 30 calendar days following both parties\u2019 substantial compliance with that request unless earlier\nterminated by the FTC or the Antitrust Division. After that time, the waiting period may be extended only by court\norder or with the consent of the parties. At any time before or after the consummation of any such transactions, the\nFTC or the Antitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust laws of the United States as it deems\nnecessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the Merger.\nBeneficial Ownership (See page 86)\nAt the close of business on the Record Date, Heska\u2019s directors and executive officers and their affiliates, as a\ngroup, beneficially owned and were entitled to vote approximately 990,307 shares of Common Stock, collectively\nrepresenting approximately 9.1% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on that date. Heska currently expects\nthat all of its directors and executive officers will vote their shares \u201c FOR \u201d the Merger Proposal, \u201c FOR \u201d the\nAdvisory Compensation Proposal and \u201c FOR \u201d the Adjournment Proposal (if necessary).

This appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration. Any\nholder of Common Stock intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other things, submit a written demand for\nan appraisal to us prior to the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting and must not vote or otherwise\nsubmit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the\nDGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights.

            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers briefly address some commonly asked questions about the Special\nMeeting and the Merger. They may not include all the information that is important to Heska stockholders. Heska\nstockholders should carefully read this entire proxy statement, including the annexes and the other documents\nreferred to herein and incorporated by reference.\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\nA:\nYou are receiving this proxy statement because Heska has agreed to be acquired pursuant to an all-cash merger\ntransaction. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into\nHeska, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Heska will continue as the surviving\ncorporation in the Merger (the \u201cSurviving Corporation\u201d) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror. The Merger\nAgreement governs the terms of the Merger of Merger Sub and Heska and is attached to this proxy statement as\nAnnex A. You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Heska\nBoard in favor of the Merger Proposal and the other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting.\nIn order to complete the Merger, among other things, Heska stockholders must adopt the Merger Agreement in\naccordance with the DGCL. This proxy statement, which you should carefully read in its entirety, contains\nimportant information about the Special Meeting, the Merger and other matters.\nQ:\nWhat will happen in the Merger?\nA:\nThe Merger Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the proposed Merger. Under the Merger\nAgreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Heska, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will\ncease and Heska will continue as the Surviving Corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror. The\nMerger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. For a more complete discussion of the\nproposed Merger, its effects and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, please see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat are Heska stockholders being asked to vote on?\nA:\nHeska is holding the Special Meeting to vote on the Merger Proposal, pursuant to which each outstanding\nshare of Common Stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, other\nthan shares held in the treasury of Heska, shares held, directly or indirectly, by Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub,\nor any wholly-owned subsidiary of Heska immediately prior to the Effective Time, or shares of Restricted Stock\n(the treatment of which is described elsewhere in this proxy statement) or shares held by a holder that properly\nperfects its appraisal rights under the DGCL. Heska stockholders will also be asked to approve the Advisory\nCompensation Proposal (on a non-binding, advisory basis) and the Adjournment Proposal.\nYour vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of Common Stock that you own. The approval of\nthe Merger Proposal is a condition to the obligations of Mars and Heska to complete the Merger.\nQ:\nHow important is my vote as a Heska stockholder?\nA:\nYour vote \u201cFOR\u201d each proposal presented at the Special Meeting is very important, and you are encouraged to\nsubmit a proxy as soon as possible. The Merger cannot be completed without the approval of the Merger\nProposal by the Heska stockholders.\nQ:\nWhat constitutes a quorum, and what vote is required to approve each proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date must be\nrepresented at the Special Meeting in person or by proxy in order to constitute a quorum. Under the Bylaws, for\npurposes of determining whether shares are present and entitled to vote with respect to any particular subject\nmatter, abstentions and nonvotes with respect to such subject matter will be treated as not present or entitled to\nvote on such subject matter, but will be treated as present and entitled to vote for all other\n13TABLE OF CONTENTS\npurposes. Virtual attendance by stockholders of record at the Special Meeting will constitute presence in person\nfor the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting.\nShares of beneficial owners who hold such shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker, trust or other\nnominee and who fail to give voting instructions to their bank, broker, trust or other nominee will not be counted\ntoward quorum. Beneficial owners who virtually attend the Special Meeting will not count toward a quorum\nunless they instruct their shares or hold a legal proxy executed by their bank, broker, trust or other nominee.\nIf a quorum is present, approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of\nthe outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, a Heska\nstockholder\u2019s abstention from voting or the failure of a Heska stockholder to vote (including the failure of a\nHeska stockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to give any\nvoting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee) will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe Merger Proposal.\nIf a quorum is present, approval of each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Advisory Compensation Proposal\nrequires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock as of the Record Date entitled to\nvote thereon and present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting.

Because brokers, banks, trusts and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary\nvoting authority with respect to any of the three proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting, if a beneficial\nowner of shares of Common Stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank,\ntrust or other nominee with respect to any of the proposals, then those shares will not be present in person or\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.\nIf you provide voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee on one or more of the proposals\nbut not on one or more of the other proposals, then your shares will not be treated as present or entitled to vote\nfor the purposes of determining a quorum on any proposal for which you fail to provide instructions, and will\nnot be voted on any such proposal, but will be treated as present and entitled to vote for the purposes of\ndetermining a quorum, and will be voted on any proposal for which you provide instructions. To make sure that\nyour shares are voted with respect to each of the proposals, you should instruct your bank, broker, trust or\nother nominee how you wish to vote your shares in accordance with the procedures provided by your bank,\nbroker, trust or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares.\nThe effect of not instructing your bank, broker, trust or other nominee how you wish to vote your shares on\nany of the proposals will be the same as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal and will not have any effect on\nthe outcome of the Adjournment Proposal or the Advisory Compensation Proposal.\nIf you instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares on some\nproposals but not the Merger Proposal, the resulting broker non-vote will have the same effect as voting\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal. \nIf you instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares on some\nproposals but not the Advisory Compensation Proposal, the resulting broker non-vote will not have any effect\non the outcome of Advisory Compensation Proposal.\nIf you instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares on some\nproposals but not the Adjournment Proposal, the resulting broker non-vote will not have any effect on the\noutcome of Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the Special Meeting?\nA:\nIf you hold shares of Common Stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d and also directly in your name as a stockholder of record\nor otherwise, or if you hold shares of Common Stock in more than one brokerage account, you may receive more\nthan one set of voting materials relating to the Special Meeting.\nRecord Holders.

If your shares of Common Stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank, trust or\nother nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee as to what action, if\nany, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the Merger\nConsideration. Do not send in your certificates now.\nQ:\nI do not know where my stock certificate is-how will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares?\nA:\nIf the Merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the Merger will\ninclude the procedures that you must follow to receive the Merger Consideration, including, in the case of\nholders of stock certificates, if you cannot locate your stock certificate(s).

Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of\nproxies should be addressed to:\nHeska Corporation\nAttn: Corporate Secretary\n3760 Rocky Mountain Avenue\nLoveland, Colorado 80538\nFor more information, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting of Heska\u2019s Stockholders -\nRevocation of Proxies.\u201d\nQ:\nIf I hold my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d can I change my voting instructions after I have submitted voting\ninstructions to my bank, broker, trust or other nominee?\nA:\nIf your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, trust or other nominee and you previously provided voting\ninstructions to your bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your\nbank, broker, trust or other nominee to revoke or change your voting instructions.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting will be announced at the Special Meeting. In addition,\nwithin four business days of the Special Meeting, Heska intends to file the final voting results of the Special\nMeeting with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights?\nA:\nYes. Under Section 262 of the DGCL, a stockholder who does not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal will be\nentitled to seek appraisal of its shares if such stockholder takes certain actions and certain criteria are satisfied.\nFor more information, see the section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d and Annex E of this proxy statement.\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nDo any of the officers or directors of Heska have interests in the Merger that may differ from or be in addition\nto my interests as a Heska stockholder?\nA:\nA:Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Heska Board that Heska stockholders vote to approve the\nMerger Proposal, Heska stockholders should be aware that Heska\u2019s directors and executive officers may have\ninterests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Heska stockholders generally.\nThe Heska Board was aware of these interests and considered, among other matters, in evaluating and\napproving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending the approval of the Merger Proposal\nand the Advisory Compensation Proposal to Heska\u2019s stockholders. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202f\nInterests of Heska\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to vote on the Advisory Compensation Proposal?\nA:\nSEC rules require Heska to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain payments that\nwill or may be made to Heska\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Approval of the\nAdvisory Compensation Proposal is not required to complete the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you transfer your shares of Common Stock\nafter the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your\nright to vote at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\nA:\nHeska and Mars are working to be in a position to complete the Merger as quickly as possible after the Special\nMeeting. Heska currently anticipates that the Merger will be completed in the second half of 2023. In order to\ncomplete the merger, we must obtain the required Heska stockholder approval, approval under the HSR Act and\ncertain other regulatory approvals, and a number of other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement must\nbe satisfied or waived. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Conditions to Consummation of the\nMerger.\u201d Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Merger will be completed at all, or if completed, that it\nwill be completed in the second half of 2023.\nQ:\nWhat are the United States federal income tax considerations of the Merger for Heska stockholders?\nA: The receipt of cash by U.S. h olders (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202f U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsiderations\u201d) in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. h older\nwho receives cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize capital gain or\nloss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the Merger and (ii)\nthe U.S. h older\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Common Stock exchanged therefor.   For a more detailed summary of\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences of the M erger, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger - U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Considerations\u201d beginning on page 62 .\nThis proxy statement contains a general discussion of U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the\nMerger. No information is provided with respect to the tax consequences of the Merger under any U.S. federal\nlaw other than income tax laws (including, for example the U.S. federal estate, gift, Medicare and alternative\nminimum tax laws), or any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. Consequently, holders of Common Stock\nshould consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the Merger relevant to their particular\ncircumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-\nU.S. or other tax laws and of changes in those laws.\nQ:\nWhat should I do now?\nA:\nYou should read this proxy statement carefully and, in its entirety, including the annexes, and return your\ncompleted, signed and dated proxy card by mail in the enclosed postage-paid envelope, or you may submit your\nvoting instructions by telephone or over the Internet as soon as possible so that your shares will be voted in\naccordance with your instructions.\n20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more\nstockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance\nnotice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of\nthe meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of\ncommon stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you\nmay have already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you\nhave any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a\nseparate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to\nrevoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.\nQ:\nWho will count the vote?\nA: A representative of Computershare Trust Company, N.A.

These reviews have included consideration by Heska\u2019s senior\nmanagement and the Heska Board of potential strategic alternatives, including acquisitions, business combinations\nand other strategic transactions.\nFrom time to time, Heska\u2019s senior officers have met with other industry participants, including Mars and certain\nother strategic companies, which include the strategic companies that we refer to as Party A and Party B, to discuss\npotential commercial and strategic transactions.\nIn mid-2021, representatives of Heska, including Kevin S.

At VMX Veterinary Meeting & Expo, Mr. Wilson discussed commercial opportunities and\ngeneral market observations with the representatives of each of Party A and Mars.

Eyl, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer of Heska and President of Scil Animal\nCare, met with Ms. Greene, Margaret Ma, Director, Corporate Development of Mars, and Giambattista Martano, Chief\nFinancial Officer of Mars Science & Diagnostics, in New York, New York to discuss potential\n31TABLE OF CONTENTS\ncommercial opportunities between the companies. At this meeting, the representatives of Mars discussed the\nstrategic rationale for a potential business combination transaction between Mars and Heska. No proposal was made\nduring this discussion but the representatives of Mars suggested organizing a follow-up discussion in the coming\nweeks.\nOn February 13, 2023, Catherine Grassman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Heska, had a\ntelephone call with Mr. Martano and Ms. Ma during which the representatives of Heska responded to certain\nclarifying questions concerning Heska\u2019s publicly available financial information. Following the call, Mr. Wilson\ntransmitted to Ms. Greene and Ms. Ma materials containing certain financial information of Heska, subject to the\nCommercial NDA.\nOn February 20, 2023, Heska received a written proposal from Mars (referred to as the \u201cFebruary 20 Letter\u201d) to\nacquire Heska in an all-cash transaction at a price of $112.50 per share (representing approximately $1.36 billion in\nequity value, on a fully diluted basis, as of the date of the February 20 Letter). The February 20 Letter noted that the\nproposed transaction would not be subject to a financing condition and would be funded through a combination of\ncash on hand and/or bank facilities accessible to Mars on short notice. Mars also indicated in the February 20 Letter\nits desire to move quickly toward a definitive agreement with Heska and requested a four week exclusivity period.\nTogether with the February 20 Letter, Mars delivered an exclusivity agreement proposed to be entered into by Mars\nand Heska as well as a list of high priority due diligence items.\nOn February 21, 2023, the Heska Board and representatives of Heska\u2019s senior management met for dinner in\nadvance of the regularly scheduled Heska Board meeting the following day.

The\ndirectors and representatives of each of Heska\u2019s senior management and Gibson Dunn then discussed Mars\u2019s\nhistoric acquisitions of public companies, its request for exclusivity, potential alternative buyers, and possible\ntransaction terms should the Heska Board determine to move forward with a negotiation with Mars. After discussion,\nthe Heska Board instructed management and Gibson Dunn to negotiate and enter into a confidentiality agreement\nincluding a customary standstill provision with Mars to enable further discussions with Mars. The Heska Board also\ndirected management to engage financial advisors to assist the Heska Board in evaluating the financial terms of the\nFebruary 20 Letter. The Heska Board and management discussed the importance of obtaining financial advice from\ninvestment banks that were sophisticated in the animal health sector and know Heska well, but also ensuring the\nindependence of such advisors. In that regard, the Heska Board and management discussed potentially engaging\nPiper Sandler, who had done significant work with Heska in the past. The Heska Board considered the fact that two of\nMr. Wilson\u2019s sons were employed by Piper Sandler and agreed that that fact would not present a disqualifying\nconflict of interest but that it may be advisable to also engage a second financial advisor. Following the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Heska senior management contacted representatives of certain investment banking firms,\nincluding each of BofA Securities and Piper Sandler, leading investment banks with long-standing relationships with\nHeska and significant experience in the animal health sector, to discuss their possible engagement in connection with\na potential change of control transaction with Mars. Heska subsequently engaged each of BofA Securities and Piper\nSandler to serve as co-financial advisors in connection with a potential change of control transaction.\nOn February 23, 2023, Mr. Wilson had a telephone call with Ms. Greene during which Mr. Wilson and Ms.\nGreene discussed the strategic rationale for a possible change of control transaction.

Representatives of Heska senior management subsequently relayed the contents of\nsuch letter to the Heska Board.\nOn February 28, 2023, Heska and Mars executed a confidentiality agreement that contained a customary\nstandstill provision and Mr. Providenti had a telephone call with Ms. Ma to discuss transaction process matters.\nOn March 2, 2023, representatives of BofA Securities delivered to Heska senior management a letter regarding\nBofA Securities\u2019 material investment banking relationships with Heska and Mars for the period from February 1, 2021\nto January 31, 2023.

Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited\nForecasted Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 39 for such forecasts. Representatives of each of BofA and\nPiper Sandler then reviewed their respective preliminary financial analysis of Heska based on publicly available\ninformation and certain strategic alternatives available to Heska, including a sale to other possible counterparties.\nRepresentatives of each of BofA Securities and Piper Sandler also reviewed certain other potential counterparties that\nmight be interested in a strategic transaction with Heska. The directors discussed whether to affirmatively reach out\nto other possible counterparties regarding a potential strategic transaction but considered that it was unlikely that\nanother party would make an offer as attractive as the February 20 Letter, noting that none of Party A, Party B or\nParty C (which parties included the strategic companies the Heska Board believed would be most likely to be\ninterested in a strategic transaction with Heska) had engaged in discussions regarding a potential change of control\ntransaction following their respective meetings with Mr. Wilson. The directors and representatives of each of senior\nmanagement, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler and Gibson Dunn discussed the February 20 Letter and Mars\u2019s request\nfor exclusivity, and the Heska Board and Mr. Wilson discussed seeking a price in the range of $115 to $125 per share\nin cash. The Heska Board directed Mr. Wilson to relay to Mars that the price in the February 20 Letter was not\nsufficient and also suggested that Mr. Wilson indicate that the Heska Board may be willing to grant Mars\u2019s request\nfor exclusivity in exchange for a \u201cgo shop\u201d in the definitive transaction agreement.\nOn March 4, 2023, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Providenti had a video conference with Ms. Greene and Ms. Ma during\nwhich they relayed that the price in the February 20 Letter was not sufficient but that the Heska Board may be open\nto a revised offer in the $122.50 to $125 range. Mr. Wilson also stated that the Heska Board may be willing to enter\ninto an exclusivity agreement with Mars only if Heska was entitled to a \u201cgo shop\u201d in the definitive transaction\nagreement but that Heska would not otherwise agree to exclusivity. Ms. Greene indicated that Mars would consider\nthe Heska Board\u2019s counteroffer and revert to Heska.\nOn March 6, 2023, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Providenti had a video conference with Ms. Ma and Ms. Greene to\nfurther discuss the Heska Board\u2019s counteroffer and Mars\u2019s request for exclusivity. Later on March 6, 2023, Mars\nsubmitted to Heska a revised written proposal (referred to as the \u201cMarch 6 Letter\u201d) to acquire Heska in an all-cash\ntransaction at a price of $120.00 per share (representing approximately $1.48 billion in equity value, on a fully diluted\nbasis, as of the date of the March 6 Letter) on terms otherwise substantially the same as the February 20 Letter.\nTogether with the March 6 Letter, Mars delivered a list of key due diligence topics and an exclusivity agreement\nproposed to be entered into by Mars and Heska (which were identical to those delivered with the February 20 Letter).\nOn March 7, 2023, representatives of Gibson Dunn had a telephone call with representatives of Skadden to\nclarify Mars\u2019s request for exclusivity and reiterated Mr. Wilson\u2019s earlier comment that Heska would only be willing to\nagree to exclusivity in exchange for a \u201cgo shop\u201d in the definitive transaction agreement.\nLater on March 7, 2023, the Heska Board held a special virtual meeting at which representatives of each of\nHeska\u2019s senior management, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler and Gibson Dunn were present to discuss the\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMarch 6 Letter.

The\nHeska Board thereafter authorized Heska senior management to move forward with the negotiation of a potential\nchange of control transaction with Mars on the basis of the March 6 Letter, including commencement of due\ndiligence and negotiation of definitive transaction documents. Heska and Mars did not enter into any exclusivity\narrangements that would have restricted Heska\u2019s ability to pursue alternative strategies or transactions.\nLater on March 8, 2023, Skadden delivered to Gibson Dunn the initial draft of the Merger Agreement for the\nproposed transaction. The draft Merger Agreement contemplated, among other things, (i) a non-solicitation\nprovision applicable to Heska that would allow the Heska Board, under certain circumstances, to change its\nrecommendation in the event of a superior proposal or intervening event\u037e (ii) a provision requiring the parties to the\nMerger Agreement to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all required regulatory approvals, subject to certain\nlimitations, but no reverse termination fee or other remedy in the event the transaction did not close due to a failure to\nobtain regulatory approval\u037e (iii) a termination fee (with the amount left blank) payable by Heska under certain\ncircumstances\u037e and (iv) a reference to voting agreements pursuant to which certain directors and/or members of\nmanagement would be required to vote their shares of Common Stock in favor of the Merger.\nOn March 9, 2023, Heska provided Mars and its advisors with access to an electronic due diligence data room.\nOn March 10, 2023, Heska and Mars executed a \u201cclean team\u201d addendum to the confidentiality agreement.

Later on March 15, 2023, representatives of\nSkadden sent an initial draft of a voting agreement to be executed by certain directors and members of management.\nOver the next several days, representatives of each of Skadden and Gibson Dunn negotiated and exchanged markups\nof such voting agreement.\nOn March 22, 2023, the board of directors of Mars reviewed the terms of the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby and unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby.\nOn March 24, 2023, the Heska Board held a special virtual meeting at which representatives of each of Heska\u2019s\nsenior management, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler and Gibson Dunn were present.

The revised drafts did not address the size of the\ntermination fees or the regulatory construct. Late on March 29, 2023, Skadden sent a revised draft of the Merger\nAgreement to Gibson Dunn that, among other things, (i) provided that no divestiture of any of Mars\u2019s assets or\nassets of Heska generating more than $30 million in revenue for fiscal year 2022 would be required to\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nobtain regulatory approvals\u037e (ii) included a termination fee payable by Heska of 3.75% of Heska\u2019s equity value under\ncertain customary circumstances\u037e and (iii) removed Acquiror\u2019s obligation to pay a reverse termination fee and enter\ninto a commercial arrangement with Heska if the Merger Agreement was terminated due to failure to obtain regulatory\napprovals.\nOn March 30, 2023, Gibson Dunn sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Skadden that, among other\nthings (i) provided that no divestiture of Heska generating more than $30 million in revenues in the United States for\nfiscal year 2022 would be required to obtain regulatory approvals\u037e (ii) provided for a termination fee payable by Heska\nof $30 million\u037e and (iii) reinstated the remedies construct under which Acquiror would be required to both pay a\nreverse termination fee of $100 million and enter into a commercial arrangement with Heska if the Merger Agreement\nwas terminated due to failure to obtain regulatory approvals.

Following transmission of the draft Merger Agreement to Skadden, Mr. Providenti had a telephone call\nwith Ms. Ma during which he stated that Heska was requesting the proposed reverse termination fee and commercial\narrangement remedy in connection with a failure to obtain required regulatory approvals and that, if this remedy was\nrejected, the Heska Board would require greater per share cash consideration in exchange for bearing greater\nregulatory risk. Ms. Ma rejected Mr. Providenti\u2019s request to increase the per share cash consideration.\nLater on March 30, 2023, Skadden sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Gibson\nDunn that provided, among other things, (i) that no divestiture of assets of Heska generating more than unspecified\namounts in revenues in each of the North American segment and in all other jurisdictions for fiscal year 2022 would\nbe required to obtain regulatory approvals\u037e (ii) for a termination fee of $45 million payable by the Company under\ncertain circumstances\u037e and (iii) for a reverse termination fee of $60 million payable by Acquiror if the Merger\nAgreement was terminated due to failure to obtain regulatory approvals but that removed the proposed commercial\narrangement remedy.\nOn March 31, 2023, the Heska Board held a special virtual meeting at which representatives of each of Heska\u2019s\nsenior management, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler and Gibson Dunn were present.

            "text": "Recommendation of Heska Board and Its Reasons for the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the Heska Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be\naware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition\nto, yours. The Heska Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and\nnegotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Proposal be approved by\nthe Heska stockholders. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger - Interests of Heska\u2019s Directors and Officers in the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 57.\nBy unanimous vote, the Heska Board, at a special meeting held on March 31, 2023 and after careful\nconsiderations at this and prior Heska Board meetings, among other things:\n\u2022\ndetermined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Heska and the Heska stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\napproved, authorized, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nresolved to recommend that the Heska stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe Heska Board unanimously recommends that Heska stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nIn evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, the Heska Board consulted with Heska\u2019s senior management, outside legal counsel and financial\nadvisors. The Heska Board determined that entering into the Merger Agreement with Mars was advisable, fair to and\nin the best interests of Heska and its stockholders. In arriving at this determination and in recommending that Heska\nstockholders vote their shares of Common Stock in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Heska Board\nconsidered a number of factors, including the following factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance) which\nthe Heska Board viewed as being generally positive or favorable in coming to its determination, approval and related\nrecommendation:\n\u2022\nThe fact that the all-cash Merger Consideration will provide Heska stockholders with immediate value, in\ncash, for their shares of Common Stock, while avoiding the long-term business risk of retaining their shares\nof Common Stock, and while also providing such stockholders with certainty of value for their shares of\nCommon Stock.\n36TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nThe Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement represented a premium of\napproximately 38% to Heska\u2019s 60-day volume weighted average price on March 31, 2023, the last trading\nday prior to the public announcement by Heska and Mars of the Merger Agreement, and a premium of\napproximately 23% to the closing price on March 31, 2023.\n\u2022\nThe benefits that Heska was able to obtain during its negotiations with Mars, including an increase in\nMars\u2019s offer price per share from the beginning of the process to the end of the negotiations. The Heska\nBoard believed that the Merger Consideration reflected in the Merger Agreement represented Mars\u2019s best\nand final offer, and that there was no assurance that a more favorable opportunity to sell Heska would arise\nlater or through any alternative transaction.\n\u2022\nThe Heska Board\u2019s understanding of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects\nof Heska, including Heska\u2019s prospects as an independent publicly traded entity and its standalone\noperating plan.\n\u2022\nThe timing of the Merger and the risk that if Heska did not accept Mars\u2019s offer, it may not have another\nopportunity to do so or to pursue an opportunity offering at least as much value to Mars\u2019s stockholders.\n\u2022\nThe oral opinions of each of BofA Securities and Piper Sandler, which were subsequently confirmed by the\ndelivery of written opinions, dated March 31, 2023, to the effect that, as of such date, and based on and\nsubject to various assumptions and limitations described in their respective opinions, the Merger\nConsideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock (other than holders of shares of Restricted\nStock, shares owned (or held in treasury) by Heska, shares owned by any of Heska\u2019s wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries, Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub (or any other subsidiary of Mars) or shares for which a holder\nproperly perfects its appraisal rights under the DGCL) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below under the heading \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202f\nOpinions of Financial Advisors to Heska.\u201d\n\u2022\nThe Heska Board considered the terms of the Merger Agreement related to Heska\u2019s ability to respond to\nunsolicited acquisition proposals and determined that third parties would be unlikely to be deterred from\nmaking a competing proposal by the provisions of the Merger Agreement, including because the Heska\nBoard may, under certain circumstances, furnish information or enter into discussions in connection with\nan acquisition proposal if necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties. In this regard, the Heska Board\nconsidered that:\n\u2022\nsubject to its compliance with the Merger Agreement and prior to the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement by the requisite Heska stockholders, the Heska Board may change its recommendation to\nHeska stockholders with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement if, among other things, it\ndetermines that such proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\nwhile the Merger Agreement contains the Termination Fee that Heska would be required to pay to\nAcquiror in certain circumstances, the Heska Board believed that the Termination Fee is reasonable in\nlight of such circumstances and the overall terms of the Merger Agreement, consistent with fees in\ncomparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers. For further discussion regarding the\ncircumstances in which Heska would be required to pay the Termination Fee, please see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fee\u201d beginning on page 82.\n\u2022\nThe Heska Board\u2019s belief that the Merger Agreement offered reasonable assurances as to the likelihood of\nconsummation of the Merger, including the likelihood that the Merger will receive all necessary regulatory\napprovals without unacceptable conditions and that all conditions to consummation of the Merger will be\nsatisfied. To that end, the Heska Board further considered the potential length of the regulatory approvals\nprocess and that the Merger Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it may not be\nterminated until April 1, 2024, which may be extended for two additional three-month periods to September\n30, 2024 under specified circumstances, together with the fact that Heska would be entitled to receive the\nReverse Termination Fee if the necessary regulatory approvals\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nhave not been obtained by such date and the Merger Agreement is terminated. The Heska Board also\nconsidered the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement and the fact that Mars was\nguaranteeing Acquiror\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nThe fact that the Merger will be subject to the approval of Heska stockholders.\n\u2022\nThe fact that the Merger does not require the approval of Mars\u2019s stockholders, with the attendant risks\nassociated with such a vote.\n\u2022\nThe support of the Merger by the Wilson Stockholders and the Sveen Stockholders, as evidenced by their\nexecution of the Voting Agreements.\n\u2022\nThe fact that Heska stockholders who do not vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and who follow certain\nprescribed procedures would be entitled to seek appraisal under Delaware law.\n\u2022\nThe fact that the Heska Board reviewed, in consultation with Heska\u2019s legal advisors, and considered that\nthe terms of the Merger Agreement, taken as a whole, including the parties\u2019 representations, warranties and\ncovenants and the circumstances under which the Merger Agreement may be terminated, in its belief, are\nreasonable. The Heska Board also reviewed and considered the limited number and nature of the\nconditions to the completion of the Merger, including customary regulatory approvals.\nThe Heska Board also considered and balanced against the potentially positive factors a number of\nuncertainties, risks and factors it deemed generally negative or unfavorable in making its determination, approval and\nrelated recommendation, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):\n\u2022\nThe fact that Heska stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of Heska and will not\nbenefit from any appreciation in value of Heska, including any appreciation in value that could be realized\nas a result of improvements to Heska\u2019s operations.\n\u2022\nThe diversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic\nopportunities while working to implement the Merger.\n\u2022\nThe fact that, while Heska had discussions with certain other potentially interested third party acquirors,\nneither Heska nor its financial advisors publicly solicited proposals from potential acquirers or conducted a\nfull market check immediately prior to signing the Merger Agreement as a means of determining whether\nthere were other parties interested in acquiring, or entering into another strategic transaction with, Heska.\n\u2022\nThe potential negative effect of the pendency of the transaction on Heska\u2019s business, including its\nrelationships with employees, customers and suppliers, and the restrictions on the conduct of Heska\u2019s\nbusiness prior to completion of the Merger.\n\u2022\nThe risk that the Merger may not be completed despite the parties\u2019 efforts or that completion of the Merger\nmay be unduly delayed, even if the requisite approval is obtained from Heska stockholders, including the\npossibility that conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to complete the Merger may not be satisfied\n(including the possibility that applicable regulatory approvals may not be obtained), and the potential\nresulting disruptions to Heska\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe fact that certain regulatory approvals are required to complete the Merger, and the risk that\ngovernmental authorities may seek to impose unfavorable terms or conditions on the required regulatory\napprovals or that those regulatory approvals may not be obtained at all.\n\u2022\nThe fact that, subject to certain limited exceptions, during the term of the Merger Agreement, Heska is\nprohibited from soliciting any inquiry or proposal with respect to a competing proposal for Heska.\n\u2022\nThe possibility that the Termination Fee payable by Heska upon the termination of the Merger Agreement\nunder certain circumstances could discourage other potential acquirers from making a competing\nacquisition proposal to acquire Heska.\n\u2022\nThe fact that the parties have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses\nin connection with the Merger, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nThe fact that Heska\u2019s directors and officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in\naddition to, those of Heska\u2019s stockholders generally, as detailed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger -\nInterests of Heska\u2019s Directors and Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 57.\n\u2022\nThe restrictions on the conduct of Heska\u2019s business during the period between the execution of the Merger\nAgreement and the consummation of the Merger, as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement - Conduct of Business Pending the Merger\u201d beginning on page 71.\n\u2022\nThe fact that the consideration received by Heska\u2019s U.S. stockholders in the Merger will generally be\ntaxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes as more fully described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger - \nU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d beginning on page 62.\n\u2022\nThe risks described under the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Heska\u2019s most recent filing on Form 10-K,\nand the matters described under the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation\u201d beginning on page 22 .\nThe Heska Board considered all of these factors as a whole, as well as others, and, on balance, concluded that\nthe potential benefits of the Merger to Heska stockholders outweighed the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and\npotentially negative factors associated with the Merger.\nThe foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Heska Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but is\nmeant to include material factors considered by the Heska Board. The Heska Board collectively reached the\nconclusion to approve the Merger Agreement in light of the various factors described above and other factors that\nthe members of the Heska Board believed were appropriate. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection\nwith its evaluation of the Merger, the Heska Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise\nassign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determinations and recommendations.\nMoreover, each member of the Heska Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and\nmay have given different weight to different factors. The Heska Board did not undertake to make any specific\ndetermination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its\nultimate determination. The Heska Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information available to it,\nincluding discussions with Heska\u2019s senior management and outside legal and financial advisors. It should be noted\nthat this explanation of the reasoning of the Heska Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-\nlooking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement\nRegarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d beginning on page 22. Accordingly, the Heska Board unanimously\nrecommends that Heska stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nCertain Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information",

In connection with the process leading to the execution of the Merger Agreement, Heska\nmanagement prepared certain unaudited projections of future financial and operating performance of Heska for the\nyears 2023 through 2027, which we refer to as the \u201cForecasted Financial Information.\u201d The Forecasted Financial\nInformation was provided by Heska management to the Heska Board and Heska\u2019s financial advisors for their use and\nreliance in connection with their respective financial analyses and opinions (see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger -\nOpinions of Financial Advisors to Heska\u201d beginning on page 41).\nThe inclusion of this Forecasted Financial Information should not be regarded as an indication that any of\nHeska, its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this Forecasted\nFinancial Information considered, or now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future performance or\nevents, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and such summary projections set forth below should\nnot be relied on as such.\nThe Forecasted Financial Information was prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects.\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the Forecasted Financial Information reflects numerous estimates and\nassumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of Heska\u2019s management. Further, given that\nthe Forecasted Financial Information covers multiple years, by its nature, it becomes subject to greater uncertainty\nwith each successive year beyond its preparation. The Forecasted Financial Information is subject to various risks,\nincluding, among others, the effect of future regulatory or legislative actions on Heska or\n39TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe industries in which it operates, the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the Merger on\nrelationships with customers, vendors, competitors, management and other employees, risks relating to Heska\u2019s\nindebtedness, changes in the general economic environment, or social or political conditions that could affect\nHeska\u2019s businesses, potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation, and other matters described in the\nsections entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information,\u201d and \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation.\u201d\nThe Forecasted Financial Information reflects both assumptions as to certain business decisions that are\nsubject to change and, in many respects, personal judgment, and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and\nperiodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments.

The Forecasted Financial Information does not take into account\nall of the possible financial and other effects of the Merger on Heska, the effect on Heska of any business or strategic\ndecision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed, or the\neffect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the Merger Agreement\nhad not been executed, but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the\nMerger. Further, the Forecasted Financial Information does not take into account the effect on Heska of any possible\nfailure of the Merger to occur.

Estimated financial data\nof the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant\ntransaction. Estimated financial data of Heska were based on Forecasted Financial Information. The overall low to\nhigh EV / LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected transactions were 16.0x to 30.0x (with a mean of\n19.1x and a median of 17.9x). The overall low to high EV / FY+1 Adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected\ntransactions were 11.5x to 21.6x (with a mean of 15.6x and a median of 15.1x). BofA Securities then applied a selected\nrange of EV / LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples derived from the selected transactions of 18.0x to 30.0x to the 2022A\nAdjusted EBITDA of Heska, as reflected in Heska\u2019s public filings, and applied a selected range of EV / FY+1\nAdjusted EBITDA multiples derived from the selected transactions of 15.0x to 22.0x to the 2024E estimated Adjusted\nEBITDA of Heska, as provided by Heska management and as reflected in Forecasted Financial Information.

BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Heska to\ncalculate the estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Heska was forecasted\nto generate during Heska\u2019s fiscal years 2023 through 2027 based on the Forecasted Financial Information. BofA\nSecurities calculated terminal values for Heska by applying a range of perpetuity growth rates of 3.5% to 4.5%, based\non input from Heska management, to Heska\u2019s fiscal year ending December 31, 2027 estimated unlevered, after-tax free\ncash flows. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 using\ndiscount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%, which were based on an estimate of Heska\u2019s weighted average cost of\ncapital. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Heska,\nrounded to the nearest $0.05 per share, as compared to the Merger Consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity \nValue Reference Range for Heska\nMerger Consideration\n$61.10 - $110.55\n$120.00\nOther Factors\nBofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities\u2019 material\nfinancial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other\nthings, the following:\n\u2022\nhistorical trading prices and trading volumes of Common Stock, which indicated low and high closing\nprices for Common Stock during the 52-week period ended March 30, 2023 of approximately $60.21 per\nshare and $147.57 per share, respectively\u037e\n\u2022\nstock price targets for Heska as reflected in selected publicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019\nreports, which indicated low and high stock price targets of $58.00 per share and $150.00 per share,\nrespectively, on an undiscounted basis and approximately $53.21 per share and $137.61 per share,\nrespectively, on a present value basis\u037e and\n\u2022\npremia paid in U.S. public company all-cash mergers and acquisitions transactions across all industries with\ntransaction values of over $1 billion announced between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2022 measured\nin relation to each target company\u2019s closing share price on the day prior to the announcement of the\napplicable transaction (or on the day prior to the unaffected date prior to the announcement of the\ntransaction, when applicable), which based on application of a premia reference range of 22% - 52% to the\nclosing price of Common Stock on March 30, 2023 of $97.35, indicated an implied per share equity value\nreference range for Heska ranging from $118.77 to $147.97.\nMiscellaneous\nAs noted above, the discussion set forth above is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by\nBofA Securities to the Heska Board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all\nanalyses undertaken by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a\ncomplex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of\nfinancial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial\nopinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its\nanalyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions\nof its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without\nconsidering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific\nanalysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater\nweight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic\nconditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Heska. The estimates of the future\nperformance of Heska in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or\nactual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by\nBofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities\u2019 analysis of the fairness,\nfrom a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration and were provided to the Heska\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to\nreflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may\ntrade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any\nparticular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be\nBofA Securities\u2019 view of the actual values of Heska.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between\nHeska and Mars, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Heska Board. The decision to enter\ninto the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Heska Board. As described above, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and\nanalyses were only one of many factors considered by the Heska Board in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and\nshould not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Heska Board or management with respect to the Merger or\nthe Merger Consideration.\nHeska has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee\ncurrently estimated to be approximately $9 million, $2 million of which was payable upon the delivery of its opinion\nand the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. Heska also has agreed to\nreimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify\nBofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,\nagents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in\nsecurities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal\ninvesting as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management,\nfinancing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,\ngovernments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates invest on a\nprincipal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance\npositions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments\n(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Heska, Mars and certain of their respective affiliates.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may\nprovide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Heska and certain of its affiliates\nand have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including having\nprovided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Heska and/or certain of its affiliates.\nFrom March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2023, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from\nHeska and certain of its affiliates of less than $1 million for investment and corporate banking services.\nIn addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future\nmay provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Mars and certain of its affiliates\nand have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having\nacted as financial advisor to Mars in connection with an acquisition transaction, (ii) having acted or acting as a\nbookrunner, arranger and syndication agent for, and/or as a lender under, certain term loans, letters of credit, credit\nand leasing facilities and other credit arrangements of Mars and/or certain of its affiliates, (iii) having provided or\nproviding certain derivatives, foreign exchange and other trading services to Mars and/or certain of its affiliates, and\n(iv) having provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Mars and/or certain of its\naffiliates. From March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2023, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues\nfrom Mars and certain of its affiliates of approximately $21 million for investment and corporate banking services.\nOpinion of Piper Sandler & Co.\nOn March 31, 2023, Piper Sandler rendered its oral opinion to the Heska Board, which was subsequently\nconfirmed in writing by delivery of Piper Sandler\u2019s written opinion, dated March 31, 2023, to the effect that, as of such\ndate, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the\nMerger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock.\nThe full text of Piper Sandler\u2019s written opinion dated March 31, 2023, which sets forth, among other things,\nthe assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of the\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreview undertaken by Piper Sandler in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement. Piper\nSandler\u2019s opinion addressed solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock, of\nthe Merger Consideration and does not address any other terms or agreements relating to the Merger or any other\nterms of the Merger Agreement. Piper Sandler\u2019s opinion was directed to the Heska Board in connection with its\nconsideration of the Merger and was not intended to be, and does not constitute, a recommendation to any Heska\nstockholder as to how such Heska stockholder should act or vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.\nPiper Sandler\u2019s opinion was approved for issuance by the Piper Sandler opinion committee.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Piper\nSandler, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed the financial terms contained in a copy of the Merger Agreement dated March 31,\n2023, labeled \u201cExecution Version\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed certain financial and other data with respect to Heska that was publicly available\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed certain information, including financial forecasts, relating to the business, earnings,\ncash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of Heska that were publicly available, as well as those that were\nfurnished to Piper Sandler by Heska (referred to in this proxy statement as the \u201cForecasted Financial\nInformation\u201d and summarized in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Certain Unaudited Forecasted Financial\nInformation\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nconducted discussions with members of senior management and representatives of Heska concerning the\ntwo immediately preceding matters, as well as Heska\u2019s business and prospects before and after giving\neffect to the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the current and historical reported prices and trading activity of shares of Common Stock and\nsimilar information for certain other companies deemed by Piper Sandler to be comparable to Heska\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial performance of Heska with that of certain other publicly traded companies that Piper\nSandler deemed relevant\u037e and\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination transactions\nthat Piper Sandler deemed relevant.\nIn addition, Piper Sandler conducted such other analyses, examinations and inquiries and considered such other\nfinancial, economic and market criteria as Piper Sandler deemed necessary in arriving at its opinion.\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Piper Sandler in connection with the\npreparation of its fairness opinion and reviewed with the Heska Board at a meeting of the Heska Board held on March\n31, 2023.\nThis summary includes information presented in tabular format, which tables must be read together with the text\nof each analysis summary and considered as a whole in order to fully understand the financial analyses presented by\nPiper Sandler. The tables alone do not constitute a complete summary of the financial analyses conducted by Piper\nSandler. The order in which these analyses are presented below, and the results of those analyses, should not be\ntaken as any indication of the relative importance or weight given to any of these analyses by Piper Sandler or the\nHeska Board. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on\nmarket data, is based on market data as it existed on or before March 30, 2023 and is not necessarily indicative of\ncurrent market conditions.\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, for purposes of the financial analyses described below, Piper Sandler\ncalculated enterprise value (\u201cEV\u201d\u037e defined as the relevant company\u2019s common equity value, plus, where applicable,\nbook value of preferred stock, plus fair value of contingent consideration, plus debt, plus capital and operating\nleases, less cash and cash equivalents, less investments in partnerships, and less short- and long-term investments\n(\u201cnet debt\u201d), plus, where applicable, book value of non-controlling interests), including (a) EV for each publicly\ntraded company included in the selected public companies analysis described below under the heading \u201cSelected\nPublic Companies Analysis\u201d (as well as Heska), based on (i) the market value of the relevant company\u2019s common\nequity, using closing stock prices on March 30, 2023 and (ii) the relevant company\u2019s net\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndebt as of such company\u2019s most recently reported quarter end, and (b) EV for each target company included in the\nselected M&A transactions analysis described below under the heading \u201cSelected M&A Transactions Analysis,\u201d\nbased on (i) the implied value of the relevant target company\u2019s common equity using the implied purchase price paid\nfor such target company\u2019s common equity in the relevant M&A transaction and the relevant target company\u2019s net\ndebt as of such target company\u2019s most recently reported quarter end immediately prior to announcement of the\nrelevant M&A transaction (in the case of M&A transactions involving the acquisition of public companies) or\notherwise (ii) the publicly announced EV for the target company at the time of announcement of the relevant M&A\ntransaction.

Diluted shares were calculated using the treasury stock\nmethod as of March 30, 2023 and in the case of Heska, included restricted stock units, in-the-money options, and\nshares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, including additional shares of Common Stock issuable as\na result of the make-whole provision with respect to the Convertible Notes.\nSelected Public Companies Analysis\nPiper Sandler reviewed, among other things, historical LTM financial information for Heska, as well as projected\nfinancial data prepared by Heska management for the years ending December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024 as\nincluded in the Forecasted Financial Information and compared such data to corresponding historical financial\ninformation and Consensus Estimates for the public companies that Piper Sandler considered to be U.S.-listed\ncompanies in each of animal health diagnostics / pharmaceuticals, animal heath distributors, and small- to mid-cap\n(market cap < $15 billion) (\u201cSmid Cap\u201d) product diagnostics. No company used in the selected public companies\nanalysis is identical to Heska and, as a result, the summary below and underlying financial analyses involve complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that\ncould affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which Heska was compared.\nPiper Sandler selected the following companies in the following categories:\n\u2022\nAnimal Health Diagnostics / Pharmaceuticals:\n\u2022\nMerck & Co., Inc.\n\u2022\nZoetis Inc.\n\u2022\nIDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\u2022\nElanco Animal Health, Inc.\n\u2022\nVirbac SA\n\u2022\nAnimal Health Distributors:\n\u2022\nAmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\u2022\nPatterson Companies, Inc.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nSmid-Cap Product Diagnostic Companies:\n\u2022\nbioM\u00e9rieux S.A.\n\u2022\nDiaSorin S.p.A.\n\u2022\nQuidelOrtho Corporation\n\u2022\nSD Biosensor, Inc.\n\u2022\nSeegene, Inc.\n\u2022\nOraSure Technologies, Inc.\nFor the selected public companies analysis, Piper Sandler calculated calendar year (\u201ccalendar year\u201d or \u201cCY\u201d),\nprojected 2023 and 2024 revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), LTM\nEBITDA margin, projected revenue growth, EV/revenue, EV/EBITDA, and stock price/earnings (based on the closing\nprice on March 30, 2023 and adjusted Consensus Estimates, respectively) multiples for each selected public company\nin each category. In the animal health diagnostics / pharmaceuticals and animal health distributors category, Piper\nSandler compared the EV/EBITDA multiples for the selected public companies to the corresponding multiple for\nHeska based on the closing price per share of Heska common stock on March 30, 2023 (the \u201cMarch 30th Closing\nPrice\u201d) and the Merger Consideration.

The free cash flows to the firm for each fiscal year and terminal year value were calculated from the\nForecasted Financial Information. Piper Sandler calculated the range of present values for free cash flows to the firm\nfor such periods based on a range of discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.0%, based on its estimation of Heska\u2019s\nweighted average cost of capital of 8.5%.\nThis analysis resulted in implied per share values for Common Stock ranging from $75.50 to $109.44 per share.\nPiper Sandler observed that the Merger Consideration was greater than the highest implied per share value derived\nfrom this analysis.\nOther Information\nPiper Sandler also noted for the Heska Board the following additional information that was not relied upon in\nrendering its opinion, but was provided for informational purposes.\n\u2022\nHistorical Trading Analysis. Piper Sandler reviewed the historical closing stock prices and trading volumes\nfor Common Stock over the 52-week period, which reflected low and high closing prices during such\nperiods ranging from $60.21 to $147.57 per share, respectively, as compared to the Merger Consideration of\n$120.00.\n\u2022\nPremiums Paid Analysis. Piper Sandler reviewed publicly available information for selected completed\nM&A transactions to determine the implied premiums paid in such M&A transactions over recent trading\nprices of the relevant target companies at certain dates prior to announcement of the relevant transaction\n(or prior to public reporting of market speculation with respect to relevant transaction if such reporting\noccurred prior to announcement). Piper Sandler selected M&A transactions announced since January 1,\n2015 involving those public target companies that Piper Sandler considered to be in (i) the animal health\nindustry and (ii) the medical technologies and life sciences tools and diagnostics industries with\ntransaction values between $250 million and $3.0 billion. Based on these criteria, Piper Sandler reviewed 14\ntransactions, and compared, among other things, the implied premiums paid in those selected M&A\ntransactions over certain time periods to the premium that would be paid to the holders of Common Stock\nbased on the Merger Consideration.\nThe analysis indicated the following premiums:\n \nSelected Transactions\n \nHeska(1)\nMean\nMedian\nPremium 1 day prior (to announcement of Merger)\n23.3%(2)\n34.2%\n29.8%\nPremium 1 week prior (to announcement of Merger)\n28.0%(3)\n36.1%\n30.9%\nPremium 1 month prior (to announcement of Merger)\n34.4%(4)\n38.7%\n39.9%\n \n(1)\nBased on the Merger Consideration of $120.00 per share.\n(2)\nBased on the March 30th Closing Price.\n(3)\nBased on the volume weighted average price per share of $93.75 one week prior.\n(4)\nBased on the volume weighted average price per share of $89.27 one month prior.\nMiscellaneous\nThe summary set forth above does not contain a complete description of the analyses performed by Piper\nSandler and reviewed with the Heska Board. The preparation of a fairness opinion is not necessarily susceptible to\npartial analysis or summary description. Piper Sandler believes that its analyses and the summary set forth above\nmust be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses or of the summary, without considering the\nanalyses as a whole or all of the factors included in its analyses, would create an incomplete view of the processes\nunderlying the analyses set forth in Piper Sandler\u2019s opinion. In arriving at its opinion, Piper Sandler considered the\nresults of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor analysis. Instead, Piper Sandler made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and financial\njudgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. In addition, the ranges of valuations resulting from any\nparticular analysis described above should not be taken to be Piper Sandler\u2019s view of the actual value of Heska.\nNone of the selected companies or transactions used in the analyses above is directly comparable to Heska or\nthe Merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the comparisons is not purely mathematical\u037e rather, it involves\nconsiderations and judgments concerning differences in historical and projected financial and operating\ncharacteristics of the selected companies and target businesses in the selected transactions and other factors that\ncould affect the public trading values of such companies or transaction values of such businesses.\nPiper Sandler performed its analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Heska Board. In performing its\nanalyses, Piper Sandler made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and\neconomic conditions and other matters. Certain of the analyses performed by Piper Sandler were based upon the\nForecasted Financial Information furnished to Piper Sandler by Heska management, which are not necessarily\nindicative of actual future results and may be significantly more or less favorable than actual future results. The\nForecasted Financial Information is inherently subject to uncertainty because, among other things, they are based\nupon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors. Piper Sandler does\nnot assume responsibility if future results are materially different from projected financial results.\nPiper Sandler\u2019s opinion was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Heska Board in making the\ndetermination to approve the Merger Agreement. While Piper Sandler provided advice to the Heska Board during\nHeska\u2019s negotiations with Acquiror and its parent, Mars, Piper Sandler did not recommend any specific amount or\ntype of consideration.\nPiper Sandler relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent verification,\nthe accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made\navailable, to Piper Sandler or discussed with or reviewed by Piper Sandler. Piper Sandler further relied upon the\nassurances of Heska management that the financial information provided was prepared on a reasonable basis in\naccordance with industry practice, and that Heska management was not aware of any information or facts that would\nmake any information provided to Piper Sandler incomplete or misleading. Without limiting the generality of the\nforegoing, for the purpose of its opinion, Piper Sandler assumed that with respect to the Forecasted Financial\nInformation, estimates and other forward-looking information reviewed by Piper Sandler, that such information was\nreasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Heska\nmanagement as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Heska. Piper Sandler expressed\nno opinion as to any such financial forecasts, estimates or forward-looking information or the assumptions on which\nthey were based. Piper Sandler relied, with consent of the Heska Board, on advice of the outside counsel and the\nindependent accountants to Heska, and on the assumptions of Heska management, as to all accounting, legal, tax\nand financial reporting matters with respect to Heska and the Merger Agreement.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Piper Sandler assumed that the executed Merger Agreement would be in all material\nrespects identical to the last draft of the Merger Agreement reviewed by Piper Sandler. Piper Sandler relied upon and\nassumed, without independent verification, that (i) the representations and warranties of all parties to the Merger\nAgreement and all other related documents and instruments that are referred to therein were true and correct, (ii) each\nparty to such agreements will fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed\nby such party, (iii) the Merger will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement without\namendments thereto and (iv) all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver by\nany party of any conditions or obligations thereunder. Additionally, Piper Sandler assumed that all the necessary\nregulatory approvals and consents required for the Merger will be obtained in a manner that will not adversely affect\nHeska or the contemplated benefits of the Merger.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Piper Sandler did not perform any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or\nliabilities (fixed, contingent or other) of Heska, and was not furnished or provided with any such appraisals or\nvaluations, nor did Piper Sandler evaluate the solvency of Heska under any state or federal law relating to\nbankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. The analyses performed by Piper Sandler in connection with its opinion\nwere going concern analyses. Piper Sandler expressed no opinion regarding the liquidation value of\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHeska or any other entity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Piper Sandler undertook no independent\nanalysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent\nliabilities, to which Heska or any of its affiliates is a party or may be subject, and at the direction of Heska and with its\nconsent, Piper Sandler\u2019s opinion made no assumption concerning, and therefore did not consider, the possible\nassertion of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters. Piper Sandler also assumed that neither\nHeska nor Acquiror was party to any material pending transaction, including without limitation any financing,\nrecapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the Merger.\nPiper Sandler\u2019s opinion was necessarily based upon the information available to it and facts and circumstances\nas they existed and were subject to evaluation on the date of its opinion. Events occurring after the date of Piper\nSandler\u2019s opinion could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing its opinion. Piper Sandler expressed no\nopinion as to the price at which Common Stock may trade following announcement of the Merger or at any future\ntime. Piper Sandler did not undertake to reaffirm or revise its opinion or otherwise comment upon any events\noccurring after the date of its opinion and does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nPiper Sandler\u2019s opinion addressed solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common\nStock of the Merger Consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement and did not address any other terms or\nagreement relating to the Merger or any other terms of the Merger Agreement. Piper Sandler was not requested to\nopine as to, and its opinion does not address, the basic business decision to proceed with or effect the Merger, the\nmerits of the Merger relative to any alternative transaction or business strategy that may be available to Heska,\nAcquiror\u2019s ability to fund the Merger Consideration (taking into account the guaranty from its parent, Mars), any\nother terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the fairness of the Merger to any other class of securities,\ncreditor or other constituency of Heska. Furthermore, Piper Sandler expressed no opinion with respect to the amount\nor nature of compensation to any officer, director or employee of any party to the Merger, or any class of such\npersons, relative to the compensation to be received by the holders of Common Stock in the Merger or with respect\nto the fairness of any such compensation.\nInformation about Piper Sandler\nAs a part of its investment banking business, Piper Sandler is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses\nin the animal health, medical diagnostics and other industries and their securities in connection with mergers and\nacquisitions, underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes. The Heska Board selected Piper Sandler to be its financial advisor and\nrender its fairness opinion in connection with the Merger on the basis of such experience and its familiarity with\nHeska.\nPiper Sandler acted as financial advisor to Heska in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee, currently\nestimated to be approximately $9 million, from Heska, which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger,\nexcept for $2.0 million of such fee which was payable to Piper Sandler upon the rendering its fairness opinion and was\ncreditable against the total fee. The opinion fee was not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger or the\nconclusions reached in Piper Sandler\u2019s opinion. Heska has also agreed to indemnify Piper Sandler against certain\nliabilities and reimburse Piper Sandler for certain expenses in connection with its services. Piper Sandler may, in the\nfuture, provide financial advisory and financing services to Heska and its affiliates and may receive fees for the\nrendering of such services. In addition, in the ordinary course of its business, Piper Sandler and its affiliates may\nactively trade securities of Heska and Mars or entities that are affiliated with Mars, for its own account or the account\nof its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. Piper Sandler may\nalso, in the future, provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Heska, Mars or entities that are\naffiliated with Heska or Mars, for which Piper Sandler would expect to receive compensation.\nConsistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, Piper Sandler has adopted policies and procedures\nto establish and maintain the independence of Piper Sandler\u2019s research department and personnel. As a result, Piper\nSandler\u2019s research analysts may hold opinions, make statements or recommendations and/or publish research reports\nwith respect to Heska, Mars, the Merger and other participants in the Merger that differ from the opinions of Piper\nSandler\u2019s investment banking personnel.\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSince January 1, 2020, independent of Piper Sandler acting as financial advisor to Heska in connection with the\nMerger, Piper Sandler received fees of approximately $5.2 million in the aggregate for acting (i) as financial advisor in\nconnection with the acquisition of scil animal care company GmbH in April 2020 (receiving fees of approximately $1.0\nmillion) and (ii) as underwriter in connection with Heska\u2019s follow-on offering of common stock in March 2021\n(receiving fees of approximately $4.2 million). Since January 1, 2020, Piper Sandler had not received any revenue in\nrespect of any financial advisory or financing services provided to Mars.\nTreatment of Convertible Notes",

Under the terms of the MIP and the Merger Agreement,\nin the event of a \u201cchange in control\u201d of Heska (as defined in the MIP and which the Merger will constitute), each\nparticipant will receive a pro-rated MIP target bonus, payable within 60 days of the change in control.\nThe Merger will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d under the MIP. Assuming the Effective Time occurs on July 1,\n2023, the approximate value of the pro-rated MIP target bonuses that would be payable to Heska\u2019s executive officers\nis as follows: Kevin S. Wilson - $495,890, Catherine I. Grassman - $99,178, Steven M. Eyl - $92,979, Eleanor F. Baker -\n$92,979, Christopher D. Sveen - $90,500, Anthony Providenti - $92,979 and Nancy Wisnewski - $92,979.\nDeal Bonuses\nIn recognition of their individual efforts in connection with the Merger, and subject to their respective\ncontinuous employment with Heska or a subsidiary through the 60th day following the Effective Time (or, if earlier,\nupon the termination of employment without cause), certain of the executive officers will receive supplemental cash\nbonuses as follows: Catherine I. Grassman - $158,000, Steven M. Eyl - $111,000, Eleanor F. Baker - $150,000,\nChristopher D. Sveen - $147,500, and Anthony Providenti - $150,000.\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEmployment Agreements\nHeska has entered into employment agreements with each of its executive officers (the \u201cEmployment\nAgreements\u201d). Each Employment Agreement provides for enhanced severance benefits in the event the executive\nofficer is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d or resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each as defined in each Employment Agreement)\nduring the period beginning three months prior to a \u201cchange of control\u201d of Heska (as defined in each Employment\nAgreement) and ending 18 months following a change of control (or, for Mr. Wilson, 24 months following a change of\ncontrol) (such termination, a \u201cCOC Termination\u201d). In the event of a COC Termination:\n\u2022\nMr. Wilson would receive (i) a lump sum severance payment equal to 2.99x the sum of his base salary and\nhis target bonus for the year of termination and (ii) Heska-paid COBRA premiums for up to 36 months\u037e and\n\u2022\nEach other executive officer would receive (i) severance equal to 12 months of his base salary, payable in\ninstallments and (ii) Heska-paid COBRA premiums for up to 12 months.\nIn addition, if Ms. Baker elects to relocate back to the United States in connection with a COC Termination,\nHeska will pay or reimburse her reasonable relocation expenses. The Employment Agreements also subject each of\nthe executive officers to non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants in the event of a COC\nTermination ranging from six months to 12 months following termination of employment (or, for Mr. Wilson, 36\nmonths following a COC Termination or a termination as a result of death or disability following a change of control).\nIf any of the severance benefits under the Employment Agreements constitute \u201cparachute payments\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 280G of the Code and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the\n\u201cExcise Tax\u201d), then the severance benefits will either be (i) provided in full or (ii) provided to such lesser extent that\nwould result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts,\nwhen taking into account applicable federal, state, local, and foreign income and employment taxes, the Excise Tax,\nand any other applicable taxes, results in the receipt by the executive officer, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest\namount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be subject to the Excise Tax.\nThe Merger will constitute a \u201cchange of control\u201d under the Employment Agreements. For the quantification of\nthe estimated value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Heska\u2019s\nnamed executive officers, see the table below titled \u201cNamed Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation.\u201d\nAgreements with Acquiror Following the Merger",

This\nsummary is based on the Code, the U.S. Treasury Department regulations issued under the Code, which we refer to as\nthe \u201cTreasury Regulations,\u201d and administrative rulings and court decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy\nstatement, all of which are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could\naffect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein.\nThis summary is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the \u201cIRS,\u201d or a court, and\nthere can be no assurance that the tax consequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or\nthat they would be sustained by a court if so challenged. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no\nopinion of counsel has been or will be rendered, as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Common Stock that is for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes (i) a citizen or an individual who is a resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation\n(or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of\nthe United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is includible in\ngross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if (A) a court within the\nUnited States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S.\npersons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (B) the trust has a valid election in effect\nunder applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n62TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThis summary is not a complete description of all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the\nMerger and, in particular, may not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of Common\nStock who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law including, for example, partnerships (or\nan entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and partners therein,\n\u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d or \u201cpassive foreign investment companies,\u201d financial institutions, dealers in\nsecurities, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities (including private foundations), mutual funds, real estate\ninvestment trusts, personal holding companies, regulated investment companies, securities or currency dealers,\ntraders in securities who elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting, non-U.S. holders, tax-exempt\ninvestors, S corporations, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-deferred or other retirement\naccounts, U.S. expatriates, former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired Common\nStock pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock option or right or otherwise as compensation, and holders who\nhold Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, or other integrated\ninvestment. Also, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to a holder of\nCommon Stock who exercises appraisal rights under DGCL. In addition, no information is provided with respect to the\ntax consequences of the Merger under any U.S. federal law other than income tax laws (including, for example the\nU.S. federal estate, gift, Medicare, and alternative minimum tax laws), or any state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws that may\nbe applicable to a holder. This summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than the\nMerger.\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Common Stock,\nthe tax treatment of a partner in such a partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership. Any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nthat holds Common Stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax\nconsequences of the Merger to them in their specific circumstances.\nThe tax consequences of the Merger will depend on a holder\u2019s specific situation. Holders of Common Stock\nshould consult their tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the Merger relevant to their particular\ncircumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or\nother tax laws and of changes in those laws.\nTax Consequences to U.S. holders\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will\ngenerally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, a U.S. holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will\nrecognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in\nthe Merger and (ii) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Common Stock exchanged therefor.\nIf a U.S. holder acquired shares of Common Stock by purchasing them, the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its\nshares will generally equal the amount the U.S. holder paid for the relevant shares. If a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in\nthe shares of Common Stock surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year as of the date of the Merger, the gain\nor loss will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including\nindividuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is\nsubject to certain limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Common Stock at different times or different\nprices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each\nblock of Common Stock.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of cash to a U.S. holder of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may, under certain circumstances,\nbe subject to information reporting and backup withholding, unless the holder provides proof of an applicable\nexemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification number, and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of\nthe backup withholding rules. Certain holders (such as corporations) are exempt from backup withholding.\nTo avoid backup withholding, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should return a\nproperly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 included with the letter of transmittal, certifying that such holder is a\nUnited States person, that the taxpayer identification number provided in the IRS Form W-9 is correct, and that such\nholder is not subject to backup withholding.\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be\nrefunded or credited against a holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the\nrequired information to the IRS in a timely manner.\nThe discussion set forth above is included for general information purposes only and is not a complete\nanalysis or discussion of all potential tax consequences relevant to holders of Common Stock. Holders of\nCommon Stock are strongly urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of the Merger\nin their particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any\nstate, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes in those laws.\nLitigation Related to the Merger",

favorable to\nHeska than the confidentiality agreement between Heska and Mars, information with respect to Heska to\nthe party making such Company Takeover Proposal\u037e provided, that, to the extent permitted by law, Heska\nmust concurrently provide to Acquiror any such information that is non-public\u037e and\n\u2022\nengage in discussions or negotiations with such party regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, a \u201cCompany Superior Proposal\u201d means a bona fide, unsolicited written Company\nTakeover Proposal (i) that if consummated would result in a third party (or the stockholders of such third party)\nacquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Common Stock or more than 50% of the assets of\nHeska and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) that the Heska Board determines in good faith (in accordance\nwith the Merger Agreement), after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking\ninto account the timing and likelihood of consummation relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, and after giving effect to any changes to the Merger Agreement proposed by Acquiror in response to\nsuch Company Takeover Proposal (in accordance with the Merger Agreement) and all other financial, legal,\nregulatory, tax and other aspects of such Company takeover proposal, including all conditions contained therein and\nthe person making such Company Takeover Proposal, as the Heska Board deems relevant, is more favorable from a\nfinancial standpoint to Heska stockholders than the Merger.\nNotice of Company Takeover Proposal\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Heska must (i) as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24\nhours after receipt) advise Acquiror of the receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal or a request for information\nrelating to Heska that constitutes or contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the\n74\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nidentity of the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and a description of the material terms and\nconditions thereof and (ii) keep Acquiror reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis as to the status of the\nCompany Takeover Proposal including any developments, discussions or negotiations and a description of any\nchanges to the material terms and conditions in respect thereof.\nThe Company Recommendation\u037e Adverse Recommendation Change\u037e Fiduciary Exception\nAs described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Heska Board has unanimously made the\nrecommendation that Heska stockholders vote \u201c FOR \u201d the proposal to approve the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, the Merger,\nwhich unanimous recommendation we refer to as the \u201cCompany Recommendation.\u201d The Merger Agreement provides\nthat the Heska Board will not affect an \u201cAdverse Recommendation Change\u201d (as described below) except as defined\nbelow.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, generally, the Heska Board may not: (i) (A) fail to include the Company\nRecommendation in this proxy statement\u037e (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly\npropose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the Company\nRecommendation\u037e or (C) adopt, approve or recommend to Heska stockholders, or resolve to or publicly propose or\nannounce its intention to adopt, approve or recommend to Heska stockholders, a Company Takeover Proposal (any\naction described in (i) being referred to as an \u201cAdverse Recommendation Change\u201d) or (ii) authorize, cause or permit\nHeska or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement\n(including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or\nagreement in principle with respect to any such Company Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement\nentered into in accordance with the Merger Agreement).\nThe Heska Board may, prior to receipt of Company Stockholder Approval (but not after):\n\u2022\nwith respect to a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of the\nnon-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause\nHeska to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to substantially concurrently with such termination\nenter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company Takeover Proposal if and only if, prior to taking\neither such action, (i) Heska has complied with its obligations under the non-solicitation provision of the\nMerger Agreement (including the notice obligations to Acquiror described below), (ii) the Heska Board has\ndetermined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,\nthat the Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (iii) the Heska Board\ndetermines in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel)\nthat the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under\napplicable law\u037e and\n\u2022\nmake an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a \u201cCompany Intervening Event\u201d which is\ndefined as any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition or combination\nthereof (other than (x) the fact that Heska meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts,\nestimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period, any\nchanges after the date of the Merger Agreement in the market price or trading volume of Common Stock\n(provided that the underlying causes of such fact, to the extent not otherwise excluded from this definition\nof \u201cCompany Intervening Event,\u201d may be taken into account in determining the existence of a Company\nIntervening Event), or (y) any reasonably foreseeable consequence of the announcement of the Merger\nAgreement) that was not known to or reasonably expected by the Heska Board as of or prior to the date of\nthe Merger Agreement and is unrelated to any Company Takeover Proposal or expected receipt of a\nCompany Takeover Proposal, which we refer to as an \u201cIntervening Event Recommendation Change,\u201d if (i)\nHeska has complied with its obligations under the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement\n(including the notice obligations to Acquiror described below) and (ii) the Heska Board has determined, in\ngood faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure\nto take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under\napplicable law.\nPrior to making any such Adverse Recommendation Change, effecting any such termination or making any such\nIntervening Event Recommendation Change, (i) Heska must give Acquiror at least five business days\u2019 prior notice of\nits intention to do so, the reasons therefor, and certain information related thereto, (ii) Heska must\n75\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnegotiate in good faith with Acquiror and its representatives to enable Acquiror to propose revisions to the terms of\nthe Merger Agreement, and (iii) the Heska Board must consider in good faith any revisions to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement proposed in writing by Acquiror (and not revoked) and determine in good faith after consultation with its\noutside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, either that the Company Takeover Proposal continues to\nconstitute a Company Takeover Proposal if the revisions proposed by Acquiror were to be given effect, or that the\nfailure to make an Intervening Event Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with\nthe Heska Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under applicable law, as the case may be. Further, in the event of any change to\nthe financial terms or other material terms of such Company Takeover Proposal, Heska must give a new notice to\nAcquiror consistent with that described in clause (i) above and a new notice period under clause (iii) above will\ncommence, except that the five business day notice period will instead be the longer of three business days and the\nperiod remaining under the original notice period immediately prior to the delivery of such additional notice. Heska is\nnot permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement under these provisions with respect to a Company Superior\nProposal unless Heska pays Acquiror the Termination Fee (which is described in more detail in the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 82) prior to or concurrently with such termination.\nAccess to Information\nSubject to certain exceptions and limitations, Heska will, and will cause its subsidiaries to (i) afford Acquiror and\nits representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to Heska\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 personnel,\nproperties, contracts, commitments, books and records (including tax returns), (ii) make available to Acquiror such\nother available information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Acquiror may reasonably request\nand will instruct Heska\u2019s (and its subsidiaries\u2019) independent accountants to provide access to their work papers and\nsuch other information (including tax returns and drafts of any U.S. federal income tax returns or other material state\nor non-U.S. income tax returns) as Acquiror may reasonably request, and (iii) reasonably cooperate with Acquiror,\nand use commercially reasonable efforts to, no later than 10 days after the date of the Merger Agreement, provide all\ninformation required under Sec. 20 of the German real estate transfer tax act to Acquiror, in order to ensure that\nAcquiror can meet its obligation to file timely notifications for German real estate transfer tax purposes in compliance\nwith applicable laws, each of (i), (ii) and (iii) other than with respect to any person or information if so doing, in\nHeska\u2019s and its outside counsel\u2019s reasonable judgment, would violate any law or contract or jeopardize the attorney-\nclient privilege\u037e provided, that Heska informs Acquiror of the general nature of such information and reasonably\ncooperates with Acquiror to share the information in such a manner that would not result in the violation of law or\ncontract or loss or waiver of such privilege. Any access or investigation must be conducted so as not to interfere\nunreasonably with the business and operations of Heska or any of its subsidiaries.\nNo investigation by Acquiror or its representatives will affect or be deemed to modify or waive the\nrepresentations and warranties of Heska set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nIndemnification, Exculpation and Insurance\nAll rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the\nEffective Time, and any rights to advancement of expenses in favor of the Company Indemnified Parties, as provided\nin the organizational documents of Heska or its subsidiaries existing as of March 31, 2023 or any indemnification\nagreements existing as of March 31, 2023 will survive the Merger and may not be amended, repealed or otherwise\nmodified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights\nthereunder of the Company Indemnified Parties with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective\nTime. From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror will ensure the Surviving Corporation honors these obligations.\nPrior to the Effective Time, at Heska\u2019s option, Heska will, or, if Heska is unable to, Acquiror will cause the\nSurviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancelable extension of the directors\u2019 and\nofficers\u2019 liability coverage of Heska\u2019s existing directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies and Heska\u2019s existing fiduciary\nliability insurance policies, in each case with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time\nand for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to\nany claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or\nbetter credit rating as Heska\u2019s current insurance carrier with respect to such insurance with terms, conditions,\nretentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nunder Heska\u2019s existing policies as in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement\u037e provided that Heska (or the\nSurviving Corporation) will not pay an amount for such new insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium\ncurrently paid by Heska for such insurance. If such \u201ctail\u201d prepaid policy has been obtained by either Heska or the\nSurviving Corporation prior to or as of the Effective Time, Acquiror will cause such policy to be maintained in full\nforce and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation. If\nsuch a \u201ctail\u201d policy cannot be obtained as of the Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation is required to\nmaintain in effect, for a period of not less than six years, Heska\u2019s current directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 fiduciary liability\ninsurance policies or a comparable policy, subject to certain limitations and minimum standards.\nEfforts to Complete the Merger\u037e Regulatory Approvals\nThe Merger Agreement provides that Heska, Acquiror and Merger Sub will each use their respective reasonable\nbest efforts to:\n\u2022\npromptly submit all notifications to and obtain all clearances, authorizations, consents, orders and\napprovals of all governmental entities that may be, or become necessary for execution and delivery of, and\nthe performance of obligations pursuant to, the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\ncooperate fully in promptly submitting all notifications and seeking to obtain all such clearances,\nauthorizations, consents, orders and approvals\u037e and\n\u2022\nprovide any other information any governmental entity may reasonably request in connection with the\nMerger Agreement (including requests for additional information or materials under the HSR Act) as\npromptly as reasonably practicable.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, each party is required to (i) promptly, and in no event later than April 14, 2023\n(unless otherwise mutually agreed to), make its respective filings pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) as promptly as\npracticable, make its respective filings and notifications, if any, under any other applicable antitrust, competition,\nforeign investment or trade regulation law, and, in each case, to supply to the appropriate governmental entities as\npromptly as practicable any additional information and documentary materials as may be requested.\nAcquiror and Heska (if requested by Acquiror) have agreed to take all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate any\nimpediment under any antitrust, competition, foreign investment or trade regulation law that may be asserted by any\nantitrust or competition governmental entity, so as to enable the parties to close the Merger as promptly as\npracticable, including (subject to the next paragraph):\n\u2022\nproposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of its\nassets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nentering into such other arrangements as are necessary or advisable to avoid the entry of, or to have\nvacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, that would prevent\nthe consummation of the Merger\u037e and\n\u2022\ncontesting and defending on the merits any claim asserted by a governmental entity in order to avoid the\nentry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would prevent the Closing.\nUnder the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until\nrequired information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and statutory waiting period\nrequirements have been satisfied. On April 14, 2023, both Heska and Acquiror filed their respective Notification and\nReport Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. The waiting period under the HSR Act is expected to expire on\nMay 15, 2023 unless earlier terminated or extended by the issuance of a Second Request to the parties by the FTC or\nthe Antitrust Division prior to that time. If the FTC or the Antitrust Division issues a Second Request, the waiting\nperiod with respect to the Merger will be extended for an additional period of 30 calendar days following both parties\u2019\nsubstantial compliance with that request unless earlier terminated by the FTC or the Antitrust Division. After that\ntime, the waiting period may be extended only by court order or with\n77\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe consent of the parties. At any time before or after the consummation of any such transactions, the FTC or the\nAntitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust laws of the United States as it deems necessary or\ndesirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the Merger.\nAcquiror and Heska have agreed that Acquiror will control and direct the parties\u2019 filings (including filing timing),\nstrategies, process, negotiation of settlements (if any) and related proceedings to obtain regulatory approvals (and\nAcquiror shall consult with and consider in good faith Heska\u2019s views with regard thereto), and that Acquiror may\ntake or pursue any reasonable actions or strategies to avoid, resist or reduce the scope of any action sought or\nrequired by governmental entities or pertaining to the submission of all required notices to any governmental entity\nand obtaining the consent therefrom, so long as such action or strategy will not delay satisfaction of the closing\nconditions past the \u201cOutside Date\u201d as it may be extended to the \u201cExtended Outside Date\u201d or \u201cFurther Extended\nOutside Date,\u201d as applicable (as such terms are defined in the section entitled \u201cSummary - Termination of the Merger\nAgreement\u201d beginning on page 8).\nHowever, none of Mars, Acquiror, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Mars will be required to, and Heska\nand its subsidiaries will not without the prior written consent of Mars, take any action, or commit to take any action,\nor agree to any condition or limitation contemplated in the antitrust covenant of the Merger Agreement (i) that is not\nconditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, (ii) with respect to any of Mars\u2019s, Acquiror\u2019s or their respective\nsubsidiaries operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, contracts, licenses, relationships, contractual rights or\nobligations, customers or assets or (iii) that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, the sale,\ndivestiture or disposition of assets, properties or businesses of Heska or any of its subsidiaries and/or the\ntermination of any business (in any jurisdictions(s)) of Heska or any of its subsidiaries that (x) generated more than\n$30,000,000 of annual consolidated revenues of Heska and its subsidiaries in the North America segment (as defined\nin Heska\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2022) during the 12-month period ending as\nof December 31, 2022 or (y) generated more than $30,000,000 of annual consolidated revenues of Heska and its\nsubsidiaries in the International segment (as defined in Heska\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2022) during the 12-month period ending as of December 31, 2022 (each of (i), (ii) or (iii), a \u201cBurdensome\nCondition\u201d).\nMars, Heska and their respective subsidiaries (including Acquiror and Merger Sub) have agreed not to, prior to\nthe Closing, acquire any businesses or securities of a third party if such acquisition would, or would reasonably be\nexpected to, prevent or materially delay the obtaining of necessary regulatory approvals.\nEmployee Matters\nFor a period of at least 12 months following the Effective Time, Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall, (i)\nprovide each employee of Heska or any of its subsidiaries who continues as of the Effective Time to be employed by\nAcquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate (which we refer to herein as \u201ccontinuing employees\u201d) with at least\nthe same level of base salary or hourly wage rate and target cash bonus opportunity, in each case, that was provided\nto such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide the continuing employees employee\nbenefits (excluding equity, compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation, defined benefit pension, post-\nemployment health and welfare benefit plans and change in control, retention or other non-recurring compensation)\nthat are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such continuing employees by Heska and\nany of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) provide each continuing employee who is\nterminated without cause with severance benefits and payments as specified in the Company Disclosure Schedules.\nAt the Effective Time, each continuing employee shall be given service credit for all purposes, including for\neligibility to participate, benefit levels and eligibility for

subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Closing, provided that the foregoing shall not result in the\nduplication of benefits and shall not be recognized with respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension\nplan or for any purpose under any long-term incentive plan or post-employment welfare benefit plan.\nAfter the Effective Time, Acquiror will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause each continuing employee to\nbe immediately eligible to participate in all Acquiror Benefit Plans to the extent coverage under such benefit plans\nreplaces coverage under a comparable benefit plan of Heska in which such continuing employee participated\nimmediately before the Effective Time and (ii) for purposes of each Acquiror Benefit Plan providing\n78\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmedical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any continuing employee and his or her covered\ndependents, (A) cause all pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods and actively at work\nrequirements of such Acquiror Benefit Plan to be waived to the extent such limitations, exclusions, waiting periods\nand actively at work requirements were waived or

continuing employee becomes eligible to participate in such Acquiror\u2019s benefit plan to be taken into\naccount under such Acquiror Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and\nmaximum out of pocket requirements for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance\nwith such benefit plan of Heska.\nUnless otherwise directed by Acquiror prior to the Closing, Heska shall take all actions necessary to terminate\nthe Company\u2019s tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) retirement plan (which we refer to herein as the \u201cHeska 401(k)\nPlan\u201d), effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing, and contingent upon the occurrence\nof the Merger, and provide that participants in the Heska 401(k) Plan shall become fully vested in any unvested\nportion of their accounts as of the date such plan is terminated. If the Heska 401(k) Plan is terminated, Acquiror shall\ndesignate a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement that is sponsored\nby Acquiror or one of its subsidiaries that will cover eligible continuing employees effective as of, or as soon as\nadministratively practicable but no later than 90 days following, the Closing.\nAs soon as practicable upon or following, and in all events within 60 days following the closing of the Merger,\nAcquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall pay each continuing employee eligible to participate in the MIP or any\nother annual cash incentive compensation plan a payment equal to such continuing employee\u2019s pro rata target bonus\namount under the MIP or other annual cash incentive compensation plan for the period between January 1, 2023 and\nthe Closing.\nCompany Special Meeting\nHeska has agreed to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of Heska stockholders for the purpose of\nvoting upon the Merger Proposal as promptly as practicable following resolution of any SEC comments with respect\nto this proxy statement (which Heska was required to use its reasonable best efforts to file by May 1, 2023). Subject\nto certain exceptions permitting a delay, Heska must hold a meeting of Heska stockholders for the purpose of voting\non the Merger Proposal on or around the 20th business day following the commencement of the mailing of this proxy\nstatement to Heska stockholders.\nTreatment of Convertible Notes\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, Heska has agreed to take all actions required by the Convertible Notes\nIndenture, between Heska and U.S. Bank, National Association, with respect to the Convertible Notes or that are\notherwise reasonably requested by Acquiror pursuant to and in compliance with the Convertible Notes Indenture, in\nconnection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, including by giving any notices that may be required by the Convertible Notes Indenture or reasonably\nrequested by Acquiror and delivering to the trustee, noteholders or other applicable persons any documents or\ninstruments required by the Convertible Notes Indenture or reasonably requested by Acquiror to be delivered at or\nprior to the Effective Time to such trustee, noteholders or other applicable persons. Heska has agreed not to elect any\nsettlement method pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture that would be applicable to conversions whose\nsettlement will occur after the Effective Time without Acquiror\u2019s consent.\nCertain Additional Covenants\nThe Merger Agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the\nfiling of this proxy statement, covenants relating to regulatory filings and approvals (which are described in the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) -Regulatory Approvals\u201d beginning on page 64), reporting requirements\nunder Section 16 of the Exchange Act, certain takeover matters, coordination with respect to litigation relating to the\nMerger, public announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and\nnotification regarding certain matters.\n79\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nConditions to Consummation of the Merger",

Because the vote on the Advisory Compensation Proposal is\nadvisory only, it will not be binding on Heska, Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is\napproved and the Merger is completed, the Merger-related compensation will be payable to Heska\u2019s named executive\nofficers, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the approval of the Advisory\nCompensation Proposal.\nRequired Vote of Stockholders\nThe Heska Board unanimously recommends that Heska stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Advisory Compensation\nProposal. Under the Bylaws, if a quorum is present, approval of the Advisory Compensation Proposal requires the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the\nSpecial Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, for stockholders of record who are not present in person\nor represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and for beneficial owners who fail to instruct their bank, broker, trust\nor other nominee to vote on any proposal, a failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the Advisory\nCompensation Proposal.

        "APPRAISAL RIGHTS": {
            "text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS\nIf the Merger is consummated, a holder of Common Stock who does not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal\nand who properly demands appraisal of its shares of Common Stock, who does not effectively withdraw its demand\nor waive or lose the right to appraisal, and who otherwise complies with the requirements for perfecting and\npreserving appraisal rights, will be entitled to seek appraisal of his, her or its shares in connection with the Merger\nunder Section 262.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL\nand is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E.\nThe following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that\na holder of Common Stock exercise its appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of\nCommon Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having\na beneficial interest in shares of Common Stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker,\ntrust or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly\nand in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through a bank, broker,\ntrust or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker, trust\nor the other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, a holder of shares of Common Stock who (1) does not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal\u037e\n(2) continuously is the record holder of such shares from the date of the making of the demand through the effective\ndate of the Merger\u037e and (3) otherwise follows the procedures set forth in Section 262, may be entitled to have its\nshares of Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of the shares of Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid, if any, on the amount determined to be fair value, as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Common Stock as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may be more than, the same as, or less than the per share consideration of the\nstockholders are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption and approval at a meeting of\nstockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled\nto appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy\nstatement constitutes notice to holders of Common Stock that appraisal rights are available in connection with the\nMerger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E. In connection with the\nMerger, any holder of shares of Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve\nsuch holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully and consult with legal advisors. Failure to strictly\ncomply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights\nunder the DGCL. A holder of Common Stock who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the\nMerger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures\nfor exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Common Stock, the Company encourages a stockholder\nconsidering exercising such rights to seek the advice of legal counsel.\nA stockholder wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of its shares of Common Stock must do ALL of\nthe following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Heska a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger\nProposal at the Special Meeting and be a stockholder of record at the time of the making of such demand\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Common Stock from the date of making the demand\nthrough the effective date of the Merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers\nthe shares before the effective date of the Merger)\u037e and\n89TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\na stockholder of record, a beneficial owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly demanded\nappraisal or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares of Common Stock within 120 days after the effective date of the\nMerger. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition and has no intention of\ndoing so. Accordingly, it is the stockholder\u2019s obligation to initiate all necessary action to perfect his, her or\nits appraisal rights in respect of his, her or its shares of Common Stock within the time prescribed in Section\n262.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger\nProposal, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against or abstain\nfrom voting on the Merger Proposal or not vote their shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Heska, before the\nvote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting at which the Merger Proposal will be submitted to the\nstockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares of Common Stock. A holder of shares of\nCommon Stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal\nis made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the Merger. A proxy that is\nsubmitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal,\nand it will result in the stockholder\u2019s loss of appraisal rights and will nullify any previously delivered written demand\nfor appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit\na proxy containing instructions to vote against or abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal. Neither voting against\nthe Merger Proposal nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal will, in and of itself,\nconstitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal\nmust be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make\nthe written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting will result in a loss\nof appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares\nregistered in that holder\u2019s name on the date the written demand is made. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares\nof Common Stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform Heska of\nthe identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares of\nCommon Stock in connection with the Merger. If the shares of Common Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary\ncapacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record\nowner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,\nthe demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized\nagent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the\nagent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is\nacting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nA STOCKHOLDER WHO HOLDS ITS SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS, TRUST OR OTHER\nNOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH ITS\nBANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE\nPROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR\nAPPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD\nIN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT\nPROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE\nSTEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nA record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of Common Stock as a\nnominee for others may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with respect to shares of Common Stock held for one\nor more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand\nshould state the number of shares of Common Stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of\nCommon Stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares\n90\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof Common Stock held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds shares of Common Stock through a\nbroker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand\nfor appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the\ndepository nominee as record owner.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nHeska Corporation\n3760 Rocky Mountain Avenue\nLoveland, Colorado 80538\nAttn: Corporate Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days of the effective date of the Merger, any holder of shares of Common Stock who has\ndemanded appraisal but has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may\nwithdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement\nby delivering to Heska a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the\ndemand made more than 60 days after the effective date of the Merger will require written approval of the Surviving\nCorporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems just. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal\nwhen that approval is required or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal\nproceeding, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value of his, her or its shares of Common\nStock determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value may be more than, the same as, or less than the\nMerger Consideration.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective date of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will\nnotify each holder of shares of Common Stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262,\nand who has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date\nthereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation, a beneficial\nowner of shares as to which the record holder has duly demanded appraisal or any record holder of shares of\nCommon Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may\ncommence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the\nSurviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of\nthe shares of Common Stock held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no\nobligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving\nCorporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Common\nStock. Accordingly, any holder of shares of Common Stock who desires to have its shares appraised should initiate\nall necessary action to perfect its appraisal rights in respect of its shares of Common Stock within the time and in the\nmanner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Common Stock to file such a petition within the period\nspecified in Section 262 could nullify the holder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any holder of shares of Common Stock who has complied\nwith the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon request given in writing, to receive from\nthe Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the\nadoption and approval of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which Heska has received demands for appraisal,\nand the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must give this statement to the\nrequesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the request for such a statement or within 10 days after the\nexpiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of\nCommon Stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own\nname, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted\nabove, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\n91\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Common Stock and a copy thereof is served\nupon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to\nfile with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders\nwho have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not\nbeen reached. After notice to the stockholders who have demanded appraisal and the Surviving Corporation, if such\nnotice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a\nhearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become\nentitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded\npayment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the\npendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court\nof Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. In addition, because the Common Stock is publicly\nlisted on the NASDAQ (and we do not expect this to change prior to the Merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of shares of Common Stock who are otherwise entitled to\nappraisal rights unless (x) the total number of such shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding\nshares of Common Stock or (y) the value of consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares\nexceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\nappraise the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any\nrules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndetermine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the Common Stock as of the effective date of the Merger after taking into account all\nrelevant factors exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,\ntogether with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. When the fair value has\nbeen determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued\nduring the pendency of the proceeding, if the Delaware Court of Chancery so determines, by the Surviving\nCorporation to the stockholders entitled to receive the same, upon surrender by those stockholders of the\nCertificates representing their shares of Common Stock or, in the case of holders of uncertificated shares of Common\nStock, forthwith. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the\neffective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will\naccrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during\nthe period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the\nentry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided in the preceding sentence only\nupon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of shares as determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which\nare generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts\nthat could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather\napplies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,\nthe Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d\nA stockholder considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of its shares of Common Stock\nas so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as, or less than the\n92\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconsideration it would receive pursuant to the Merger if it did not seek appraisal of its shares and that an opinion of\nan investment banking firm as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration payable in a\nMerger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Heska\nbelieves that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair\nvalue as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal\ncould result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither\nHeska nor Mars anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal\nrights, and each of Heska and Mars reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of\nSection 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Common Stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for\nappraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do\nnot include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances.\nEach stockholder seeking appraisal is responsible for his, her or its attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness expenses,\nalthough, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of\nthe expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to\nbe appraised.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Common Stock under Section 262 fails to\nperfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of Common\nStock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective date of the Merger into the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder\u2019s right to appraisal if,\namong other things, no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger or if the\nstockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an\nacceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262 within 60 days of the effective date of the\nMerger or thereafter with the written approval of Heska.\nFrom and after the effective date of the Merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be\nentitled to vote such shares of Common Stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other\ndistributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of Common Stock, if any,\npayable to stockholders as of a time prior to the effective date of the Merger. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or\nif the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an\nacceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with the written\napproval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition\nfor appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as\nto any stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval\nof the court. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a\nstockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. In view of the complexity of Section 262, any stockholder wishing to exercise\nappraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights. To the extent there\nare any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262, Section 262 will govern.\n93\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2024 ANNUAL MEETING",
