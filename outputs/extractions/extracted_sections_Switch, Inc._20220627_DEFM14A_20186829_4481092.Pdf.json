            "text": "The Special Meeting (page 33)\nThe Proposals\nThe special meeting of our stockholders (the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d) will be held on August 4, 2022, at 11:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at The Citadel Campus, 1\nSuperloop Circle, McCarran, Nevada 89434. At the Special Meeting, holders of our shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share\n(\u201cClass A common stock\u201d) and Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share (\u201cClass B common stock,\u201d and together with the Class A common\nstock, the \u201ccommon stock\u201d), as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 15, 2022 (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d), will be asked to consider\nand vote on (1) a proposal to approve the Merger, (2) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid\nor become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Mergers, and (3) a proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special\nMeeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.\nPursuant to our bylaws and in accordance with Nevada law, only the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting may be brought before the\nSpecial Meeting.\nAs part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, we may determine that the Special Meeting be held solely by means of remote\ncommunication rather than in person. If we take this step, we will announce the decision to do so in advance and provide details on how to\nparticipate in the meeting, via a press release issued by Switch and made available on our website, www.switch.com. We will also file the press\nrelease with the SEC as definitive additional solicitation material. Holders of shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d who desire to attend the\nmeeting are encouraged to contact their brokers and other nominees for instructions on how they may attend.\nRecord Date, Notice and Quorum\nAll holders of record of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of the Record Date, which was the close of business on June 15,\n2022, are entitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the Special Meeting. Each\nstockholder will be entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the Special Meeting for each share of Class A common stock and each\nshare of Class B common stock that such holder owned as of the Record Date. On the Record Date, there were 150,767,439 shares of Class A\ncommon stock and 94,131,279 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.\nThe presence in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy of our holders of\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to be cast at the Special Meeting, each voting separately, will constitute a quorum for\npurposes of the Special Meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the Special Meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present\nfor the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, we expect that the Special Meeting will\nbe adjourned to a later date. Pursuant to our bylaws, if a quorum is not present, the stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, present in\nperson, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy, will have the power to\n3Table of Contents\nadjourn the meeting without notice other than announcement at the meeting. The Special Meeting may also be adjourned for the purpose of\nsoliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.\nRequired Vote\nCompletion of the Mergers requires approval of the Merger by the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of shares of Class A common stock\nand Class B common stock entitled to be cast on the matter, each voting separately. Each stockholder is entitled to cast one vote on each matter\npresented at the Special Meeting for each share of Class A common stock and each share of Class B common stock owned by such stockholder on\nthe Record Date. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our holders of common stock are entitled to cast rather\nthan on the number of votes cast, if you fail to vote by proxy or in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote\ncommunication, virtually (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting\nagainst the proposal to approve the Merger.\nThe approval of the proposal regarding the non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Mergers, and the approval of the proposal regarding any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the\npurpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger, each requires the affirmative\nvote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the Mergers. For the purpose\nof each of these proposals, if you fail to vote by proxy or in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote\ncommunication, virtually, or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals, assuming a\nquorum is otherwise present at the Special Meeting. Abstentions, while present for purposes of determining presence of a quorum, are not\nconsidered votes cast and therefore will have no other effect on the outcome of these proposals.\nAs of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 4,641,945 shares of Class A\ncommon stock and 24,766,143 shares of Class B common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 3.1% of the voting power of Class A\ncommon stock, 26.3% of the voting power of Class B common stock and 12.0% of the voting power of our common stock entitled to vote at the\nSpecial Meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the common stock that they own in favor of the\nproposal to approve the Merger, in favor of the proposal regarding the non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be paid or become\npayable to our named executive officers in connection with the Mergers and in favor of the proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special\nMeeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.\nProxies\u037e Revocation\nAny of our stockholders of record entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its common stock by returning the enclosed proxy card,\nauthorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or by appearing and voting at the Special Meeting in person, or, in\nthe event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually. If the shares of common stock that you own are held in\n\u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, you should instruct your broker on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your broker.\nAny proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by voting again over the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on\nAugust 3, 2022, signing and returning another proxy card with a later date,\n4\nTable of Contents\nprovided we receive the updated proxy card before the date of the Special Meeting, or voting in person at the Special Meeting, or, in the event that\nthe Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually. Attendance alone will not be sufficient to revoke a previously authorized\nproxy.\nThe Mergers (page 39)",

Both the Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report Forms\nwith the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on May 25, 2022. Following discussions between the Company and Parent and the DOJ, Parent\nwithdrew its Notification and Report Form effective June 24, 2022.

The withdrawal and refiling are standard procedural steps that provide the DOJ with additional time to complete its review of the proposed\nMerger. Assuming Parent refiles its Notification and Report Form on June 28, 2022, the new waiting period will expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on\nJuly 28, 2022, unless the FTC or the DOJ earlier terminates the waiting period or issues requests for additional information and documentary material\nrelated to the Merger (\u201cSecond Requests\u201d).

Complying with Second Requests can take a significant period of time. The Company continues to\nanticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the second half of 2022, assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the Mergers. In\naddition, the Company and Parent made the appropriate applications with the Federal Communications Commission on May 27, 2022, notifications\nwith each of the Georgia Public Service Commission and Nevada Public Utilities Commission on May 26, 2022 and notifications to the Nevada\nGaming Commission and Michigan Control Gaming Control Board on May 20, 2022.

The O\u2019Dell Action, Bushansky Action, and Brown Action name as defendants the Company and our board of directors, and\nallege, among other things, that the preliminary Proxy Statement misstates or fails to disclose certain material information in violation of federal\nsecurities laws.

Unless extended\nby mutual agreement, the Merger Agreement provides that either party may terminate the agreement if the Merger has not been consummated on or\nprior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date six months after the date the Merger Agreement was signed (subject\n18Table of Contents\nto certain limitations and available extensions and remedies). For further information regarding the timing of the closing of the Mergers, see \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement \u2014 Effective Times\u037e Closing Date.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Mergers are not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Mergers are not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any\npayment for their shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, Switch will remain a public company, and our shares\nof Class A common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed on the NYSE. Upon a termination of the Merger\nAgreement, under certain circumstances and pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we will be required to pay Parent the company\ntermination fee. In certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay us the parent termination fee upon termination of the Merger\nAgreement. For further information regarding the circumstances giving rise to payment of these termination fees, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2014\nTermination Fees.\u201d\nQ:\nWill Switch continue to pursue its conversion to a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) now that this merger has been announced?\nA:\nYes. Between signing and closing the Mergers, we have agreed not to cause Switch to be treated as a REIT without Parent\u2019s consent, but until the\nMergers are consummated, we will continue to pursue and prepare for conversion to a REIT as previously announced by Switch and described in\nSwitch\u2019s 2022 annual meeting proxy statement.\nQ:\nIf the Mergers are completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares of common stock?\nA:\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, your shares of Class A common stock and Company Ltd. Common Units will automatically be converted\ninto the right to receive your portion of the merger consideration. Shortly after the Mergers are completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal\ndescribing how you may exchange your shares of Class A common stock and/or Company Ltd. Common Units, as applicable, for the merger\nconsideration. If your shares of common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from\nyour broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for\nthe merger consideration.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Special Meeting will be held on August 4, 2022, at 11:00 a.m., Pacific time, at The Citadel Campus, 1 Superloop Circle, McCarran, Nevada 89434.\nAs part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, we may determine that the Special Meeting be held solely by means of remote\ncommunication rather than in person. If we take this step, we will announce the decision to do so in advance and provide details on how to\nparticipate in the Special Meeting via a press release issued by Switch and made available on our website, www.switch.com.\nQ:\nWho can vote and attend the Special Meeting?\nA:\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the Record Date, which was the close of business on June 15, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of\nand attend and vote at the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the Special Meeting. Each stockholder will be entitled to cast\none vote on each matter presented at the Special Meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the Record Date.\n19\nTable of Contents\nAs part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, we may determine that the Special Meeting be held solely by means of remote\ncommunication rather than in person. If we take this step, we will announce the decision to do so in advance and provide details on how to attend\nand participate at the meeting via a press release issued by Switch and made available on our website, www.switch.com.\nQ:\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve the Merger?\nA:\nApproval of the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock\nentitled to be cast on the matter, each voting separately. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our\nstockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to\nyour broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to\nour named executive officers in connection with the Mergers?\nA:\nApproval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in\nconnection with the Mergers requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure\nto vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have no effect on the\nproposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve adjournments of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of any adjournment of the Special Meeting to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve\nthe Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure to vote your shares\n(including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have no effect on the proposal. The\nCompany does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the proposal to approve the Merger is approved at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhy is my vote important?\nA:\nIf you do not authorize your proxy or voting instructions or vote in person at the Special Meeting, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held\nby means of remote communication, virtually, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the Special Meeting. In addition,\nbecause the proposal to approve the Merger must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of shares of Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock entitled to be cast on the matter, each voting separately, your failure to authorize your proxy or voting instructions\nor to vote in person at the Special Meeting, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, will have\nthe same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the approval of the Merger.\nQ:\nHow does the merger consideration compare to the market price of Switch\u2019s common stock?\nA:\nThe merger consideration of $34.25 per share represents a premium over the closing price of our shares of Class A common stock of $30.75 per\nshare on May 10, 2022, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nHow does our board of directors and special committee recommend that I vote?\nA:\nOur board of directors and the special committee recommend that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the Merger, \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to\napprove, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may\n20\nTable of Contents\nbe paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Mergers, and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve any adjournment\nof the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat is the special committee?\nA:\nIn connection with its consideration of the matters described in this proxy statement, our board of directors established the special committee. The\nspecial committee, as currently constituted, is composed of Bryan Wolf, Liane Pelletier, Kim Sheehy and Jason Genrich, none of whom is party to\nthe TRA or affiliated with TRA beneficiaries, and each of whom is independent of management. The special committee was established for the\npurpose of considering, investigating, evaluating, analyzing, negotiating and making recommendations to our board of directors in connection with\nany potential strategic transactions and the TRA. For more information on the actions and determinations of our board of directors and the special\ncommittee in connection with their consideration of the Merger Agreement and the Mergers, please see the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Mergers\u2014Background of the Mergers.\u201d\nAfter considering various factors described in this proxy statement under the caption, \u201cThe Mergers\u2014Recommendation of the Board of Directors\nand the Special Committee\u201d and \u201c \u2014Reasons for the Mergers,\u201d the special committee and our board of directors have each: (1) determined that the\nMerger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Mergers, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,\nare fair to, and in the best interests of, Switch and its stockholders\u037e and (2) approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement. The special committee also recommended that our board of directors approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Mergers.\nQ:\nWhat is the TRA and the TRA Amendment?\nA:\nConcurrent with the initial public offering of shares of its Class A common stock, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as\nof October 5, 2017, by and among the Company, Company Ltd. and the members of Company Ltd. party thereto. The TRA provided for payment by\nthe Company to members of Company Ltd. party to the TRA and their assignees of approximately 85% of the amount of the calculated tax savings,\nif any, the Company will realize due to (i) increases in tax basis resulting from the redemption of Company Ltd. Common Units and (ii) certain other\ntax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA. Amendment of the TRA requires the approval of members of Company Ltd. satisfying\nthe Supermajority Threshold.\nAs a result of negotiation by the special committee, concurrent with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, Company Ltd. and\nmembers of Company Ltd. satisfying the Supermajority Threshold executed the TRA Amendment. The TRA Amendment establishes that in\nexchange for the termination of the TRA and all rights associated therewith, the parties to the TRA (other than the Company) will be entitled to\nreceive a payment in cash from the Company of $0.37 per Company Ltd. Common Unit (such implied price equating to $5.89 per share of Class A\ncommon stock if there were no reduction in the amount of aggregate accelerated change of control payments required to be made under the then-\ncurrent terms of the TRA) in connection with the closing of the Mergers in full satisfaction of the payment obligations to the TRA beneficiaries\nunder the TRA. Such payments will be made by the Company as promptly as practicable following the earlier of (i) the closing of the Mergers (or\nany other change of control of the Company (as defined in the TRA)), or (ii) December 31, 2022. This represents a reduction of approximately $1,121\nmillion, which is an approximately 93.72% reduction of the estimated aggregate amount of approximately $1,196 million that would have otherwise\nbeen payable to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA in respect of a change of control of the Company at the implied price per share of Class A\ncommon stock offered by Parent, absent the TRA Amendment. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe\nMergers\u2014Amendment to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\n21\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nDo any of Switch\u2019s directors and executive officers have any interest in the Mergers that is different than mine?\nA:\nOur directors and executive officers have certain interests in the Mergers that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders\ngenerally, including accelerated vesting of outstanding Switch equity awards, potential severance benefits, benefits under the TRA Amendment,\nthe Land Purchase Agreement and the Rollover Agreements and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage. See \u201cThe Mergers \u2014\nInterests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers\u201d for additional information about interests that our directors and\nexecutive officers have in the Mergers that are different than yours.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the annexes attached to this proxy statement, please\nvote your shares of common stock or authorize a proxy to vote your shares of common stock in one of the ways described below as soon as\npossible. You will be entitled to one vote for each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock that you owned as of the Record\nDate.\nQ:\nHow do I cast my vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record on the Record Date, you may vote at the Special Meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your shares at the Special\nMeeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed,\npostage-paid envelope, or, if you prefer, by following the instructions on your proxy card for telephonic or Internet proxy authorization. If the\ntelephone or Internet option is available to you, we strongly encourage you to use it because it is faster and less costly. Registered stockholders\ncan transmit their voting instructions by telephone by calling 1-866-697-7125 or on the Internet at www.proxypush.com/SWCH. Telephone and\nInternet proxy authorization are available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day immediately prior to the Special Meeting.

To authorize your proxy by mail, please complete\nsign, date and mail your proxy card in the envelope provided. If you attend the Special Meeting, you may request a ballot when you arrive.\nQ:\nHow do I cast my vote if my shares of common stock are held of record in \u201cstreet name\u201d?\nA:\nIf you own shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you must provide voting instructions in\naccordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, since brokers, banks and\nother nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement. If you have not\nreceived such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee,\nwho can give you directions on how to vote your common stock. If you hold your shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee\nand wish to vote in person at the Special Meeting, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually,\nyou must obtain a \u201clegal proxy,\u201d executed in your favor, from the broker, bank or other nominee (which may take several days).\nQ:\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?\nA:\nWith respect to the proposal to approve the Merger, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote in person, or, in the event that the Special\nMeeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy or if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give voting\ninstructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to the proposal regarding the non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Mergers and the proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the purpose of\nsoliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast\nyour vote in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy or if you hold your\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such\nproposals, assuming a quorum is otherwise present at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nHow will proxy holders vote my common stock?\nA:\nIf you properly authorize a proxy prior to the Special Meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct. If you properly authorize a\nproxy but no direction is otherwise made, your shares of common stock will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the Merger, \u201cFOR\u201d the\nproposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in\nconnection with the Mergers, and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional\nproxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger. Pursuant to our bylaws and consistent with applicable law,\nonly the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting may be brought before the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Class A common stock before the Special Meeting?\nA:\nIf you held shares of Class A common stock on the Record Date but transfer them prior to the Effective Time, you will retain your right to vote at\nthe Special Meeting, but not the right to receive the merger consideration for those shares. The right to receive such consideration when the\nMerger becomes effective will pass to the person who at that time owns the shares of Class A common stock you previously owned.\nQ:\nCan I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?\nA:\nYes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the Record Date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it is\nexercised by voting again over the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on August 3, 2022, signing and returning another proxy\ncard with a later date, provided we receive the updated proxy card before the date of the Special Meeting, or voting in person at the Special\nMeeting, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually. Attendance at the meeting will not, in itself,\nconstitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you have instructed a broker to vote your shares, the foregoing options for changing\nyour vote do not apply and instead you must follow the applicable instructions received from such broker to change your vote.\nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?\nA:\nIf you are a U.S. holder (as defined in \u201cThe Mergers \u2014 Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\u201d on page 76 of this proxy statement), the\nexchange of your shares of our common stock for merger consideration (including any amounts required to be withheld for tax purposes) pursuant\nto the Merger will generally require you to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount of merger consideration you receive pursuant to the Merger (including any amounts required to be withheld for tax purposes)\nand your adjusted tax basis in such surrendered shares. A non-U.S. holder (as defined in \u201cThe Mergers \u2014 Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences\u201d on page 76 of this proxy statement) will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of such\nnon-U.S. holder\u2019s shares of our common stock for merger consideration in the Merger unless such non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the\nUnited States or we are, or were during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation.

            "text": "Voting of Shares\nYou may vote by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person, or you may vote by submitting a proxy. The method of voting by proxy differs (1)\ndepending on whether you are viewing this proxy statement on the Internet or receiving a paper copy and (2) for shares held as a record holder and\nshares held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d If you hold your shares of common stock as a record holder and you are viewing this proxy statement on the Internet, you\nmay vote by submitting a proxy over the Internet by following the instructions on the website referred to in the Notice previously mailed to you. If you\nhold your shares of common stock as a record holder and you are reviewing a paper copy of this proxy statement, you may vote your shares by\ncompleting, dating and signing the proxy card that was included with the proxy statement and promptly returning it in the preaddressed, postage paid\nenvelope provided to you, or by submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the proxy card.\nStockholders who wish to attend the Special Meeting will be required to present verification of ownership of our common stock, such as a bank or\nbrokerage firm account statement, and will be required to present a valid government-issued picture identification, such as a driver\u2019s license or passport,\nto gain admittance to the Special Meeting. No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in\nthe Special Meeting.\nIf you hold your shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you will receive a\nNotice from your broker, bank or other nominee that includes instructions on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or nominee will allow you to\ndeliver your voting\n35Table of Contents\ninstructions over the Internet and may also permit you to vote by telephone. In addition, you may request paper copies of the proxy statement and proxy\ncard from your broker by following the instructions on the Notice provided by your broker.\nUnder NYSE rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. A\nbroker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker, trust or other\nnominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular\nproposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if you own shares of common stock through a broker,\nbank or other nominee (i.e., in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card\nthat your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect\nto any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of\ncommon stock following the directions contained in such voting instruction card. If you have not received such voting instructions or require further\ninformation regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares of\ncommon stock. If you hold your shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and wish to vote in person at the Special Meeting, or,\nin the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, you must obtain a \u201clegal proxy,\u201d executed in your favor, from\nthe broker, bank or other nominee (which may take several days). Because the proposal to approve the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to be cast on the matter, each voting separately, the failure to\nprovide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve the\nMerger. Because the approval of each of (1) the non-binding, advisory proposal regarding compensation and (2) the proposal to adjourn the Special\nMeeting if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal, and because your bank, broker, trust or\nother nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with\nvoting instructions will have no effect on approval of either proposal, assuming a quorum is otherwise present.\nIf you vote through the Internet, you should be aware that you may incur costs to access the Internet, such as usage charges from telephone companies\nor Internet service providers and that these costs must be borne by you. If you vote by Internet or telephone, then you need not return a written proxy\ncard by mail.\nYOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Regardless of whether you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your shares\nof common stock as described above as promptly as possible. If you properly give your proxy and submit it to us in time to vote, one of the individuals\nnamed as your proxy will vote your shares as described below.\nAll shares entitled to vote and represented by properly submitted proxies (including those submitted electronically, telephonically and in writing)\nreceived before the polls are closed at the Special Meeting, and not revoked or superseded, will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the\ninstructions indicated on those proxies. If no direction is indicated on a proxy, your shares will be voted as follows: \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger, as described in\nthe proxy statement, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal, and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of this meeting, if needed, to allow the Company to get\nmore votes. The proxy gives each of Rob Roy, Thomas Morton and Gabe Nacht discretionary authority to vote your shares in accordance with his best\njudgment with respect to all additional matters that might come before the Special Meeting.",

            "text": "Background of the Mergers\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement and the related ancillary agreements were the result of extensive negotiations between Switch, DigitalBridge and IFM\n(on behalf of funds managed or advised by each of DigitalBridge and IFM) and their respective affiliates. The following is a brief description of the\nbackground of the Mergers and related transactions.\nSwitch\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cboard of directors\u201d or the \u201cboard\u201d), together with members of senior management of Switch, regularly reviews and\nassesses the performance, future growth prospects, business plans and overall strategic direction of Switch, and considers a variety of strategic\nalternatives that may be available to Switch, including continuing to pursue its strategy as a standalone company or pursuing potential strategic or\nfinancing transactions with third parties, in each case, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. As part of that review, in August 2021, the board\nannounced the establishment of a REIT committee of the board to evaluate whether a REIT conversion would enhance Switch\u2019s long-term value creation\nstrategy. After REIT committee and management consideration, Switch announced in its third quarter 2021 earnings release, and on an earnings\nconference call on November 5, 2021, adjusted full year 2021 guidance and that the board unanimously determined to pursue a REIT conversion, targeting\na REIT tax election for the 2023 tax year. Switch Class A common stock closed on November 5, 2021 at $23.06 per share.\nFollowing discussions among the board and management during the second half of 2021, including regarding several publicly traded data center\ncompanies that announced sale transactions, and consistent with the board\u2019s and management\u2019s efforts to maximize stockholder value, the board\nauthorized management to take preliminary steps to gather information to explore potential strategic transactions (a \u201cStrategic Transaction\u201d). Thereafter,\n(i) on November 24, 2021, representatives of Switch met with representatives of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d) and (ii) on December 16,\n2021, representatives of Switch met with representatives of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d), in each case, to discuss the market and\nstrategic alternatives.\nDuring meetings of the board held on December 9, 2021, attended by management, and on December 16, 2021, attended by management and\nrepresentatives from Latham & Watkins LLP (\u201cLatham\u201d), outside legal counsel, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the board considered and discussed\ninitiating a process to evaluate strategic alternatives. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley presented to the board regarding certain strategic alternatives\nthat could be available to Switch and potential counterparties that could be interested in a Strategic Transaction. Mr. Roy, CEO and founder of Switch,\nnoted that he had no current plans, nor had he taken any actions, to participate with any bidder in a Strategic Transaction, but wanted to preserve\nflexibility if the board determined to engage in a Strategic Transaction and a potential financial buyer wanted Mr. Roy to have a continuing management\nrole in the surviving entity and/or rollover all or a portion of his Switch equity. Taking this and other considerations into account, the board formed a\nspecial committee of the board (the \u201cspecial committee\u201d) for the purpose of considering, evaluating, negotiating and making recommendations to the\nboard for or against any Strategic Transaction. The special committee would comprise of directors who were determined to be (i) independent, (ii) not\ncurrent employees of Switch, and (iii) otherwise disinterested in a potential Strategic Transaction. The initial members of the special committee were Don\nSnyder, Jason Genrich, Kim Sheehy and Bryan Wolf. Mr. Snyder served as the initial chair of the special committee.\n39Table of Contents\nFollowing the December 16, 2021 board meeting, the special committee instructed the board of directors to authorize negotiation of terms of engagement\nwith each of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors to the special committee in connection with exploring strategic alternatives and\nauthorized Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to reach out to an agreed list of potential bidders on a confidential basis. Goldman Sachs and Morgan\nStanley were selected, in part, because of (i) their familiarity with Switch, (ii) their reputation as internationally recognized investment banking firms and\n(iii) their substantial experience in transactions similar to the Mergers. The special committee also determined that based on fee allocations, only Goldman\nSachs would be asked to provide a fairness opinion in connection with a Strategic Transaction. Switch Class A common stock closed on December 16,\n2021 at $26.94 per share. Throughout December of 2021 and January of 2022, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley contacted 16 potential bidders,\nincluding each of DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A and Bidder B, on or about January 11, 2022, to inquire about their interest in entering into a Strategic\nTransaction with Switch.\nOn January 6, 2022, the special committee and representatives from Latham, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and management met, and Goldman Sachs\nand Morgan Stanley presented to the special committee regarding certain Strategic Transactions that could be considered.\nOn January 13 and January 19, 2022, the special committee held additional meetings attended by representatives from Latham, Goldman Sachs, Morgan\nStanley and management. During these meetings, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley presented to the special committee regarding their outreach and\ncommunication with potential counterparties.\nDuring the January 13, 2022 special committee meeting, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reviewed with the special committee Switch\u2019s Tax Receivable\nAgreement (the \u201cTRA\u201d). The TRA was entered into in connection with the restructuring undertaken as part of Switch\u2019s initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in\n2017 and contractually commits Switch to pay members of Switch, Ltd. (other than Switch) as of immediately prior to the IPO, 85% of the tax benefits\nrealized by Switch as the result of the members of Switch, Ltd. exchanging their common units in Switch, Ltd. for Class A common stock in Switch after\nthe IPO process (the remaining 15% would inure to the benefit of Switch). The special committee, together with its outside advisors and management,\nconsidered Switch\u2019s recorded liability of $359 million as of September 30, 2021 with respect to tax benefit payments owed to TRA members, and that the\nTRA required an early termination payment to TRA members upon a change in control, taking into account certain valuation assumptions and the\ndiscounted present value of all tax benefit payments payable to the members under the TRA. The special committee and its advisors discussed the size of\nthis early termination payment liability and the various terms, assumptions and calculations set forth in the TRA in determining the early termination\npayment. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley presented on various actions taken by other public companies with tax receivable agreements that\nincluded early termination payments upon a change in control, including payment in full of the early termination payment, and amendments and waivers\nthat modified the size or terms of the early termination payment. In addition, the special committee considered that the net present value of the TRA tax\nbenefits to Switch after a REIT conversion was potentially lower. The special committee, in consultation with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,\nreviewed the magnitude of the early termination payment and potential ambiguity in the TRA with respect to determining the early termination payment\nunder various change in control scenarios and considered the potential for this ambiguity to be disruptive to the transaction process and confuse\nbidders or cause bidders to potentially reduce the value they would be willing to pay in a transaction. The special committee, in consultation with\nGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, further considered that terminating the TRA or having a fixed, certain value of payments under the TRA in\nconnection with a change in control would be in the best interests of Switch and its stockholders. The special committee and its advisors determined to\nconduct further analysis regarding the ability to amend or modify the TRA pursuant to its terms in connection with a change in control, and separately\nrequested that management conduct its own analysis and report back to the special committee. The special committee acknowledged certain members of\nthe special committee, board, and management were entitled to payments under the TRA and considered appropriate procedures to address any conflict\nof interest as a result.\nOver the next month, Latham negotiated and Switch entered into nondisclosure agreements with nine potential bidders, including (i) DigitalBridge on\nFebruary 8, 2022, (ii) IFM on February 9, 2022, (iii) Bidder A\n40\nTable of Contents\non February 4, 2022 and (iv) Bidder B on February 3, 2022. Two additional bidders executed nondisclosure agreements in March of 2022. All 11 of the\nnondisclosure agreements included a customary standstill provision\n(which did not prohibit the bidders from privately requesting waivers of such provisions). Upon the execution of a nondisclosure agreement, each of the\n11 bidders received access to a virtual data room enabling them to conduct due diligence regarding Switch. In addition, each of the nine potential bidders\nwho executed a nondisclosure agreement in February 2022 attended separate in-person management presentations with Switch during the first several\nweeks of February 2022.\nAdditional board meetings were held on February 2, 2022 and February 4, 2022 with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and\nmanagement. During these board meetings, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley updated the board regarding their discussions to date with potential\nbidders for a Strategic Transaction and management reviewed with the board bidder presentation materials and prospects and the Switch Projections,\nincluding the material assumptions therein. For a detailed discussion regarding the Switch Projections, please see \u201c\u2014Certain Unaudited Financial\nProjections\u201d beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement.\nThe special committee held a meeting on February 9, 2022 with Latham in attendance to further discuss the TRA in connection with a potential Strategic\nTransaction and special committee composition. Prior to the meeting, Mr. Snyder, the sole member of the special committee who was also a TRA member,\nelected to recuse himself from the meeting and offered to withdraw from the committee so that no special committee member had any interest in the TRA.\nThe special committee then discussed the TRA, including the calculation of the early termination payment at various stock prices and the number of TRA\nmembers required to amend the TRA. Following discussion, the special committee recommended to the board that management (i) propose to certain TRA\nmembers holding the rights to the most TRA tax benefit payments that the TRA be terminated upon a change in control without any payments to the TRA\nmembers and (ii) if such TRA members were unwilling to do so, request that they determine a spokesperson and counsel, if they so choose, to negotiate\nthe terms under which the TRA would be terminated or amended in connection with a change in control or conversion to a REIT. The special committee\nalso directed management to have Deloitte & Touche LLP (\u201cDeloitte\u201d), tax advisor to Switch, prepare an analysis of the early termination payment and tax\nbenefit payments that could be payable under the TRA, including all assumptions underlying the analysis. In addition, given the desire of the special\ncommittee to terminate or modify the TRA to obtain maximum value for stockholders in any Strategic Transaction, the special committee determined to\naccept Mr. Snyder\u2019s offer to step off the special committee and proposed that Ms. Pelletier, who had no interest in the TRA, replace Mr. Snyder as a\nmember of the special committee.\nOn February 14, 2022, after making a determination that Ms. Pelletier was (i) independent, (ii) not a current employee of Switch, (iii) disinterested in a\nStrategic Transaction and (iv) not a party to the TRA, the board, acting by unanimous written consent, approved the replacement of Mr. Snyder with Ms.\nPelletier, and on February 15, 2022, the special committee amended and restated its charter to authorize the special committee to negotiate the termination\nof, or amendment to, the TRA and elected Mr. Wolf as the chair of the special committee.\nOn February 22, 2022, the special committee, along with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham, met to discuss the status of\nnegotiations with potential bidders. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley updated the special committee on various initial and follow-up meetings held\nwith the nine potential bidders who had already executed nondisclosure agreements. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley noted that management had\nheld meetings with the nine potential bidders and continued to respond to diligence requests from the bidders. Following discussion, the special\ncommittee authorized Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to send a process letter to the nine interested bidders, including DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A\nand Bidder B, later that day requesting that interested bidders submit initial indicative offers by March 10, 2022.\nFrom February 22, 2022 through March 10, 2022, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continued to engage in discussions with potential bidders,\nincluding two additional bidders who entered the process in early March and mid-March, respectively, with respect to the terms of their potential bids\nand management, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham coordinated responses by Switch management to various diligence questions posed\n41\nTable of Contents\nby the bidders, including regarding the status and liability under the TRA. From February 18, 2022 through April 6, 2022, Goldman Sachs and Morgan\nStanley attended diligence calls with management to discuss and coordinate answers by the management team to various diligence questions posed by\nthe bidders.\nOn March 10, 2022, Switch received indicative offers from four potential bidders: DigitalBridge at $34.00 per share\u037e IFM, who did not submit a per share\nprice, but indicated they were willing to invest up to $2.5 billion\u037e Bidder A at $32.50 per share\u037e and Bidder B at a range of $28.00 - $31.00 per share. Each\nbid assumed, as directed by Switch, that no payment would be required pursuant to the TRA. Switch Class A common stock price on March 10, 2022\nclosed at $27.08 per share. Later in the day, the special committee met to discuss the various bids along with Latham, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\nAfter this discussion, the special committee determined to proceed in further discussions with each of the bidders.\nOn March 14, 2022, the board held a meeting, attended by representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management, to discuss the\nindicative offers received to date. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley summarized each bid and presented a proposed timeline for entering into definitive\nagreements. The board, Goldman Sachs and management then discussed the Switch Projections, including the material assumptions therein. For a\ndetailed discussion regarding the Switch Projections, please see \u201c\u2014Certain Unaudited Financial Projections\u201d beginning on page 52 of this proxy\nstatement.\nFrom late March 2022 through mid-April 2022, management and the board held additional in-person meetings with DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A and\nBidder B, and their respective advisors, including tours of Switch\u2019s various campuses, attended numerous diligence calls with each potential bidder and\ncontinued to populate the virtual data room in response to diligence requests from each potential bidder. During diligence calls in late March, potential\nbidders, including DigitalBridge and Bidder A, raised that in order to obtain certain real estate-style financing for the transaction, Switch would need to\namend its leases for certain of its properties in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nOn March 21, 2022, the media reported that Switch was considering a Strategic Transaction. On March 18, 2022, the last day of trading prior to the\nreporting, shares of Switch Class A common stock closed at $28.78 per share. On March 22, 2022, the first full day of trading after the reporting, shares of\nSwitch Class A common stock closed at $29.68 per share.\nOn March 30, 2022, DigitalBridge requested through the special committee\u2019s financial advisors that DigitalBridge and IFM be permitted to submit a joint-\nbid at the next deadline. The special committee\u2019s financial advisors informed DigitalBridge and IFM that Switch approved the submission of this joint-bid\non April 1, 2022 to allow the parties to put forth their most competitive bid.\nOn April 4 and April 5, 2022, the special committee held meetings, attended by representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham,\nmanagement and Deloitte, during which management and Deloitte discussed Switch\u2019s recorded liability under the TRA as of December 31, 2021 of $395.6\nmillion and the assumptions used by Switch in determining the liability. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley presented to the special committee an\nanalysis of the TRA tax benefit payments and early termination payments in various scenarios (in each case as provided to Goldman Sachs and Morgan\nStanley by Switch management), including upon a change in control, and under both Switch\u2019s existing Up-C corporate structure and after a REIT\nconversion, noting net present value of the TRA tax benefit payments after a REIT conversion was potentially lower and discussed further how this\nshould impact a special committee proposal to TRA members on terminating the TRA. In addition, the special committee authorized Goldman Sachs and\nMorgan Stanley to send a second round process letter to bidders, reviewed and provided input on the terms of an initial draft merger agreement to\nLatham and authorized Latham to make the draft merger agreement available to the bidders.\nOn April 5, 2022, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley provided a second round process letter to DigitalBridge (now bidding with IFM), Bidder A and\nBidder B and Latham uploaded a draft merger agreement to a virtual data room for review by bidders. The process letter directed bidders to provide a final\nbid no later than April 28, 2022.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOn April 7, 2022, the special committee held a meeting, attended by representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham, management and\nDeloitte. Management discussed the communications to date with certain TRA members, in which such TRA members expressed a willingness to amend\nthe TRA by reducing the payout to members in order to facilitate a Strategic Transaction, provided some consideration was paid to TRA members in\nconnection with any such transaction. Following discussion and based upon the analysis provided by Deloitte, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on\nthe amount of the tax benefit payments and early termination payments owed under various scenarios, including a change in control and after a REIT\nconversion, the state of discussions with bidders with respect to a Strategic Transaction, the significant early termination payment that would be due to\nTRA holders upon a change in control if no action was taken with respect to the TRA that would likely make a Strategic Transaction no longer attractive\nto Switch stockholders, and the significant number of TRA members required to satisfy the 70% Supermajority Threshold necessary to amend the TRA\npursuant to its terms, the special committee proposed to recommend to the board an aggregate payment of approximately $75 million paid to all parties to\nthe TRA, pro rata, in exchange for terminating the TRA upon the earlier of a change in control and December 31, 2022.\nFrom April 7, 2022 through April 12, 2022, management, the special committee and the board met to discuss next steps with regard to the TRA. Upon the\nrecommendation of the special committee, the board authorized Switch to enter into an amendment to the TRA that would provide for an aggregate\npayout to TRA members of approximately $75 million in exchange for the termination of all obligations under the TRA (the \u201cTRA Amendment\u201d). See \u201cThe\nMergers\u2014Amendment to the Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for a full summary of the TRA Amendment. The special committee believed that amendment\nwould offer the best opportunity to maximize stockholder value for the Strategic Transaction or conversion to a REIT. Management was also authorized to\nbegin soliciting approval from TRA members necessary to effect the TRA Amendment.\nOn April 15, Latham received revised merger agreement drafts from each of DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A. Bidder A also provided initial drafts of an\nequity commitment letter and a limited guarantee.\nOn April 20, 2022, the special committee met to discuss various transaction-related matters. Representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,\nLatham and management were in attendance. Management summarized for the special committee negotiations to effect a lease amendment for certain of\nSwitch\u2019s leased properties in the Las Vegas, Nevada area (the \u201cLeased Properties\u201d) that the bidders had requested as critical to obtaining their financing,\nand discussed with the special committee that because of Mr. Tom Thomas\u2019 ownership interests in the Leased Properties, as described more fully in the\nsection entitled \u201c- Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers,\u201d that he would not take part in discussions with respect to\nthe Leased Properties. Management then provided an update to the special committee regarding the ongoing process to solicit approvals from TRA\nmembers to satisfy the Supermajority Threshold to amend the TRA. Next, Latham provided the special committee a summary of the two merger agreement\nmarkups received and outlined the material issues therein. With respect to the DigitalBridge/IFM merger agreement, the special committee discussed,\namong other things, that (i) Mr. Roy and Mr. Morton were being asked to rollover a portion of their equity in connection with the transaction, (ii)\nDigitalBridge/IFM deleted several obligations to obtain antitrust approval between signing and closing, (iii) a number of additional regulatory approvals\nwere added as conditions to closing, (iv) DigitalBridge/IFM had proposed a buyer termination fee of 5% and a Switch termination fee of 3.75%, (v) the\ntransaction documents contemplated a mortgage debt commitment that contained additional closing conditionality as compared to a leveraged buyout\nfinancing and (vi) certain representations, warranties and covenants were revised to more buyer-friendly positions. With respect to the Bidder A merger\nagreement, the special committee discussed, among other things, that (i) the financing package proposed involved leverage buyout financing rather than\na mortgage debt commitment, (ii) Bidder A was requesting a similar management rollover equity condition as DigitalBridge/IFM, (iii) Bidder A had also\nlimited its obligations with respect to obtaining antitrust approval, (iv) a similar list of new regulatory approvals were proposed as conditions to closing,\n(v) Bidder A had proposed a Bidder A break fee of 6% and a Switch break fee of 3%, as well as an obligation for Switch to reimburse Bidder A for\nexpenses up to $30 million in the event of a failure to obtain stockholder approval and (vi) certain representations, warranties and covenants were revised\nto more buyer-\n43\nTable of Contents\nfriendly positions. Both DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A markups included obtaining voting agreements in support of the Mergers from all of the board\nand executive management team and certain stockholders. Following discussion of the draft merger agreements, the special committee directed Latham to\nnegotiate the merger agreement drafts with legal counsel to DigitalBridge/IFM, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (\u201cSTB\u201d), and with legal counsel for\nBidder A. The special committee also considered whether Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley should contact any additional parties as to their interest in\na Strategic Transaction with Switch, but noted that Switch\u2019s consideration of strategic alternatives had appeared in media reports and no other parties\nhad contacted Switch, Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley with interest in a Strategic Transaction.\nOn April 20, 2022, representatives for the owners of the Leased Properties informed management that they were not willing to amend the leases for the\nLeased Properties\u037e however, they would consider the sale of the Leased Properties to Switch (the \u201cLand Purchase\u201d). Management, after consultation with\nGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, notified the special committee that it believed such a purchase by Switch would facilitate financing that would allow\na higher price in a Strategic Transaction, and the special committee authorized negotiation of terms under which a purchase might be possible, including a\nclosing contingent upon a Strategic Transaction closing, and instructed management to bring back terms for final approval.\nOn April 21, 2022, Latham held separate calls with STB and the legal representatives of Bidder A to discuss their revised drafts of the merger agreement.\nLatham highlighted the material issues in the drafts, as well as certain other issues raised in other draft ancillary agreements submitted, and informed legal\ncounsel for each bidder that they should consider improving those positions in revised drafts to be submitted with their client\u2019s final bid.\nDuring the week of April 18, 2022, Bidder A informed Switch they would need to complete additional diligence in order to have their financing package\nfinalized in advance of submitting a bid. After discussions and in light of the status of ongoing negotiations in connection with the Land Purchase, the\nspecial committee elected to push the date for final bids from April 28, 2022 to May 5, 2022 in order to allow bidders additional time to finalize their bids,\nincluding their financing packages.\nFrom April 21, 2022 through May 5, 2022, management and Latham held numerous diligence calls with DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A and their\nrespective representatives relating to a number of matters, including diligence related to financing real estate, benefits, intellectual property, tax and\nvarious regulatory matters.\nOn April 22, 2022, management informed the special committee that TRA members satisfying the Supermajority Threshold had approved the TRA\nAmendment.\nOn April 28, 2022, Latham provided initial drafts of the Voting and Support Agreement and the Switch Disclosure Letter to STB and legal counsel for\nBidder A.\nOn May 3, 2022, the media reported that Switch was in negotiations to be purchased by Brookfield Asset Management. On May 5, 2022, the first full day\nof trading after the report, shares of Switch Class A common stock closed at $31.64 per share.\nOn May 4, 2022, representatives of Bidder B informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Bidder B would not submit a revised bid to acquire Switch.\nOn May 5, 2022, DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A provided revised bids to Switch, along with revised drafts of the Merger Agreement, financing\ndocuments and ancillary agreements. The revised bid from DigitalBridge/IFM proposed to acquire Switch for $34.25 per share, and DigitalBridge/IFM\noffered to connect executives of their financing partners with the special committee\u2019s financial advisors to demonstrate DigitalBridge/IFM\u2019s commitment\nto the financing. The revised bid from Bidder A proposed to acquire Switch for $29.00 per share, and Bidder A communicated that this reflected a change\nin market conditions that impacted financing costs, the impact of the TRA Amendment and the Land Purchase.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOn May 6, 2022, the special committee met to discuss the terms of the final bids and revised transaction documents. Representatives from Goldman\nSachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management were in attendance. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley summarized the terms of the bids and Latham\nhighlighted certain key issues remaining in the transaction documents. With respect to DigitalBridge/IFM, the special committee considered, among other\nthings, that the transaction documents continued to contemplate a mortgage debt commitment that contained additional closing conditionality as\ncompared to a leveraged buyout financing and a DigitalBridge/IFM termination fee of 5% and a Switch termination fee of 3.75%. With respect to Bidder\nA, the special committee considered, among other things, that the transaction documents continued to contemplate a leveraged buyout financing, certain\nlimitations on Bidder A\u2019s obligations to obtain regulatory approval and an obligation for Switch to reimburse Bidder A for expenses up to $30 million in\nthe event of a failure to obtain stockholder approval. The special committee provided their views and instructed Latham to go back and negotiate with\nDigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A for key terms, including informing DigitalBridge/IFM that their mortgage debt commitment disadvantaged their bid and\nthat they should obtain a leveraged buyout financing to give their bid additional closing certainty. During the May 6, 2022 special committee meeting, the\nspecial committee also discussed the status of negotiations for the Land Purchase. Management informed the special committee that negotiations\nremained ongoing, particularly with respect to the total price for the Land Purchase.\nOn May 7, 2022, the special committee met, along with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management, to discuss a\nnumber of transaction-related issues, including communication to each of DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A regarding increasing their offer price and\naccepting certain revisions to the terms of the transaction documents, including, with respect to DigitalBridge/IFM, revising their financing to provide\nimproved deal closing certainty, the status of negotiations regarding the Land Purchase and requests in the bid letter from each bidder that Messrs. Roy\nand Morton exchange an aggregate of approximately $500 million of equity in connection with the transaction. Mr. Morton informed the special committee\nthat he and Mr. Roy were amenable to rolling over the requested amount of equity were Switch to enter into a definitive agreement with the winning\nbidder, and had engaged their own counsel that was prepared to negotiate the terms of any rollover and that they would not negotiate with either bidder\non the terms of any rollover until the special committee authorized them to do so. Furthermore, Mr. Roy and Mr. Morton both agreed that neither would\ndiscuss their respective employment status or compensation matters with the bidders until authorized to do so by the special committee.\nLater on May 7, 2022, Latham sent revised drafts of all transaction documents back to STB and Bidder A\u2019s legal representative. From May 7, 2022 until\nMay 11, 2022, Latham, STB and the legal representatives of Bidder A, as applicable, traded revised drafts of the various transaction documents and\nnegotiated the key open points remaining in the documents.\nDuring the evening on May 7, 2022, in response to the proposal for Messrs. Roy and Morton to rollover their Switch equity, Latham forwarded to STB\nand legal counsel for Bidder A a draft rollover term sheet prepared by counsel for Messrs. Roy and Morton. Latham communicated to STB and legal\ncounsel for Bidder A that the winning bidder would be connected with counsel to Messrs. Roy and Morton to negotiate the terms thereof in advance of\nsigning.\nOn May 8, 2022, the special committee, along with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management, met to continue to\ndiscuss the bids received from DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley informed the special committee that Bidder A had\nagreed to increase its offer price to $30.00 per share from $29.00 per share. Following the discussion, the special committee authorized Goldman Sachs and\nMorgan Stanley to communicate to each bidder to improve its bid price in order to finalize a transaction and, additionally with respect to\nDigitalBridge/IFM, to seek to improve the certainty of its financing package. With respect to the Land Purchase, both bidders had been informed of the\nnegotiations and reiterated to Switch that the Land Purchase would need to be finalized in advance of executing definitive agreements for the proposed\nStrategic Transaction.\nOn May 9, 2022, the special committee held two meetings and the full board met once to discuss various transaction-related matters. Each of these\nmeetings were also attended by representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management. During the morning meetings, Goldman\nSachs and Morgan Stanley\n45\nTable of Contents\ninformed the special committee (i) that Bidder A had agreed to increase its offer price to $32.50 per share from $30.00 and conditioned this price on signing\nthe transaction by end of day and (ii) that DigitalBridge/IFM had agreed to make certain improvements to the terms of its financing package and the draft\nmerger agreement to improve closing certainty, including by limiting certain conditions to funding and limiting the possibility of a material breach claim by\nDigitalBridge/IFM in connection with Switch\u2019s obligations to provide financing cooperation between signing and closing. Following these meetings and\nsignificant discussion on the topics among the special committee, the board, management, Latham, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the special\ncommittee concluded it was in the best interest of maximizing stockholder value to authorize Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to inform each bidder\nthat (i) Switch intended to consummate a transaction with one of the bidders prior to market open on May 11, 2022, (ii) that each bidder should provide a\n\u201cbest and final\u201d offer by the following morning, which should include an increase in offer price and (iii) that DigitalBridge/IFM should continue to make\nimprovements to its financing package to provide for greater closing certainty.\nAlso on May 9, 2022, the media reported that Switch was in advanced discussions with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and DigitalBridge for the sale\nof Switch. On May 6, 2022, the last day of trading prior to the report, shares of Switch Class A common stock closed at $30.49 per share. On May 10, 2022,\nthe first full day of trading after the report, shares of Switch Class A common stock closed at $30.75 per share.\nBoth the special committee and the board met separately on multiple occasions over the course of the day on May 10, 2022. In attendance during these\nmeetings were representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management. During these meetings, representatives of Morgan\nStanley, Goldman Sachs and Latham, as applicable, reported to the special committee and the board that (i) Bidder A had informed Morgan Stanley that it\nwas unwilling to increase its offer price beyond $32.50 and that they would not negotiate further for the purchase of Switch at a higher price and (ii)\nDigitalBridge/IFM had offered an increased break fee of $693 million, or approximately 8% of the equity value that would be payable upon certain\nbreaches of the merger agreement. Management also informed the special committee that Switch was close to reaching terms in connection with the Land\nPurchase for a total purchase price of $300 million. The closing price per share of Switch Class A common stock on May 10, 2022 was $30.75.\nLater in the day on May 10, 2022, the board met to discuss the revised terms proposed by DigitalBridge/IFM. Following significant discussion among the\nboard, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham, taking into account the outreach, negotiations, transaction terms and offer prices, the board voiced\nits support for pursuing a transaction with DigitalBridge. Following the board meeting, the special committee convened a meeting and following extensive\ndiscussions, the special committee determined that the DigitalBridge/IFM proposal provided the best value to Switch stockholders, and authorized\nGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to convey to DigitalBridge and IFM that Switch was interested in executing definitive documentation for a\ntransaction prior to market opening on the following day and that DigitalBridge/IFM should increase its offer by an additional $0.25 per share in order to\nsecure the transaction. When making this determination, the special committee took into account that DigitalBridge/IFM had made a number of\nconcessions with respect to its mortgage debt financing over a short period of time, including improving closing certainty by limiting certain conditions\nto funding and limiting the possibility of a material breach claim by DigitalBridge/IFM in connection with Switch\u2019s obligations to cooperate with regards\nto the financing between signing and closing. The board of directors of Switch also determined, after consultation with Goldman Sachs and Morgan\nStanley, that the proposal by DigitalBridge/IFM had an acceptable level of risk around the financing and closing certainty.\nDuring the early evening on May 10, 2022, DigitalBridge/IFM communicated that $34.25 was their best and final offer price. DigitalBridge/IFM noted that\nthis was an increase from their initial offer of $34.00 per share, which offer did not contemplate the additional approximately $75 million payment in\nconnection with the TRA Amendment or the $300 million payment in connection with the Land Purchase. Because DigitalBridge/IFM had communicated\nthat any Strategic Transaction was conditioned on Messrs. Roy and Morton rolling over their Switch equity, the special committee authorized Messrs.\nRoy and Morton to have discussions and negotiations with DigitalBridge/IFM regarding the terms of their equity rollover. During the course of the\nevening, counsel\n46\nTable of Contents\nfor Messrs. Roy and Morton was connected with STB, exchanged drafts of the rollover term sheet with DigitalBridge/IFM and STB and negotiated terms\nof the rollover with DigitalBridge/IFM and STB.\nDuring the late evening on May 10, 2022, the board convened along with management, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham. Goldman Sachs\nreviewed with the board Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses of the merger consideration, and rendered to the special committee an oral opinion, which was\nsubsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated May 11, 2022, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various\nqualifications, assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received by holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the\noutstanding shares of Switch Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a\ndetailed discussion of Goldman Sachs\u2019s opinion, please see \u201c- Opinion of the Special Committee\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 54 of this\nproxy statement. Latham then reviewed the proposed final terms of the Merger Agreement and the related ancillary agreements and presented to the\nboard regarding their fiduciary obligations under Nevada law in connection with the proposed transaction. Management for Switch also informed the\nboard and the special committee that, based upon, among other things, their views of Switch\u2019s prospects on a standalone basis, its consideration of all\nthe alternatives available to Switch and the information and advice provided by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham, it was Switch executive\nmanagement\u2019s recommendation that the board approve the transaction as proposed by DigitalBridge/IFM upon the terms negotiated by the parties and\nset forth in the definitive documents. Next, the special committee informed the board that, based upon, among other things, its consideration of all the\nalternatives available to Switch and the information and advice provided by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham over the course of evaluating\nStrategic Transactions, it was the special committee\u2019s recommendation that the board approve the transaction as proposed by DigitalBridge/IFM upon\nthe terms negotiated by the parties and set forth in the definitive documents.

For a detailed description of the various reasons considered by the board, see \u201c- Recommendation of the Board of\nDirectors and the Special Committee\u201d beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement. After further discussion, including a review of the status of\nSwitch\u2019s business, the process that led to the proposed Mergers, the alternatives available to Switch, including remaining as a public company, and the\nrisks and benefits associated with the proposed transaction, the board unanimously (other than Mr. Roy who informed the special committee and the\nboard that he was supportive of the transaction and would vote for the transaction in the interest of all stockholders, but under advice of counsel,\nrecused himself from the vote given his agreement to participate in a rollover of a portion of his equity) (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the LLC Merger and the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of Switch, Switch, Ltd., and\nSunshine Merger Sub, Ltd., respectively, and their respective stockholders or equityholders, as applicable, on the terms and subject to the conditions set\nforth in the Merger Agreement, (ii) directed that the Mergers be submitted for consideration at a special meeting of Switch\u2019s stockholders and (iii)\nrecommended that Switch\u2019s stockholders approve the Merger. The Land Purchase was also approved as part of the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement.\nPrior to the market opening on May 11, 2022, Latham and STB finalized all transaction documents and Switch, Switch, Ltd., Sunshine Merger Sub, Ltd.,\nSunshine Bidco Inc. and Sunshine Parent Merger Sub Inc. executed the Merger Agreement and the ancillary agreements to be executed in connection\ntherewith.\nBefore NYSE opened on May 11, 2022, DigitalBridge/IFM and Switch issued a press release announcing the entry into the Merger Agreement.\nReasons for the Mergers",

            "text": "Certain Unaudited Financial Projections\nWhile Switch from time to time provides a financial outlook to investors with respect to the then-current fiscal year, Switch has not, as a matter of course,\notherwise publicly disclosed longer-term internal projections as to future performance, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the\nuncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the Mergers, prior to the\nexecution of the Merger Agreement, Switch management prepared and provided to the board in connection with its evaluation of the Mergers and the\nspecial committee\u2019s financial advisor, Goldman Sachs, for its use and reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion, certain nonpublic,\ninternal, financial projections regarding Switch\u2019s future operations for fiscal years 2022 through 2031 (the \u201cSwitch Projections\u201d). The Switch Projections\nwere also provided to DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A, Bidder B and each of their respective advisors and representatives. Switch has included below a\nsummary of the Switch Projections for the purpose of providing stockholders access to certain nonpublic information that was prepared for the board,\nGoldman Sachs, DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A, Bidder B and each of their respective advisors and representatives for purposes of evaluating the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not included to influence\nyour decision, if you are a Switch stockholder, to vote in favor of the Mergers. The inclusion of this summary should not be regarded as an indication\nthat Switch management or anyone who received the Switch Projections then considered, or now considers, them to be a reliable prediction of future\nevents, and the Switch Projections should not be relied upon as such. This information is not fact and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance\non the Switch Projections.\nThe Switch Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance with published\nguidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentations of financial projections, but in the\nview of management, were prepared on a reasonable basis and reflect the assumptions and estimates available at the time they were prepared. The\nprospective financial information requires significant estimates and assumptions that make it inherently less comparable to the similarly titled GAAP\nmeasures in Switch\u2019s historical GAAP financial statements. The Switch Projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Switch\nmanagement and were not prepared with the assistance of, or reviewed, compiled or examined by, independent accountants.\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the Switch Projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions (including those related to industry\nperformance and general business, economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Switch\u2019s businesses) that are inherently\nsubjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of Switch\u2019s management. Important factors that may affect actual results\n52Table of Contents\nand cause the Switch Projections to not be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Switch\u2019s businesses (including its\nability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business, economic, competitive,\nregulatory and financial market conditions and other factors described under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and other risk\nfactors described in Switch\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March\n31, 2022 and current reports on Form 8-K. The Switch Projections also reflect numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time they\nwere prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the\nSwitch Projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Switch stockholders are urged to\nreview the most recent SEC filings of Switch for a description of the reported and anticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital\nresources during 2021, including in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Switch\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022 and current reports on Form 8-\nK.\nThe inclusion of a summary of the Switch Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of Switch or its officers,\ndirectors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives considered the Switch Projections to necessarily be predictive of actual future events, and the\nSwitch Projections should not be relied upon as such nor should the information contained in the Switch Projections be considered appropriate for other\npurposes. None of Switch or its officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not\ndiffer materially from the Switch Projections. The Switch Projections were prepared by Switch prior to entry into and public announcement of the\nMergers, have not been updated as of the date of this proxy statement and Switch undertakes no obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the\nSwitch Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Switch Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events,\neven in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Switch Projections are shown to be in error. The Switch Projections cover multiple\nyears, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.\nSwitch has not made and makes no representation to any person in the Merger Agreement or otherwise concerning the Switch Projections or regarding\nSwitch\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Switch Projections or that the projected results will be achieved. Switch urges\nall stockholders to review Switch\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a description of Switch\u2019s reported financial results.\nThe Switch Projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions, including the variables discussed above, as well as the following material\nassumptions: (i) Switch conversion to a REIT in 2023, (ii) 55% adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\") dividend payout policy from 2023 onwards, (iii)\n$0 in taxes as part of the REIT conversion, (iii) maximum debt / EBITDA ratio of 6.0x, (iv) equity offerings of $200 million in Q3 2023 and $220 million in Q3\n2024 to fund existing growth and capital expenditures and (v) termination of any TRA liability for a total payment in 2022 of $75 million. The Switch\nProjections were also provided without the assumption of Switch converting to a REIT and with other REIT conversion sensitivity analyses around\naccelerated depreciation and tax structure. The Switch Projections do not give effect to the Mergers. The Switch Projections were provided to\nDigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A, Bidder B and each of their respective advisors and representatives and a summary is presented in the following table, with\nall figures rounded to the nearest million. Switch management directed Goldman Sachs to use and rely upon the Switch Projections for purposes of its\nopinion and related financial analyses and the Switch Projections were approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019s use by the board.

            "text": "Opinion of the Special Committee\u2019s Financial Advisor\nGoldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the special committee of the board of directors of Switch that, as of May 11, 2022 and based upon and subject to\nthe factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $34.25 in cash per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent\nand its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view\nto such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated May 11, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered\nand limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its\nopinion for the information and assistance of the special committee in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is\nnot a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock or any other securities of Switch should vote with respect to\nthe Merger, or any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Switch for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Switch\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for Switch\u037e\n54Table of Contents\n\u2022\ncertain other communications from Switch to its stockholders\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Switch Projections, as prepared by management of Switch and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the special committee of the board\nof directors of Switch.\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Switch regarding their assessment of the past and current business\noperations, financial condition, and future prospects of Switch\u037e reviewed the reported price and trading activity for Switch\u2019s Class A common stock\u037e\ncompared certain financial and stock market information for Switch with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly\ntraded\u037e reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the data center industry and in other industries\u037e and performed such other\nstudies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the special committee, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without\nassuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of the special committee, that\nthe Switch Projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the special committee.\nGoldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-\nbalance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Switch or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs\nassumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any\nadverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the Merger will be\nconsummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in\nany way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Switch to engage in the transaction or the relative merits of the\ntransaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Switch\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $34.25 in cash per share of\nSwitch\u2019s Class A common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Switch\u2019s Class A common\nstock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the\nMerger Agreement or the transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into\nor amended in connection with the Merger, including the TRA and any amendments (including the TRA Amendment) and related payments thereunder,\nand the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities (including the\nshares of Switch\u2019s Class B common stock, the shares of Switch\u2019s Class C common stock (none of which are outstanding) and the Company Ltd. Common\nUnits), creditors, or other constituencies of Switch\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the\nofficers, directors or employees of Switch, or class of such persons in connection with the Mergers, whether relative to the $34.25 in cash per share of\nSwitch\u2019s Class A common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Switch\u2019s Class A common\nstock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary market and other\nconditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for\nupdating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman\nSachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential\neffects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Switch, Parent or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability\nof the Switch, Company Ltd. or Parent, or the ability of the Switch, Company Ltd. or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the special committee of the board of directors of Switch in\nconnection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial\nanalyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by\nGoldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with\nthe full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following\nquantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before May 10, 2022, the last trading day\nbefore the date of the public announcement of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nHistorical Stock Trading Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock\npursuant to the Merger Agreement in relation to:\n\u2022\n$26.62, the volume weighted average price (the \u201cVWAP\u201d) per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock over the 1-month-trading period\nended March 18, 2022, the last trading day before media reports that Switch was exploring a sale of the company (the \u201c1-Month\nUndisturbed VWAP\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$26.36, the VWAP of per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock over the 3-month-trading period ended March 18, 2022 (the \u201c3-Month\nUndisturbed VWAP\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$26.10, the VWAP per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock over the 6-month-trading period ended March 18, 2022 (the \u201c6-Month\nUndisturbed VWAP\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$28.78, the highest closing price per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock for the 52-week period ended March 18, 2022 (the \u201c52-Week\nHigh (Undisturbed) Price\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\n$31.64, the highest current closing price per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock for the 52-week period ended May 10, 2022 (the \u201c52-\nWeek High (Current) Price\u201d).\nThis analysis indicated that the price per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement represented:\nReference Price per Share of Company common stock\nImplied\nPremium/\nDiscount\n(Undisturbed\nPrice)\n1-Month Undisturbed VWAP of $26.62\n28.6%\n3-Month Undisturbed VWAP of $26.36\n30.0%\n6-Month Undisturbed VWAP of $26.10\n31.2%\n52-Week High (Undisturbed) Price of $28.78\n19.0%\n52-Week High (Current) Price of $31.64\n8.2%\nSelected Companies Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial information for Switch and for the following publicly traded\ncorporations in the data center industry (collectively, the \u201cSelected Companies\u201d):\n\u2022\nCyrusOne\n\u2022\nEquinix Inc.\n\u2022\nDigital Realty\nAlthough none of the Selected Companies is directly comparable to Switch, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded\ncompanies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Switch.\n56\nTable of Contents\nGoldman Sachs calculated for each of the Selected Companies:\n\u2022\nenterprise value as of May 10, 2022 (or, in the case of CyrusOne, March 29, 2022, which was the last day of public trading of CyrusOne\ncommon stock) as a multiple of the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (\u201cIBES\u201d) estimates of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation\nand amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) (the \u201cEV/ EBITDA Multiple\u201d) for 2022 and 2023\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe closing share price on May 10, 2022 (or, in the case of CyrusOne, March 29, 2022, which was the last day of public trading of CyrusOne\ncommon stock) as a multiple of the IBES estimates of adjusted funds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) (the \u201cP/ AFFO Multiple\u201d) for 2022 and 2023.\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs calculated for Switch:\n\u2022\nthe EV/EBITDA Multiple using the enterprise values as of May 10, 2022 and March 18, 2022, respectively, and IBES estimates and the\nSwitch Projections, respectively, for 2022 and 2023\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe P/AFFO Multiple using the closing price on May 10, 2022 and March 18, 2022, respectively, and IBES estimates and the Switch\nProjections, respectively, for 2022 and 2023.\nThe following table presents the result of these calculations:\nSwitch\n(Switch\nProjections,\nMay 10,\n2022\nclosing\nprice)\nSwitch\n(Switch\nProjections,\nMarch 18,\n2022\nclosing\nprice)\nSwitch\n(IBES,\nMay 10,\n2022\nclosing\nprice)\nSwitch\n(IBES,\nMarch\n18,\n2022\nclosing\nprice)\nSelected\nCompanies\nEV/ EBITDA Multiple (2022 estimates)\n27.6x\n26.2x\n27.3x\n25.8x\nRange:\n20.0x\n\u2013 23.5x\nMedian:\n21.0x\nEV/ EBITDA Multiple (2023 estimates)\n24.9x\n23.6x\n24.3x\n23.1x\nRange:\n18.3x\n\u2013 21.6x\nMedian:\n18.9x\nP/ AFFO Multiple (2022 estimates)\n27.0x\n25.2\n28.0\n26.2x\nRange:\n18.5x\n\u2013 21.6x\nMedian:\n21.0x\nP/ AFFO Multiple (2023 estimates)\n25.2x\n23.6x\n25.2\n24.2x\nRange:\n17.2x\n\u2013 20.4x\nMedian:\n19.8x\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative\nfuture value per share of the Switch\u2019s Class A common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value\nof a company\u2019s equity as a function of such company\u2019s financial multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Switch Projections for each of the\nfiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs first calculated (a) implied enterprise values for Switch, as of December 31 for each of fiscal years 2022 to 2024,\nby applying EV / next twelve month \u201cNTM\u201d EBITDA multiples ranging from 22.0x to 26.0x to EBITDA estimates for each of fiscal years 2023 to 2025 and\n(b) implied future share prices for Switch\u2019s Class A common stock as of December 31 for each of fiscal years 2022 to 2024, by applying P/NTM AFFO\nmultiples ranging from 21.0x to 25.0x to AFFO estimates for each of fiscal years 2023 to 2025. These illustrative EV/NTM EBITDA and P/AFFO multiples\nwere derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical enterprise value to EBITDA\nand AFFO multiples for Switch and the Selected Companies. Goldman Sachs then, in the case of the analysis using EV/NTM EBITDA multiples,\nsubtracted the amount of Switch\u2019s forecasted net debt as of December 31, 2022 to 2024, using the Switch Projections, from the implied enterprise values to\nderive a range of illustrative implied equity values for Switch as of December 31 for each of the years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs then, in the case of the\nanalysis using EV/NTM EBITDA multiples, divided these implied equity values by the number of projected year-end fully diluted shares of the Switch\u2019s\ncommon stock for each of the years 2022 to\n57\nTable of Contents\n2024, each as provided by management of Switch and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the special committee, to derive an illustrative range of implied\nfuture share prices for Switch\u2019s Class A common stock. Goldman Sachs then, in the case of both the analysis using EV/NTM EBITDA multiples and the\nanalysis using P/NTM AFFO multiples, discounted these implied future share prices back to March 31, 2022 using an illustrative discount rate of 8.2%,\nreflecting an estimate of Switch\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which\nrequires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for Switch, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.\nThis analysis using the EV/NTM EBITDA multiples resulted in a range of implied present values of $23.99 to $35.32 per share of Switch\u2019s Class A\ncommon stock. This analysis using the P/NTM AFFO multiples resulted in a range of implied present values of $24.29 to $34.25 per share of Switch\u2019s\nClass A common stock.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Switch Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on\nSwitch. Using discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 8.0%, reflecting estimates of Switch\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to\npresent value as of March 31, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Switch for the years 2022 through 2031 as reflected in the Switch\nProjections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Switch, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to\n2.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the free cash flow to be generated by Switch, as reflected in the Switch Projections. Goldman Sachs derived such\ndiscount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company\u2019s target capital\nstructure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for\nthe company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by\nGoldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Switch Projections and market expectations regarding long-\nterm real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Switch by adding the ranges\nof present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Switch the net debt of\nSwitch as of March 31, 2022, as provided by management of Switch, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Switch. Goldman Sachs then divided\nthe range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Switch, as provided by management Switch to derive\na range of illustrative present values per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock ranging from $24.44 to $37.78.\nSelected Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions (\u201cSelected Transactions\u201d) in\nthe data center industry since 2015.\nTier 1 Selected Transactions\nDate of Announcement\nAcquirer\nTarget\nNovember 15, 2021\nKKR\u037e\nGlobal Infrastructure Partners\nCyrusOne\nNovember 15, 2021\nAmerican Tower Corporation\nCoreSite\nJune 7, 2021\nBlackstone\nQTS\nOctober 29, 2019\nDigital Realty\nInterxion\nJune 9, 2017\nDigital Realty\nDFT\nOther Selected Transactions:\nDate of Announcement\nAcquirer\nTarget\nAugust 19, 2020\nEQT\nEdgeConnex\nJanuary 10, 2020\nMacquarie\nAirTrunk\nSeptember 24, 2018\nDigital Realty\u037e\nBrookfield\nAscenty\n58\nTable of Contents\nDate of Announcement\nAcquirer\nTarget\nDecember 7, 2016\nEquinix\nVerizon\nNovember 4, 2016\nBC Partners\u037e\nMedina Capital\nCentury Link\nMay 29, 2015\nEquinix\nTelecityGroup\nFor each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated the enterprise value, represented by the transaction, as a multiple of the target\ncompany\u2019s EBITDA as reported or calculated using publicly available financial information for the applicable trailing twelve-month period (\u201cEV/LTM\nEBITDA multiples\u201d), except that for the Macquarie/AirTrunk and Digital Realty-Brookfield/Ascenty transactions, Goldman Sachs used the EV/NTM\nEBITDA multiples due to limited publicly available information. While none of the target companies that participated in the selected transactions are\ndirectly comparable to Switch, the target companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes of\nanalysis, may be considered similar to certain of Switch\u2019s results, market size and product profile.\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\nRange\nMedian\nEV/LTM EBITDA\nTier 1: 22.8x-29.6x\nOther: 12.0x-33.3x\nTier 1: 26.0x\nOther: 24.0x\nBased on the results of the foregoing calculations of EV/LTM EBITDA multiples and Goldman Sachs\u2019 professional judgment and experience, Goldman\nSachs\u2019 applied a reference range of EV/LTM EBITDA multiples of 26.0x, representing the median for the Tier 1 Selected Transactions, to 29.6x,\nrepresenting the multiple for the American Tower/CoreSite transaction, to Switch\u2019s LTM EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter of 2022, as provided by\nmanagement of Switch, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for Switch. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from this range of implied enterprise\nvalues net debt of Switch as of March 31, 2022, as provided by management of Switch, and divided the result by the total number of fully diluted shares\noutstanding as of March 31, 2022, as provided by management of Switch, to derive a range of implied values per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock\nof $26.54 to $31.09.\nPremia Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition transactions\nannounced during the time period from 2012 through May 10, 2022 involving targets that were publicly traded companies in the technology, media and\ntelecom industry in the United States and publicly traded REITs in the United States in which the disclosed enterprise values for the transactions were\ngreater than $1.0 billion. For each full calendar year (and for the period ending May 10, 2022 in the case of 2022) during this period and for the entire\nperiod overall, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the average, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in\nthe transactions relative to the applicable targets\u2019 last undisturbed 52-week high closing stock prices prior to announcement of the transactions. This\nanalysis indicated an average premium of 6% for the entire period overall and a range of average premia per annum for each of the years (and for the\nperiod ending May 10, 2022 in the case of 2022) of negative 2% to 18%. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of negative 3% and 75th\npercentile premium of 16% for the entire period overall and a range of 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia per annum for each of the years (and for\nthe period ending May 10, 2022 in the case of 2022) of negative 9% to 5% for the 25th percentile premia per annum and of 7% to 32% for the 75th\npercentile premia per annum. Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs\u2019 professional judgment and experience, Goldman\nSachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of (3)% to 16%, representing the 25th percentile premium and the 75th percentile premium for the\nentire period in the foregoing analysis, to the undisturbed 52-week high closing price per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock of $28.78 as of March\n18, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock of $27.92 to $33.38.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and\ndid not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis\nof its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a\ncomparison is directly comparable to Switch or the merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the special committee as to the fairness from a financial\npoint of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock of the\n$34.25 in cash per share of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport\nto be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of\nfuture results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.\nBecause these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their\nrespective advisors, none of Switch, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those\nforecast.\nThe merger consideration of $34.25 in cash per shares of Switch\u2019s Class A common stock was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between\nSwitch and Parent and was approved by the special committee. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the special committee during these negotiations.\nGoldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the special committee or that any specific amount of consideration\nconstituted the only appropriate consideration for the Mergers.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the special committee was one of many factors taken into consideration by the special committee in\nmaking its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses\nperformed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs\nattached as Annex B.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment\nmanagement and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities.

            "text": "Amendment to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nThe following summary describes certain relevant provisions of the TRA and the material provisions of the TRA Amendment. The descriptions of the\nTRA and the TRA Amendment in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to\nthe TRA and the TRA Amendment, each of which is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the TRA and the\nTRA Amendment carefully and in their entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the TRA and the TRA Amendment that is\nimportant to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the TRA and the TRA Amendment and not by this\nsummary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nConcurrent with the initial public offering of its Class A common stock, the Company entered into the TRA with Company Ltd. and the members of\nCompany Ltd. party thereto. Exchanges or redemptions of Company Ltd. Common Units for cash or shares of Class A common stock are expected to\nproduce favorable tax attributes for the Company. When the Company acquires Company Ltd. Common Units from such members through these\nexchanges or redemptions, anticipated tax basis adjustments are likely to increase (for tax purposes) the Company\u2019s depreciation and amortization\ndeductions, thereby reducing the amount of income tax that the Company would be required to pay in the future in the absence of this increased basis.\nThis increased tax basis may also decrease the gain (or increase the loss) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent that the tax basis is\nallocated to those assets. Under the terms of the TRA, absent a change of control of the Company, the Company would generally be required to pay to\nmembers of Company Ltd. party to the TRA 85% of the applicable savings, if any, in income tax that the Company realizes, or that the Company is deemed\nto realize, as a result of (1) these tax attributes that are created as a result of the exchanges or redemptions of the such members\u2019 Company Ltd. Common\nUnits (calculated under certain assumptions), (2) tax benefits related to imputed interest, and (3) payments under the TRA. Amendment of the TRA\nrequires the approval of members of Company Ltd. satisfying the Supermajority Threshold.\n64Table of Contents\nIn addition, the TRA provides that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination or other changes of control were to occur, then the\nTRA would terminate and the Company\u2019s obligations, or the Company\u2019s successor\u2019s obligations, under the TRA would accelerate and become due and\npayable. Absent the TRA Amendment, the amount of such accelerated change of control payment obligations would have been calculated as aggregate\npayment obligations under the TRA absent a change of control based on certain assumptions set forth in the TRA, including the assumption that the\nCompany would have sufficient taxable income in each taxable year ending on or after the change of control to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits\nthat are subject to the TRA and that any un-exchanged Company Ltd. Common Units would be exchanged for cash at the market value of the Class A\ncommon stock as of the closing of the change of control, and applying a discount rate to those payments equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The\nMergers, upon closing, constitute a change of control under the TRA that would cause the payment obligations to accelerate and become due and\npayable.\nFor more information with respect to the TRA, please see our other filings with the SEC. A copy of the TRA is included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company\u2019s\nForm S-1 Registration Statement filed with the SEC on September 8, 2017.\nAs a result of negotiation by the special committee, on May 11, 2022, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, Company\nLtd. and members of Company Ltd. satisfying the Supermajority Threshold entered into, which was concurrently publicly filed, the TRA Amendment, in\naccordance with the terms of the TRA. The TRA Amendment establishes that in exchange for the termination of the TRA and all rights associated\ntherewith, the parties to the TRA (other than the Company) will be entitled to receive a payment in cash from the Company of $0.37 per Company Ltd.\nCommon Unit (such implied price equating to $5.89 per share of Company Class A common stock if there were no reduction in the amount of aggregate\naccelerated change of control payments required to be made under the then-current terms of the TRA) in connection with the closing of the Mergers in\nfull satisfaction of the payment obligations to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA. Such payments will be made by the Company as promptly as\npracticable following the earlier of (i) the closing of the Mergers (or any other change of control of the Company (as defined in the TRA)), or (ii)\nDecember 31, 2022. This represents a reduction of approximately $1,121 million, which is an approximately 93.72% reduction of the estimated aggregate\namount of approximately $1,196 million that would have otherwise been payable to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA in respect of a change of control\nof the Company at the implied price per share of Class A common stock offered by Parent, absent the TRA Amendment.\nRollover Agreements",

Both the Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the Antitrust\nDivision of the DOJ on May 25, 2022. Following discussions between the Company and Parent and the DOJ, Parent withdrew its Notification and Report\nForm effective June 24, 2022. Parent plans to refile its Notification and Report Form on June 28, 2022, which will start a new 30-day waiting period with\nrespect to the Merger under the HSR Act, which cannot expire on a Saturday, Sunday or a U.S. federal holiday. The withdrawal and refiling are standard\nprocedural steps that provide the DOJ with additional time to complete its review of the proposed Merger. Assuming Parent refiles its Notification and\nReport Form on June 28, 2022, the new waiting period will expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on July 28, 2022, unless the FTC or the DOJ earlier terminates\nthe waiting period or issues requests for additional information and documentary material related to the Merger (\u201cSecond Requests\u201d). If the FTC or the\nDOJ issues Second Requests, the waiting period with respect to the Merger will be extended for an additional period of 30 calendar days, which will begin\non the date on which both the Company and Parent have substantially complied with their respective Second Requests. Complying with Second\nRequests can take a significant period of time. The Company continues to anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the second half of 2022,\nassuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the Mergers.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the\napplicable antitrust authorities could take such action under applicable antitrust laws as each deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,\nincluding seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain\ncircumstances. We cannot assure you that the FTC, DOJ, any state attorney general, or any other U.S. or foreign government authority will not attempt to\nchallenge the Merger on antitrust grounds, and, if such a challenge is made, we cannot assure you as to its result.\nAdditional Approvals\nIn addition, the parties expect to (1) submit a change of control application to the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) for certain wireless\nlicenses held by the Company, (2) submit an application for and\n75\nTable of Contents\nreceive approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d), (3) receive authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission (\u201cFERC\u201d) with respect to the termination of the market-based rate authorization issued to a subsidiary of the Company and (4) provide\nnotices to and seek\napprovals from certain state regulatory agencies. The consummation of the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of these approvals or upon providing\nnotice, as applicable. The Company and Parent made the appropriate applications with the FCC on May 27, 2022 and with FERC on May 24, 2022,\nnotifications with each of the Georgia Public Service Commission and Nevada Public Utilities Commission on May 26, 2022 and notifications to the\nNevada Gaming Commission and Michigan Control Gaming Control Board on May 20, 2022.

The\ntax consequences of the Merger under U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable\nstate, local, and non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed.

Accordingly, partnerships holding our common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX OR LEGAL ADVICE.

The amount of any taxable gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder who receives merger consideration for shares of our\ncommon stock in the Merger will generally equal the difference, if any, between the amount of merger consideration received for such shares (determined\nbefore the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in a\nshare will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for such share. The amount and character of such gain or loss and the holding period of\nshares will be determined separately for each block of shares of our common stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction)\nexchanged for merger consideration in the Merger. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder upon the receipt of merger consideration in exchange for a\nshare of our common stock in the Merger will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such\nshare for more than one year at the effective time of the Merger. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss which is subject to\nU.S. federal income tax at the same rates as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including\nindividuals, are generally taxable at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made to a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS\nand backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup withholding on such payments, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an\nexemption should complete and return to the paying agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal certifying that such\nholder is a United States person, that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such holder is not subject to backup withholding.\nCertain holders (including corporations) are not subject to backup withholding or information reporting rules.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from payments of merger consideration to a U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger under\nthe backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against such U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the\nrequired information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from\nbackup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.\nTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\nDefinition of a Non-U.S. Holder\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity or\narrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nEffect of the Merger\nA non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of merger consideration in exchange for\nshares of our common stock in the Merger unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an\napplicable income tax treaty, such gain is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base,\nmaintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the\ndisposition of shares of our common stock in the Merger, and certain other requirements are met\u037e or\n78\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nwe are or have been a U.S. real property holding corporation (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the\nshorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held shares of our common stock (the\n\u201crelevant period\u201d) and the non-U.S. holder held (actually or constructively) more than 5% of the total fair market value of all shares of our\ncommon stock at any time during such five-year period.\nGain described in the first bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular U.S. federal income\ntax rates in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits\ntax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on after-tax profits effectively connected with a U.S.\ntrade or business to the extent that such after-tax profits are not reinvested and maintained in the business.\nA non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as\nmay be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on gain realized upon the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock, which may be\noffset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the\nnon-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests equals or\nexceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. We\nmay be a USRPHC, and if we are a USRPHC, gain arising from the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder generally\nwill not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if our common stock is \u201cregularly traded on an established securities market,\u201d as defined by applicable\nTreasury Regulations, and such non-U.S. holder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our common stock throughout the shorter of the five-\nyear period ending on the date of the sale or other taxable disposition and the non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period. We believe that our Class A common\nstock is currently treated as regularly traded on an established securities market, but we cannot guarantee that our Class A common stock will continue to\nbe treated as regularly traded on an established securities market through the closing of the Merger. If gain on the sale or other taxable disposition of\nshares of our common stock were subject to taxation under the third bullet point above, the non-U.S. holder would be subject to regular U.S. federal\nincome tax with respect to such gain in generally the same manner as a United States person, and the non-U.S. holder would be required to file a U.S. tax\nreturn with respect to such gain. In addition, if shares of our common stock were not regularly traded on an established securities market, the acquirer of\nsuch common stock would generally be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 15% of the purchase price, which withholding would be creditable\nagainst any income tax liability described in the previous sentence and generally refundable to the extent in excess thereof. Non-U.S. holders should\nconsult their advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences that could result from our status as a USRPHC and regarding potentially applicable\nincome tax treaties that may provide for different rules.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made to non-U.S. holders in the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%).\nNon-U.S. holders generally can avoid information reporting and backup withholding by providing the paying agent with an applicable and properly\nexecuted IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, or W-8ECI (or successor form), as the case may be, certifying under penalties of perjury the holder\u2019s non-U.S.\nstatus (and the payor or applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person as\ndefined under the Code) or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under\nan applicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a\nnon-U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\n79\nTable of Contents\nThe discussion above of U.S. federal income tax consequences is not intended to constitute a complete description of all tax consequences relating to the\nMerger. This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax or legal advice. Because individual circumstances may differ, each\nholder should consult their tax advisor regarding the applicability of the rules discussed above to the holder and the particular tax effects to the holder\nof the Merger in light of such holder\u2019s particular circumstances, including the tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules,\nor through the application of any state, local, or foreign tax laws.\nDelisting and Deregistration of Our Class A Common Stock",

However, holders of Class A\ncommon stock do not have such dissenters\u2019 rights.\nShares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any stockholder entitled to demand, and\nwho properly and timely, pursuant to the NMA and a separate notice from the Company, demands payment for such shares under the NMA will be\ntreated in accordance with the NMA. At the Effective Time, all such dissenting shares will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist, and holders\nof dissenting shares will have the right to receive the fair value of the dissenting shares in accordance with the NMA. If any dissenting stockholder loses\nits status as dissenter under the NMA, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the date this status was lost, these shares will be converted into, or will\nhave been deemed to have been converted into at the Effective Time, as applicable, the right to receive merger consideration with respect to that holder\u2019s\nrelated Company Ltd. Common Units.\nAny holder of Class B common stock who wishes to dissent must, before the vote is taken, deliver to Switch a statement of intent with respect to the\nMergers and must not vote, or cause or permit to be voted, any of his or her shares of Class B common stock in favor of the Mergers.\nUnder Nevada Revised Statues, or NRS, 92A.300 to 92A.500, holders of Switch Class B common stock are entitled to assert dissenter\u2019s rights under NRS\n92A.300 to 92A.500. If such a holder properly exercises his or her dissenter\u2019s rights, such Class B common stockholder may demand payment for their\nshares of Class B common stock of its fair value immediately before the corporate action. If Switch and any holder of Class B common stock that properly\nexercises dissenter\u2019s rights cannot agree on a fair value, Switch must then commence an appraisal process in state court to determine the fair value.\nNRS 92A.300 through 92A.500 describe the appraisal process and the procedure holders of Class B common stock must follow to exercise their right to\ndissent and demand payment. The full text of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. All references in NRS 92A.300 to\n92A.500 to a \u201cstockholder\u201d or \u201cdissenter\u201d and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holders of the shares of Switch Class B common\nstock. The following discussion is a summary of the law pertaining to dissenter\u2019s rights under the NRS:\n\u2022\nWhen a corporate action subject to dissenter\u2019s rights is submitted to a vote at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, the corporation must state whether\nor not the stockholders are entitled to assert dissenter\u2019s rights under NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500, along with a copy of that statute\ndescribing these rights. A corporation only needs to notify stockholders of record who are entitled to dissenter\u2019s rights, not all beneficial\nowners.\n\u2022\nIf the corporate action is submitted to a vote at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, any stockholders wishing to dissent must first deliver to the\ncorporation a statement, before the vote is taken, of their intent with respect to the proposed corporate action. Second, a stockholder\nintending to assert dissenter\u2019s rights must not vote any of their shares of the class or series to which dissenter\u2019s rights are available in\nfavor of the proposed action.\n\u2022\nIf the corporation receives requisite stockholder approval for the proposed action, it must then deliver a written dissenter\u2019s notice to all\nstockholders of record who are entitled to assert their dissenter\u2019s rights within 10 days of the effective date of the corporate action. The\ndissenter\u2019s notice must:\n\u2022\nState where the demand for payment must be sent and where and when share certificates, if any, must be deposited\u037e\n\u2022\nInform the holders of shares not represented by certificates the extent to which the transfer of the shares will be restricted after the\ncorporation receives the demand for payment\u037e\n121Table of Contents\n\u2022\nSupply a form for demanding payment that includes the date of the first announcement to the news media or to the stockholders of\nthe terms of the proposed action and requires that the person asserting dissenters\u2019 rights certify whether or not they acquired\nbeneficial ownership of the shares before that date\u037e\n\u2022\nSet a date by which the corporation must receive the demand for payment, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60\ndays after the date the notice is delivered\u037e\n\u2022\nState that the stockholder shall be deemed to have waived the right to demand payment with respect to the shares unless the form is\nreceived by the corporation by the specified date\u037e and\n\u2022\nBe accompanied by a copy of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500.\n\u2022\nHolders of Class B common stock who receive a dissenter\u2019s notice and who wish to continue with the appraisal process must then:\n\u2022\nDemand payment\u037e\n\u2022\nCertify that they were beneficial owners prior to the date specified in the dissenter\u2019s notice\u037e and\n\u2022\nDeposit the stockholder\u2019s certificates, if any, in accordance with the terms of the notice.\n\u2022\nAlternatively, holders of Class B common stock may withdraw from the appraisal process by notifying the corporation in writing by the date\nspecified in the dissenter\u2019s notice. After this date, dissenters may withdraw only with the written consent of the corporation.\n\u2022\nOnce dissenting stockholders deposit the stockholder\u2019s certificates (or, in the case of uncertified shares, makes a demand for payment),\nthey lose all rights as a holder of Class B common stock, unless they later withdraw from the appraisal process. The corporation may restrict\nthe transfer of uncertified shares from the date the corporation receives the dissenters\u2019 demand for payment.\n\u2022\nWithin 30 days of receiving demand for payment, the corporation must pay dissenters an amount the corporation estimates to be the fair\nvalue of the dissenter\u2019s share, plus accrued interest. This payment must be accompanied by:\n\u2022\nThe corporation\u2019s balance sheet as of the end of a fiscal year ending not more than 16 months before the date of payment, a statement\nof income for that year, a statement of changes in the stockholders\u2019 equity for that year or, whether such financial statements are not\nreasonably available, then such reasonably equivalent financial information and the latest available quarterly financial statements, if\nnot reasonably available, then such reasonably equivalent financial information and the latest available quarterly financial statements,\nif any\u037e\n\u2022\nA statement of the corporation\u2019s estimate of the fair value of the shares\u037e and\n\u2022\nA statement of the dissenter\u2019s rights to contest the corporation\u2019s estimate of fair value.\n\u2022\nIf dissenting stockholders wish to contest the corporation\u2019s estimate of fair value, they must notify the corporation in writing within 30 days\nof receiving the corporation\u2019s initial payment. Dissenters must provide their own estimate of fair value plus interest and demand that the\ncorporation pay the difference between this estimate and the corporation\u2019s estimate.\n\u2022\nThe corporation must either pay the additional amount or commence judicial proceedings within 60 days of receiving the demand and\npetition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest.\nA copy of the full text of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500 is included as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of\ndissenters\u2019 rights set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500.

            "text": "HOUSEHOLDING\nThe SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as banks and brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy\nstatements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to\nthose stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost\nsavings for companies.\nA number of banks and brokers with account holders who are our stockholders will be householding our proxy materials. A single copy of the Notice or\nproxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected\nstockholders. Once you have received notice from your bank or broker that it will be householding communications to your address, householding will\ncontinue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would\nprefer to receive a separate copy of the Notice or proxy statement, please notify your bank or broker. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies\nof the Notice or proxy statement and annual report at their address and would like to request householding of their communications should contact their\nbank or broker.\nIf you are a stockholder of record eligible for householding, but you and other stockholders of record with whom you share an address currently receive\nmultiple copies of the Notice or proxy statement, or if you hold stock in more than one account, and in either case you wish to receive only a single copy\nof the Notice or proxy statement for your household, please contact our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (by email:\nhelp@astfinancial.com, or by telephone: 1-800-937-5449). If you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of the Notice or proxy\nstatement and annual report, or if you do not wish to participate in householding and prefer to receive separate copies of the Notice or proxy statement\nand annual report in the future, please contact American Stock Transfer & Trust Company as indicated above.\n124Table of Contents\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION",
