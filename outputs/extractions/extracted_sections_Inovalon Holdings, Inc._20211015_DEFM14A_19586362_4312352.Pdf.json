Under the SEC rules governing \u201cgoing private\u201d transactions, the Rollover Stockholders, including Dr. Dunleavy, through\ncertain Dunleavy Entities, and Cape Capital may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company, and, therefore, required to express their\npurposes and reasons for the Merger to the Public Stockholders.

For further information about the treatment of the Shares, see \u201cSpecial Factors \u2014 Certain Effects of the Merger \u2014\nTreatment of the Shares.\u201d\n\u2022\nTreatment of Equity Compensation Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger:\n\u2022\nEach option to purchase Company Common Stock (a \u201cCompany Option\u201d) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior\nto the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an\namount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price, and the aggregate number of\nshares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option. If the exercise price per share of any Company Option is\nequal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option will automatically terminate and be cancelled\nwithout payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.\n\u2022\nEach award of restricted stock units, with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, that is subject to vesting or forfeiture (a\n\u201cCompany RSU Award\u201d) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated\nand converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger\nConsideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award.\n\u2022\nEach Cash-Out Company RS Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and\nterminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the\nMerger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Cash-Out Company RS\nAward (with any performance-based goals deemed to be achieved at the \u201ctarget\u201d level of performance).

For the purposes of the Merger Agreement and this proxy statement, \u201cConversion Company RS Award\u201d means\nany Company RS Award that is not a Cash-Out Company RS Award.\nAll amounts will be paid less any applicable withholding taxes, and paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time of the\nMerger (and in no case later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation that is at least five (5) Business\nDays following the Effective Time of the Merger).\nFollowing the date of the Merger Agreement, no new offering period will commence under the Inovalon 2015 Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan (the \u201cESPP\u201d), each participant\u2019s outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate\non the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs (if not earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the ESPP)\nand the ESPP will be terminated no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nFor a further description of the treatment of equity compensation awards, See \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2014 Treatment of Equity\nCompensation Awards\u201d and \u201cSpecial Factors \u2014 Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger.\u201d\n\u2022\nIntent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger. Our directors and executive officers have informed us\nthat, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the Shares\n3\nTable of Contents\nowned directly by them in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal and each of the other proposals. As of October 13,\n2021, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was distributed to our stockholders, our directors and executive\nofficers directly owned, in the aggregate, 2,744,001 shares of Company Class A Common Stock and 54,994,740 shares of Company\nClass B Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or collectively approximately 65% of the total voting power entitled to\nvote at the Special Meeting. For a further description of the voting intentions of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers, see\n\u201cSpecial Factors \u2014 Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger\u201d and \u201cInformation about the Special\nMeeting \u2014 Voting Intentions of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers.\u201d\n\u2022\nIntent of Certain Stockholders to Vote in Favor of the Merger. The Dunleavy Entities, who hold approximately 64% of the voting\npower of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock, and Mr. Andr\u00e9 Hoffmann and Cape Capital, who collectively beneficially own\napproximately 23% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock, have separately entered into support agreements\nwith Parent, each dated August 19, 2021, as they may be amended from time to time (the \u201cSupport Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which the\nDunleavy Entities, Mr. Andr\u00e9 Hoffmann and Cape Capital have agreed to vote their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the\nadoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Support Agreement. However, the adoption and approval of the Merger\nAgreement separately requires an affirmative vote of Public Stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding\nshares of Company Common Stock held by the Public Stockholders, which excludes all shares of Company Common Stock held by Dr.\nDunleavy, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital. Copies of the Support Agreements are attached as Annex B to the accompanying proxy\nstatement.\n\u2022\nMaterial US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger. The exchange of the Shares for cash in the Merger will be a taxable\ntransaction to US Holders (as defined below in \u201cSpecial Factors \u2014 Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d)\nfor US federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local and non-US tax laws. A US Holder who solely receives\ncash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,\nbetween the cash received by such holder in the Merger and the adjusted tax basis in the Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.\nStockholders who are Non-US Holders (as defined below in \u201cSpecial Factors \u2014 Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the\nMerger\u201d) will generally not be subject to US federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless such Non-\nUS Holder has certain connections to the United States. However, the tax consequences of the Merger to a stockholder will depend on\nthe stockholder\u2019s particular circumstances, and stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax\nconsequences to them (including the application of any US federal non-income, state, local and non-US tax laws) of the Merger. For\nfurther information about the material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger, see \u201cSpecial Factors \u2014 Material US\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.\u201d\n\u2022\nFinancing of the Merger.

There is no assurance as to the effect of these risks\nand opportunities on the future value of your Shares, including the risk that the market price of Shares may decline to the extent that the current\nmarket price of Shares reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. This chronology does not\npurport to catalogue every conversation of or among members of the Special Committee, the Company Board, the Company\u2019s representatives, Nordic\nCapital X, Nordic Capital X\u2019s representatives and advisors, and other parties. Other than as described below, there have been no material contacts\nbetween the Company and Nordic Capital X in the past two years.\nThe Company Board, together with the Company\u2019s management and with the assistance of the Company\u2019s advisors, has periodically reviewed and\nassessed the Company\u2019s operations, financial performance, competitive position, and growth opportunities in the context of the Company\u2019s long-term\nstrategic goals and plans. The Company Board, together with the Company\u2019s management, regularly reviews potential opportunities to enhance\nstockholder value and considers various strategic alternatives.\nBeginning in September 2019, the Company Board, together with the Company\u2019s management, commenced a detailed strategic review that included\nan assessment of the Company\u2019s operations, financial performance, leverage profile, competitive position, new product innovation opportunities, and\nlong-term plans and an exploration of potential opportunities to further strengthen the Company\u2019s market position and enhance stockholder value,\nincluding various alternatives to help achieve its plans such as raising equity or convertible debt, refinancing existing debt, add-on acquisitions, joint\nventures, collaborations and business combinations. In connection with this strategic review, the Company Board was briefed on contacts from various\npotential strategic partners and the ensuing discussions of potential future opportunities for acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic partnerships, but\nnone of these discussions led to any specific proposals.\nIn connection with this strategic review and as part of the Company Board\u2019s ongoing governance and review practices, the Nominating &\nCorporate Governance Committee of the Company Board sought advice from outside counsel regarding fiduciary duties of directors, appropriate\napproaches to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, as well as specific considerations when a director is a large stockholder, including the\ncircumstances in which it would be prudent to form a special committee of independent directors. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee\nrequested that outside counsel prepare a memorandum summarizing its advice, which was presented and discussed extensively at the regularly-\nscheduled meeting of the Company Board on June 17, 2020.\nOn August 27, 2020, the management presented to the Company Board an overview of the Company\u2019s capital structure, which included a\ndiscussion of potential sources of strategic capital and other methods to support organic and inorganic growth opportunities. The Company Board\ninstructed management to continue its review of sources of strategic capital and strategies for helping the Company to further accelerate and expand the\nachievement of its corporate objectives and mission.\nOn November 11, 2020, a Managing Partner at a private equity firm (referred to as \u201cPE Firm A\u201d) contacted Keith R. Dunleavy, the Company\u2019s\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, via e-mail to inquire about whether the Company would be interested in a potential transaction between PE Firm A\nand the Company. On December 2, 2020, Dr. Dunleavy held a videoconference with representatives of PE Firm A to discuss PE Firm A\u2019s expression of\ninterest. Following this telephone conference, on December 4, 2020, Dr. Dunleavy informed William L. Teuber, Jr., the current lead independent director of\nthe\n21Table of Contents\nCompany Board, of PE Firm A\u2019s indication of interest and informed Mr. Teuber that he would keep him and the Company Board informed of future\ndevelopments with respect to PE Firm A. Following the December 2 discussion, there were no further communications between PE Firm A and the\nCompany, its management or the Company Board until May 2021 (as described below).\nOn February 1, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy was introduced to an Executive Vice President of a large technology company (referred to as \u201cCompany A\u201d) to\ndiscuss future opportunities for strategic partnerships, commercial arrangements or other transactions between Company A and the Company.\nOn February 11, 2021, during a regularly scheduled meeting of the Company Board, Dr. Dunleavy provided an overview of various debt and equity\nfinancings undertaken by peer group companies in the technology and healthcare industries and other strategic transactions announced by such peer\ngroup companies. The members of the Company Board discussed various strategic alternatives with management, including raising additional capital to\nfund acquisitions and research and development via an offering of additional equity or convertible debt or an expansion of the Company\u2019s revolving\ncredit facility, strategic partnerships, and additional strategies for helping the Company accelerate achievement of its corporate objectives and mission.\nDr. Dunleavy also provided an overview of his engagement with PE Firm A and Company A to date (as described above). The independent members of\nthe Company Board then met in executive session. Following this discussion and executive session, the Company Board authorized management to\nengage in discussions with financial advisors who could potentially assist the Company Board with an exploration of various strategic alternatives,\nincluding methods for raising strategic capital. At this time, the Company Board and management were focused on the evaluation of potential capital\nmarkets and debt transactions, but the Company Board nonetheless specifically instructed management to select a financial advisor who would be\ncapable of advising on any and all potential strategic alternative transactions being considered.\nFrom mid-March 2021 to mid-April 2021, Dr. Dunleavy participated in several follow-up conversations with representatives of Company A to further\ndiscuss opportunities for strategic partnerships, commercial arrangements or other transactions between the Company and Company A. On April 14,\n2021, Dr. Dunleavy and five (5) additional members of the Company\u2019s executive and senior management participated in a videoconference with\nrepresentatives of Company A during which the Company and Company A discussed the Company\u2019s data, connectivity, analytical, and broader cloud\nplatform capabilities, as well as potential strategic opportunities for the two companies to partner in the future.\nOn April 20, 2021, Daniel Berglund, a Partner at one of the entities that provides advice and makes recommendations to the investment manager of\nNordic Capital X (collectively, the \u201cNordic Capital Advisors\u201d), arranged for an introduction via email to Dr. Dunleavy.\nOn May 3, 2021, at a meeting of the Company Board, J.P. Morgan presented a preliminary evaluation of the Company\u2019s financial position and\nleverage profile, an assessment of market conditions generally and a preliminary comparison of the Company to other peer group companies. At the\nmeeting J.P. Morgan discussed its views on various potential strategic alternatives, including capital markets transactions, a refinancing of the\nCompany\u2019s revolving credit facility, strategic partnerships, a sale of the Company and additional strategies for helping the Company accelerate and\nachieve its corporate objectives and mission. After extensive discussion, the Company Board concluded that the Company\u2019s management should explore\npotential market interest in an acquisition of the Company before proceeding with any capital markets or debt transactions due to the potentially dilutive\neffect of such transactions on stockholder value. Dr. Dunleavy stated that, should the Company explore a sale, Dr. Dunleavy would only support a\ntransaction as a stockholder in which all stockholders received the same amount and type of consideration. The independent members of the Company\nBoard then met in executive session. Following the presentation and ensuing discussion and executive session, the Company Board authorized the\nengagement of J.P. Morgan in order for J.P. Morgan to pursue a multi-track exploration of: (i) a potential equity offering facilitated by one or more\ninvestment banks, (ii) a potential increase in the Company\u2019s current credit line or revolver or both, and (iii) the initial exploration and assessment of\npotential strategic partnerships that could further accelerate the Company\u2019s achievement of its corporate objectives and mission, as well as a potential\nsale of the Company. J.P. Morgan was selected by management and the Company Board based, in part, on J.P. Morgan\u2019s qualifications, expertise and\nreputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the Company\u2019s industry and its ability to manage a multi-track process that\ninvolved exploration of multiple strategic alternatives in parallel.\nOn May 18, 2021, the Company hosted a virtual investor day in which members of the Company\u2019s management presented a detailed overview of the\nCompany\u2019s vision, growth strategy, markets, cloud-based platform capabilities, and financial information, including earnings guidance for fiscal year 2021.\nMembers of the public were invited to attend the virtual investor day, and a replay of the event, as well as a copy of all presentation materials, were\nposted to the Company\u2019s website following the event.\n22\nTable of Contents\nDuring the period from early May 2021 through July 2021, at the direction of the Company Board and under the oversight of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted over 20 potential counterparties, including PE Firm A and Company A and other potential strategic\ncounterparties and financial sponsors (but not including Nordic Capital X), to gauge their interest in potential transactions with the Company, including a\nsale of the Company. J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company Board and under the oversight of the Company\u2019s management, informed each party\nthat any proposals involving an acquisition of the Company should be structured such that all of the Company\u2019s stockholders receive the same amount\nand type of consideration. The Company entered into 13 confidentiality agreements (all but one of which contained standstills) with interested parties,\nincluding PE Firm A and Company A. Representatives of J.P. Morgan, along with Dr. Dunleavy and Jonathan Boldt, Chief Financial Officer of the\nCompany, participated in management meetings with 13 of the parties that signed confidentiality agreements to provide further information regarding the\nCompany and its financial performance. Among the parties, three large technology companies (including Company A, with the latter two referred to as\n\u201cCompany B\u201d and \u201cCompany C\u201d) conveyed interest in an acquisition or strategic partnership with the Company.\nOn May 26, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy participated in a videoconference with multiple representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors, including Mr.\nBerglund and Fredrik N\u00e4slund, during which they mentioned that Nordic Capital X may be interested in exploring an acquisition of the Company.\nOn June 4, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy received an unsolicited, non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from a\nprivate equity firm (referred to as \u201cPE Firm B\u201d) containing a summary of terms under which PE Firm B would be interested in acquiring the Company. J.P.\nMorgan had not included PE Firm B in their initial outreach to strategic counterparties and financial sponsors, and prior to receiving PE Firm B\u2019s\nindication of interest, neither J.P. Morgan nor the Company had any discussions with PE Firm B regarding strategic transactions or a potential\nacquisitions of the Company. PE Firm B\u2019s letter included a valuation range of $36.00 to $39.00 per share, payable in cash. On the basis of the non-binding\nindication of interest, Dr. Dunleavy instructed J.P. Morgan to invite PE Firm B to execute a confidentiality agreement and commence due diligence on the\nCompany. On June 6, 2021, PE Firm B executed a confidentiality agreement (which contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.\nOn June 8, 2021, J.P. Morgan received a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from PE Firm A.\nPE Firm A\u2019s indication of interest outlined a potential transaction in which the Company\u2019s stockholders would receive $35.00 per share in cash, subject to\nfurther due diligence and negotiations.\nOn June 9, 2021, J.P. Morgan received a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from a private\nequity firm participating in the process based on J.P. Morgan\u2019s original outreach to financial sponsors (referred to as \u201cPE Firm C\u201d). PE Firm C\u2019s indication\nof interest outlined a potential transaction in which the Company\u2019s stockholders would receive $34.00 per share, payable in cash, subject to further due\ndiligence and negotiations.\nOn June 9, 2021, J.P. Morgan received an updated non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from PE Firm B.\nPE Firm B\u2019s letter included a valuation range of $38.00 to $40.00 per share, payable in cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash\nconsideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity.\nOn June 9, 2021, at a meeting of the Company Board, J.P. Morgan presented an update on the Company\u2019s multi-track exploration of: (i) a potential\nequity offering facilitated by one or more investment banks\u037e (ii) a potential increase in the Company\u2019s current credit line or revolver or both\u037e and (iii)\ninterest in a strategic partnership with or acquisition of the Company sought via outreach to various potential acquirers of the Company, including public\ncompanies and private equity firms. J.P. Morgan also presented a preliminary summary of valuation perspectives on the Company, including historical\ntrading data and equity value per share derived from trading multiples, transaction multiples and a discounted cash flow analysis. Representatives of J.P.\nMorgan also provided an update on: (i) the three preliminary, non-binding indications of interest received from PE Firm A, PE Firm B, and PE Firm C,\nrespectively, all of which remained subject to various contingencies, including ongoing diligence of the Company and continued engagement with\nCompany management, and (ii) continuing engagement with several large technology companies (including Company B and Company C).\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan also informed the Company Board that Company A had indicated that it would no longer be participating in the process.\nDr. Dunleavy reiterated his commitment to support potential sale transactions as a stockholder only if all of the Company\u2019s stockholders received the\nsame amount and type of consideration. The independent members of the Company Board then met in executive session. Following the presentation and\nensuing discussion and executive session, the Company Board authorized the engagement of Latham & Watkins LLP (referred to as \u201cLatham &\nWatkins\u201d) as legal counsel to the Company in connection with its exploration of, among other options, a potential equity offering and/or\n23\nTable of Contents\nrefinancing of its revolving credit facility and a potential sale of the Company or strategic partnership with the Company. The Company Board selected\nLatham & Watkins based, in part, on its experience representing companies engaged in a multi-track strategic alternatives review that could involve one\nor more capital markets and M&A transactions.\nOn June 11, 2021, the Company retained Latham & Watkins as legal counsel to the Company.\nOn June 17, 2021, at a meeting of the Company Board, Dr. Dunleavy presented an update on the three preliminary, non-binding indications of\ninterest received from PE Firm A, PE Firm B, and PE Firm C. Dr. Dunleavy informed the Company Board that: (i) PE Firm A had informed J.P. Morgan that it\nwas unwilling to increase the price per share from what was included in its original indication of interest and (ii) PE Firm B was continuing its due\ndiligence review of the Company. Additionally, Dr. Dunleavy informed the board that J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company\u2019s management, and the\nCompany\u2019s management continued to engage with several large companies in the software and technology industries (including Company B and\nCompany C) regarding their potential interest in an acquisition of the Company. The independent members of the Company Board then met in executive\nsession. Following the presentation and ensuing discussion and executive session, the Company Board instructed the Company\u2019s management to\ncontinue its exploration of potential strategic alternatives for the Company.\nDuring the period from mid-June through mid-July 2021, the Company\u2019s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the\nCompany\u2019s management, continued discussions with Company B and Company C. While both companies initially expressed interest in potentially\nacquiring the Company, both later determined that they would instead be interested in participating in the equity financing consortium of other potential\nbidders.\nTo date, J.P. Morgan had not included Nordic Capital X in its outreach to strategic counterparties and financial sponsors. In late June 2021, based\non the preliminary conversation held between Dr. Dunleavy and representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors (as described above), Dr. Dunleavy\ninstructed J.P. Morgan to reach out to Nordic Capital X and invite it to participate in the ongoing strategic alternatives review. On June 24, 2021, Nordic\nCapital X executed a confidentiality agreement (which contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.\nOn July 1, 2021, PE Firm B submitted an updated non-binding indication of interest revising its proposed price to $38.00 per share in cash. At the\ndirection of the Company\u2019s management and based on discussions of the Company Board at the meeting held on June 17, 2021, J.P. Morgan informed PE\nFirm B that it would need to increase its proposed price per share in order to proceed in the process. PE Firm B responded that it would not increase its\nprice, and that representatives of J.P. Morgan should notify it if circumstances change and there was an opportunity to move forward at PE Firm B\u2019s\nproposed price.\nOn July 2, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy met with the CEO of a company in the healthcare industry (referred to as \u201cCompany D\u201d) to discuss the capabilities\nand industry vision of the Company. Based on the initial discussion, the parties agreed to meet again on July 3, 2021. During a follow-up discussion\nbetween Dr. Dunleavy and the CEO of Company D on July 12, 2021, the CEO of Company D expressed an interest in exploring an acquisition of the\nCompany. On July 13, 2021, Company D executed a confidentiality agreement (which contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.\nOn July 5, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy met with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors (including Kristoffer Melinder, Mr. Naslund and Mr.\nBerglund) in person to discuss a potential transaction in which Nordic Capital X would acquire the Company. Detailed terms of the potential transaction\n(including price and structure) were not discussed, but representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors indicated that Nordic Capital X would follow up\nwith a written indication of interest. During the meeting, representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors observed that, in transactions of a similar size and\nassuming an advanced stage of discussions, Nordic Capital X would typically request that members of management participate in a rollover of their\ninvestment. Dr. Dunleavy stated that he could not consider any rollover at this point but he understood Nordic Capital Advisors\u2019 position, and he would\nonly be willing to discuss the matter further if Nordic Capital X\u2019s rollover proposal was supported by the Company Board.\nOn July 6, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy received an unsolicited email from an additional private equity firm (referred to as \u201cPE Firm D\u201d) expressing an interest\nsubmitting an indication of interest in acquiring the Company. Dr. Dunleavy forwarded the email to representatives of J.P. Morgan, who, at the direction of\nthe Company\u2019s management, invited PE Firm D to participate in the sale process. On July 7, 2021, PE Firm D executed a confidentiality agreement (which\ncontained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOn July 12, 2021, J.P. Morgan received a written preliminary, non-binding indication of interest from Nordic Capital X addressed to the Company\nBoard. Nordic Capital X\u2019s indication of interest outlined a potential transaction in which the Company\u2019s stockholders would receive $43.00 per share in\ncash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity. Nordic Capital X\u2019s\nindication of interest expressly stated that it was not contingent on any member of management participating in a rollover of their holdings and also\nexpressly stated that, if the contemplated equity financing for the transaction were to include any material participation by the Company\u2019s significant\nstockholders, then Nordic Capital X\u2019s indication of interest was conditioned on (1) the Company Board forming a special committee of independent\ndirectors to consider Nordic Capital X\u2019s proposal and such special committee making a favorable recommendation to the Company Board and indicated\nthat Nordic Capital X would not move forward with their proposal unless it is recommended by such a special committee, and (2) adoption of the Merger\nAgreement by a fully informed vote of a majority of shareholders who are not affiliated with such significant shareholders. The indication of interest\nrequested that the Company enter into an exclusivity agreement with Nordic Capital X for a period of up to four weeks in order for Nordic Capital X to\ncomplete its due diligence and negotiate a definitive agreement, which request for exclusivity was not granted by the Company or the Company Board.\nOn July 13, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by the Company\u2019s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Latham &\nWatkins to discuss the indication of interest received from Nordic Capital X and the preliminary outreach from PE Firm D. J.P. Morgan advised the Board\nthat PE Firm D indicated verbally that it was prepared to submit a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest in the low $40 per share, payable in cash,\nbut that PE Firm D would require an additional six weeks to complete its due diligence review of the Company. Additionally, J.P. Morgan informed the\nCompany Board that J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company\u2019s management, and the Company\u2019s management continued to seek out and engage\nwith other potential buyers or strategic partners of the Company, including companies in the software and technology industries, and while no other\nparty had submitted an indication of interest in acquiring the Company, certain potential strategic partners (including Company B and Company C)\nsuggested that they would be interested in participating in an equity financing consortium of other potential bidders. The Company Board discussed the\npossibility of requesting that Nordic increase its offer price to $44.00 per share and provide further details on its sources of debt and equity financing in\nexchange for the Company accepting its request for a period of exclusivity. The Company Board also discussed the likelihood that Nordic Capital X may\nrequest that Dr. Dunleavy participate in a rollover of a portion of his shareholding in the Company in light of the Company Board\u2019s understanding of\ntypical market practices for financial sponsors and the statements made during the July 5 meeting between Dr. Dunleavy and representatives of the\nNordic Capital Advisors and in Nordic Capital X\u2019s July 12, 2021 indication of interest with regard to a rollover. After extensive discussions with J.P.\nMorgan and Latham & Watkins, including regarding its fiduciary duties in considering proposals for a possible acquisition or merger and appropriate\napproaches to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest as originally discussed by the Company Board in June 2020 after consultation with\noutside counsel, the Company Board decided to form a special committee of the Company Board in the event that Nordic Capital X proposed transaction\nterms that would include Dr. Dunleavy or any affiliate of the Company receiving different consideration than the Public Stockholders. The Company\nBoard also authorized J.P. Morgan and the Company\u2019s management to continue discussions with Nordic Capital X and propose a price of $44.00 per share\nin exchange for the Company considering entering into an exclusivity agreement. The Company Board instructed Latham & Watkins to prepare a form of\nexclusivity agreement that could be used in the event that the Company Board decided to accommodate Nordic Capital X\u2019s request for exclusivity.\nOn July 14, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted to J.P. Morgan an updated, written non-binding indication of interest addressed to the Company\nBoard outlining a potential transaction in which the Company\u2019s stockholders would receive $44.00 per share in cash, subject to further due diligence,\nwhich cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity, including equity that Nordic Capital X expected to raise from third parties.\nWhile the updated indication of interest did not include any discussion of a potential rollover by members of the Company\u2019s management or the\nCompany\u2019s significant stockholders, the indication of interest again expressly conditioned any rollover structure on (1) the Company Board forming a\nspecial committee to consider Nordic Capital X\u2019s proposal and such special committee making a favorable recommendation to the Company Board, and (2)\nadoption of the Merger Agreement by a fully informed vote of a majority of shareholders who are not affiliated with such shareholders participating in\nsuch rollover (the \u201cApproval Conditions\u201d). The updated indication of interest reiterated Nordic Capital X\u2019s request for a period of exclusive negotiations.\nOn July 14, PE Firm D informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that it would no longer be participating in the process.\nOn July 15, 2021, in response to Nordic Capital X\u2019s updated indication of interest, representatives of J.P. Morgan shared a draft exclusivity\nagreement that was prepared by Latham & Watkins with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors.\nOn July 15, 2021, representatives of Company D participated in a management presentation with Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Boldt to provide information\nregarding the Company and its financial performance.\n25\nTable of Contents\nOn July 16, 2021, representatives from Latham & Watkins participated in a call with representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, outside counsel for the\ninvestment manager of Nordic Capital X (referred to here as \u201cKirkland & Ellis\u201d) in which the parties discussed process matters and due diligence\ninformation. During this call representatives of Latham & Watkins and Kirkland & Ellis discussed the fact that the Company Board was meeting soon to\nconsider and approve the establishment of a special committee and also that they would each expect the special committee would need to evaluate\nwhether the Company should enter into any exclusivity arrangement with Nordic Capital X.\nOn July 18, 2021, the CEO of Company D informed Dr. Dunleavy that Company D would require at least 90 days to complete its due diligence review\nof the Company and was therefore was not able to submit an indication of interest on a timeline that would be competitive with other potential bidders.\nHowever, the CEO of Company D noted that it would be interested in participating in the equity financing consortium of other potential bidders in an\namount up to $500 million, and Company D planned to continue its due diligence review in order to potentially participate in such an investment.\nOn July 18, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by the Company\u2019s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Latham &\nWatkins to discuss and receive an update on discussions with Nordic Capital X and other potential acquirers and strategic partners. Based on\ndiscussions that occurred following the July 13, 2021 meeting of the Company Board, J.P. Morgan indicated that they were increasingly confident that\nNordic Capital X would be able to assemble an equity financing consortium to support a $3.5 billion equity commitment and secure $3 billion of debt\nfinancing commitments that was outlined in its most recent indication of interest. Dr. Dunleavy also noted that Company D had stated it expected to\nparticipate in the equity financing consortium of other potential bidders. While the updated indication of interest did not include any discussion of a\npotential rollover by members of the Company\u2019s management or the Company\u2019s significant stockholders, the Company Board again discussed the\npossibility that Nordic Capital X may request that Dr. Dunleavy participate in a rollover and determined that such a request from Nordic Capital X was\nreasonably likely. Accordingly, representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed with the Company Board its fiduciary duties in considering proposals for a\npossible acquisition or merger, appropriate approaches to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, as well as specific considerations when a\ndirector is a large stockholder. Following extensive discussions with its legal and financial advisors and consistent with its discussions on June 17, 2020\nand July 13, 2021, the independent members of the Company Board unanimously passed resolutions, effective as of July 18, 2021, to form the Special\nCommittee, with Mr. Teuber, William D. Green and Mark A. Pulido as its members. The Company Board determined each member of the Special Committee\nto be unaffiliated with, and otherwise independent from, Dr. Dunleavy and to be otherwise independent and disinterested with respect to the Special\nCommittee\u2019s mandate. The Special Committee was delegated the full power and authority of the Company Board to review, evaluate and negotiate\npotential strategic alternatives, including the power to reject one or more proposals and not engage in any transaction, to retain its own advisors and to\nmake a recommendation to the Company Board regarding any such transaction. The resolution also provided that the Company Board would not\nrecommend any potential transaction to the Company\u2019s stockholders without a prior favorable recommendation by the Special Committee. Dr. Dunleavy\nexpressed his full support for the establishment of the Special Committee while abstaining from the vote itself.\nOn July 20, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of Latham & Watkins to discuss, among other topics,\norganizational matters to facilitate the Special Committee\u2019s work, including the election of Mr. Teuber as its chairman. After discussion and deliberation,\nthe Special Committee approved the selection of Latham & Watkins as legal counsel to the Special Committee. The Special Committee selected Latham &\nWatkins based, in part, on their industry knowledge and experience, experience representing special committees in circumstances similar to that of the\nSpecial Committee and the absence of conflicts of interest with the Company\u2019s management (including Dr. Dunleavy) and Nordic Capital X. The Special\nCommittee determined that, although Latham & Watkins had been retained in June 2021 as counsel to the Company, Latham & Watkins was not the\nCompany\u2019s historic counsel and was independent of Company management and Dr. Dunleavy. Additionally, the Special Committee approved the\nselection of Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP (referred to as \u201cMorris Nichols\u201d) as special Delaware counsel to the Special Committee based, in part,\non their experience with matters of Delaware Law and the absence of conflicts of interest with the Company\u2019s management and potential bidders. The\nSpecial Committee also discussed the various potential financial advisors that the Special Committee would consider for engagement as independent\nfinancial advisors to the Special Committee. After discussing multiple potential financial advisors to the Special Committee, the Special Committee\ndirected Mr. Teuber to work with Latham & Watkins to contact Evercore and another experienced financial advisor with a national reputation to present\ntheir credentials to the Special Committee. The Special Committee also discussed the Company\u2019s efforts through J.P. Morgan to seek out and engage with\npotential strategic and private equity acquirers of the Company, the projections that were prepared by management of the Company and Nordic Capital\nX\u2019s most recent indication of interest. The Special Committee noted Nordic Capital X\u2019s request for a period of exclusive negotiations and the fact that a\ndraft form of exclusivity agreement had previously been shared with Nordic Capital X. The Special Committee determined that it would not authorize the\nCompany\n26\nTable of Contents\nto enter into an exclusivity agreement until Nordic Capital X provided greater clarity on its sources of financing necessary to support the economic terms\noutlined in its indication of interest, including any contemplated rollover by members of management and significant stockholders. The Special Committee\nauthorized Latham & Watkins to contact Kirkland & Ellis to inform them of the decision.\nFollowing the Special Committee meeting, representatives of Latham & Watkins participated in a call with representatives of Kirkland & Ellis in\nwhich Latham & Watkins confirmed to Kirkland & Ellis that the Company Board had formed the Special Committee and that the Special Committee would\nneed to authorize and approve any exclusivity agreement.\nOn July 21, 2021, representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors requested (via J.P. Morgan) that Dr. Dunleavy participate in a rollover of a portion\nof his investment in the Company. On the same date, Dr. Dunleavy informed the Special Committee of this request and indicated that he would be willing\nto consider a potential rollover of some portion of investment in the Company if discussions with Nordic Capital X were to progress favorably and if the\nSpecial Committee was supportive of Nordic Capital X\u2019s indication of interest. Dr. Dunleavy also indicated that be believed that Mr. Andre Hoffmann (a\nholder of Company Class A Shares and a beneficial interest in the Company Class B Shares held by Cape Capital) would be willing to consider a potential\nrollover of some portion of Cape Capital\u2019s investment in the Company. Following deliberations, the Special Committee determined that it was unlikely that\nNordic Capital X would proceed with the acquisition without securing a rollover commitment from Dr. Dunleavy. Accordingly, based on the Special\nCommittee\u2019s understanding that Nordic Capital X would not proceed with a transaction unless Dr. Dunleavy participated in a rollover, the Special\nCommittee authorized Dr. Dunleavy to commence preliminary negotiations with Nordic Capital X regarding a potential rollover of a portion of Dr.\nDunleavy\u2019s and Cape Capital\u2019s investment in the Company.\nOn July 22, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended at various times by representatives of Evercore and another experienced financial\nadvisor to further evaluate each financial advisor\u2019s capabilities. During the portion of the meeting attended by representatives of Evercore, the Special\nCommittee inquired about any material relationships that Evercore may have with the Company or potential counterparties that may impair its\nindependence. Evercore confirmed that it had no material relationships with the Company and committed to delivering a written memorandum\nsummarizing its material relationships with potential counterparties, including Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy. Following the presentations by\nEvercore and the other potential financial advisor, the members of the Special Committee and representatives of Latham & Watkins had further\ndiscussions about the qualifications, experience and independence (including any material relationships with the Company and potential counterparties,\nincluding Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy, disclosed by each financial advisor during the meeting) of each potential financial advisor, and the financial\nanalyses and other actions to be performed by the Special Committee\u2019s financial advisor. After discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee\ndirected Mr. Teuber working with Latham & Watkins to obtain engagement proposals from each potential financial advisor.\nOn July 23, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of Latham & Watkins to discuss the engagement proposals and\npresentations of each potential financial advisor to the Special Committee. After discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee approved the\nselection of Evercore as independent financial advisor to the Special Committee, based in part on Evercore\u2019s qualifications, expertise and reputation, its\nknowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the Company\u2019s industry and take-private transactions generally, its knowledge of the Company\u2019s\nbusiness and affairs. The Special Committee directed Mr. Teuber to communicate the engagement selection to Evercore that day and have them\ncommence work. The Special Committee entered into an engagement letter with Evercore on August 10, 2021.\nOn July 23, 2021, the CEO of Company D called representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors and Dr. Dunleavy to inform each of them that\nCompany D was no longer interested in participating in the equity financing consortium of other bidders and would instead focus on other initiatives.\nOn July 25, 2021, at a meeting of the Special Committee attended by representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins, J.P. Morgan\npresented a detailed preliminary summary of the bidder outreach conducted and indications of interest received to date and the criteria used to seek out\nthese potential bidders. After J.P. Morgan left the meeting, the Special Committee discussed the presentation and its overall assessment of bidder\noutreach extensively with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins.\nIn late July 2021 and August 2021, the Special Committee held a total of 23 meetings with its advisors in which they discussed updates on the sale\nprocess, the due diligence being conducted by Nordic, the Company\u2019s management\u2019s financial forecast, Evercore\u2019s preliminary financial analyses of the\nCompany, the Company\u2019s management\u2019s proposal regarding treatment of equity incentives for employees, and key issues in a draft Merger Agreement\nand ancillary documents. All\n27\nTable of Contents\nmeetings included discussion among the members of the Special Committee with representatives of Latham & Watkins. During these meetings, the\nSpecial Committee again discussed Nordic Capital X\u2019s request for a period of exclusive negotiations and determined that no period of exclusivity would\nbe granted unless Nordic Capital X provided detailed information on sources of financing. Additionally, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed\nthe proposed terms of a Merger Agreement that would be provided to Nordic Capital X. The draft expressly stated that in addition to the stockholder\nvote required by Delaware law, the Special Committee would, consistent with Nordic Capital X\u2019s prior proposals, further require that the majority of Public\nStockholders also approve the transaction. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed that this so-called \u201cmajority of the minority\u201d vote would,\nconsistent with Nordic Capital X\u2019s prior proposals, be a non-waivable condition for the transaction, and that such vote requirement would also be\ncommunicated to Dr. Dunleavy and Cape Capital in the event they agreed to roll over any of their shares of the Company. Additionally, the Special\nCommittee and its advisors discussed various provisions in the Merger Agreement that were designed to maximize value and certainty for the Public\nStockholders, including a \u201cgo shop\u201d that would allow the Company to continue to solicit acquisition proposals following the signing of a definitive\nMerger Agreement.\nDuring this same period, following the discussions with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors that were authorized by the Special\nCommittee on July 21, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy informed the Special Committee that he had originally indicated to Nordic Capital X that, if the Special\nCommittee was supportive of Nordic Capital X\u2019s proposal to acquire the Company, that he would be willing to consider participating in a rollover in an\namount up to $400 million, but representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors had informed him that Nordic Capital X would not be likely to proceed with\na transaction unless Dr. Dunleavy increased the proposed size of his rollover to $700 million. Dr. Dunleavy also informed the Special Committee that Mr.\nHoffmann would be willing to consider coordinating a rollover by Cape Capital in an amount up to $300 million. The Special Committee authorized Dr.\nDunleavy to negotiate with Nordic Capital X about the size of his and Cape Capital\u2019s rollover and to initiate negotiations regarding agreements relating to\nthe rollover arrangements, subject to the Special Committee\u2019s review and approval. Members of the Special Committee also recommended that Dr.\nDunleavy, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital retain independent legal advisors.\nOn July 26, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Boldt to discuss the 2021-2023 financial projections for the\nCompany prepared by management (the \u201cProjections\u201d) and the assumptions underlying such Projections. Also in attendance were representatives of\nLatham & Watkins. Mr. Boldt provided an overview of the models, projections and assumptions included in the Projections and confirmed that such\nProjections were consistent with metrics used in ordinary-course quarterly presentations to the Company Board and the guidance shared with the public\nduring the May 18 2021 virtual investor day. Mr. Boldt also confirmed that the Projections were consistent with the diligence materials shared with Nordic\nCapital X and all other potential bidders and strategic partners. After extensive discussion, the independent members of the Company Board approved\nthe Projections for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore. During this meeting, the members of the Special Committee and\nLatham & Watkins updated the independent directors of the Board who are not on the Special Committee about the analyses and activities undertaken by\nthe Special Committee.\nOn July 26, 2021, the Special Committee with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, discussed the process of evaluating\nalternatives, Nordic Capital X\u2019s due diligence and the projections presented by the Company\u2019s management at the Company Board meeting earlier in the\nday.\nOn July 27, 2021, Bloomberg published an article reporting that Nordic Capital X was in discussions to acquire the Company. In light of the\npreliminary stage of negotiations and the absence of specific details, neither the Company nor Nordic Capital X issued a comment on the Bloomberg\narticle.\nOn July 28, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan transmitted to the Company Board a written memorandum disclosing J.P. Morgan\u2019s material\nrelationships with respect to the Company and Nordic Capital X.\nOn July 29, 2021, representatives of Evercore transmitted to the Special Committee a written memorandum disclosing Evercore\u2019s material\nrelationships with respect to several potential counterparties, including Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy.\nOn July 30, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy informed the Special Committee that he, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital had retained Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP\n(referred to as \u201cMorgan Lewis\u201d) as their legal counsel.\nOn August 1, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Boldt to discuss the 2024-2025 financial extrapolations\nfor the Company prepared by management (based on the previously-approved Projections) and the assumptions underlying such extrapolations. Also in\nattendance were representatives of Latham & Watkins. Mr. Boldt provided an overview of the models, projections and assumptions included in the\nextrapolations.

At the end of the meeting, the Special Committee invited Dr.\nDunleavy to join the meeting to provide his views to the Special Committee regarding the potential treatment of equity incentive compensation in\nconnection with a potential sale transaction.\nOn August 4, 2021, after extensive review by the Special Committee, the Special Committee instructed Latham & Watkins to circulate to Kirkland &\nEllis LLP an initial draft of the Merger Agreement relating to the proposed transaction which contained, among other terms favorable to the Company, a\n\u201cgo shop\u201d provision. Acting on the Special Committee\u2019s instructions, Latham & Watkins circulated the initial draft of the Merger Agreement to Kirkland\n& Ellis.\nOn August 5, 2021, the Special Committee, with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, reviewed the 2024-2030 financial\nextrapolations for the Company prepared by the Company\u2019s management (based on the previously-approved Projections) and the assumptions\nunderlying such extrapolations. After extensive review and discussion, the Special Committee approved the ten-year extrapolations for use in valuation\nanalyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore.\nOn August 6, 2021, independent members of the Company Board with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, reviewed\nthe 2024-2030 financial extrapolations for the Company prepared by the Company\u2019s management (based on the previously-approved Projections) and the\nassumptions underlying such extrapolations. After extensive review and discussion, the independent members of the Company Board approved the ten-\nyear extrapolations for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore (such 2024-2030 financial extrapolations, as approved by the\nSpecial Committee and the independent members of the Company Board for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore, the\n\u201cExtrapolations\u201d). During this meeting the Special Committee also provided an update on the proposal received from Nordic Capital X, Nordic Capital X\u2019s\ndue diligence and financing, and the progress of negotiations of the Merger Agreement and ancillary documents. Latham & Watkins provided an\noverview of the key terms of the Merger Agreement that was previously shared with Kirkland & Ellis to the independent members of the Company Board\nwho are not on the Special Committee.\nOn August 10, 2021, Kirkland & Ellis circulated to Latham & Watkins a revised draft of the Merger Agreement which removed the \u201cgo shop\u201d\nprovision, proposed a Company Termination Fee representing 3.5% of the Company\u2019s equity value and revised other key terms. Kirkland & Ellis also\ncirculated to Latham & Watkins initial drafts of the Debt Commitment Letter, Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee.\nOn August 10, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in which representatives\nof Evercore reviewed its preliminary financial analysis.\nOn the evening of August 10, 2021, representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors verbally informed J.P. Morgan that Nordic Capital X was unable\nto assemble an equity financing consortium at a price of $44.00 per share and accordingly Nordic Capital X would be unable to proceed with the proposed\ntransaction on the economic terms previously outlined in its non-binding indication of interest. Representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors stated\nthat Nordic Capital X planned to send an updated indication of interest that would outline a potential transaction in which the Company\u2019s stockholders\nwould receive $40.50 per share in cash, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity. Representatives of the Nordic\nCapital Advisors also informed J.P.

Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins to discuss\nthe update provided by representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors. The Special Committee instructed the representatives of J.P. Morgan and\nEvercore to reach out to a specified list of other potential buyers and strategic partners, in addition to those that had been contacted previously, to\nassess whether another party would be willing to offer a price that exceeded Nordic Capital X\u2019s updated proposal. The Special Committee also instructed\nassess whether another party would be willing to offer a price that exceeded Nordic Capital X\u2019s updated proposal. The Special Committee also instructed\nthe representatives of J.P. Morgan and Evercore to re-solicit interest of the strategic and private equity bidders who had previously shown\n29\nTable of Contents\ninterest in exploring a transaction with the Company, including PE Firm B. The Special Committee also instructed the representatives of J.P. Morgan to\ninform Nordic Capital X that a price of $40.50 was inadequate and that the Special Committee would not approve any transaction in which Dr. Dunleavy\nrolled over more than the $700 million contemplated in connection with Nordic Capital X\u2019s prior proposal, as the Special Committee viewed any\ntransaction that included a lower price and an increased investment by Dr. Dunleavy as problematic. The Special Committee also instructed J.P. Morgan\nand Latham & Watkins to discontinue Merger Agreement negotiations with Nordic Capital X until Nordic Capital X submitted a revised indication of\ninterest in writing with terms the Special Committee believed it could approve, including a detailed sources and uses table outlining the debt and equity\nfinancing for a transaction.\nOn August 11, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted an updated non-binding written indication of interest outlining a potential transaction in which the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders would receive $40.25 per share in cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash consideration would be\nfinanced with a mixture of debt and equity, including a combined rollover amount by Dr. Dunleavy and Cape Capital of $1.1 billion. Nordic Capital X\u2019s\nupdated indication of interest reiterated that given the rollover Nordic Capital X was requiring from Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Hoffmann, that Nordic Capital\nX\u2019s non-binding offer (and any subsequent offer) would be conditioned on the satisfaction of the Approval Conditions and that the Approval\nConditions would not be waivable. Based on prior instructions from the Special Committee, J.P. Morgan informed representatives of the Nordic Capital\nAdvisors that this proposal was unacceptable and that the Special Committee would not consider any further proposal from Nordic Capital X unless it\nincluded a higher price per share and Dr. Dunleavy\u2019s proposed rollover would not exceed the previously contemplated $700 million.\nBetween August 11, 2021 and August 13, 2021, J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company\u2019s management, engaged in discussions with\nrepresentatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors regarding revised economic terms for a potential transaction. As instructed by the Special Committee,\nrepresentatives of Evercore and J.P. Morgan also reached out to 10 potential counterparties, including PE Firm B and Company D as well as other\nstrategic counterparties and financial sponsors, to gauge their interest in a potential acquisition of the Company at a price at or above $41.00 per share.\nOn August 13, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted an updated non-binding written indication of interest outlining a potential transaction in which the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders would receive $41.00 per share in cash, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity, including\na rollover by Dr. Dunleavy of $700 million and Cape Capital of $300 million.\nThe Special Committee held a meeting on August 13, 2021 with representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins to discuss, among\nother items, an update on J.P. Morgan\u2019s discussions with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors and Nordic Capital X\u2019s revised economic terms\nfor the transaction. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Evercore also provided an update on their outreach to other potential counterparties that may be\ninterested in an acquisition of the Company. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Evercore reported that certain potential counterparties declined to\nparticipate further in a sale process, other potential counterparties responded with varying degrees of interest, but no potential counterparty had\nexpressed an interest in offering a price at or above $41.00 per share. As a result, the Special Committee authorized J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins to\nresume discussions with Nordic Capital X and Kirkland & Ellis regarding the terms of a potential transaction on the revised economic terms proposed in\nNordic Capital X\u2019s August 13 indication of interest.\nOn August 15, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted an updated non-binding indication of interest that provided greater detail on its sources of debt\nand equity financing for the transaction, including a rollover by Dr. Dunleavy of $700 million (consistent with the amount that Nordic Capital X had\npreviously indicated was required in order for them to proceed with the transaction and the amount that the Special Committee had previously supported)\nand an increased rollover by Cape Capital to $600 million (which increase was determined by the Special Committee at a subsequent meeting to be\nnecessary in order to finance all required payments in connection with the transaction). Nordic Capital X\u2019s updated indication of interest included the\nApproval Conditions.\nThe Special Committee held a meeting on August 16, 2021 with representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins to discuss, among\nother items, the status of the communications with other parties who may be interested in a transaction with the Company at price at or above $41.00 per\nshare, the ongoing negotiations with Nordic Capital X and the open issues in the draft Merger Agreement. Representatives of Latham & Watkins stated\nthat, after extensive negotiations, the remaining material open issues in the Merger Agreement included: (i) whether a \u201cgo shop\u201d provision allowing the\nCompany to continue to solicit acquisition proposals following the signing of a definitive Merger Agreement would be included, (ii) the relative sizes of\nthe Company Termination Fee and Parent Termination Fees, and (iii) the date on which the parties could terminate the Merger Agreement if the closing\nconditions have not been satisfied at such time (other than as a result of breach by a party). Latham & Watkins explained that Kirkland & Ellis had\ninformed them that Nordic Capital X\n30\nTable of Contents\nwould be unwilling to proceed with any transaction that included a \u201cgo shop\u201d provision in the Merger Agreement. After extensive discussions, and\nnoting: (1) the extensive bidder outreach activity by J.P. Morgan and Evercore since May 2021 (including outreach to over 30 potential bidders, 14 of\nwhich signed confidentiality agreements and commenced due diligence), (2) the Bloomberg article published almost three weeks earlier, (3) the fact that\nthe Company had not granted exclusivity to any potential bidder, (4) the fact that no other potential bidder had offered to acquire the Company at a price\nat or in excess of $41.00 per share, (5) Nordic Capital X\u2019s willingness to reduce the size of the Company Termination Fee to an amount representing to\n2.75% of the Company\u2019s equity value, (6) the high degree of deal certainty reflected in the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the size of the Parent\nTermination Fee, the Equity Commitment Letter, Debt Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee, and (7) the fact that Nordic Capital X was unwilling to\nproceed with any transaction that included a \u201cgo shop\u201d provision, the Special Committee determined that it would be reasonable to accept the removal of\nthe \u201cgo shop\u201d provision in exchange for Nordic Capital X agreeing to a smaller Company Termination Fee, a longer Merger Agreement termination date\nand other Company-favorable terms in the Merger Agreement. The Special Committee instructed Latham & Watkins to continue to negotiate the terms of\nthe Merger Agreement and finalize all ancillary documents.\nBetween August 16, 2021 and August 18, 2021, the Special Committee and Nordic Capital X through their respective legal advisors continued to\nengage in ongoing negotiations of various definitive transaction documents, including the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited\nGuarantee, and various ancillary agreements.\nThe Company Board held a meeting on the afternoon of August 17, 2021, at which time it reviewed with the Company\u2019s management, together with\nthe Company\u2019s and the Special Committee\u2019s legal and financial advisors, a status update on negotiations of the definitive transaction.

Representatives of Evercore delivered to the Special Committee its opinion, subsequently confirmed by\ndelivery of a written opinion that, based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions set forth in its opinion, as of\nAugust 18, 2021, the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the Public Stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to the Public Stockholders. After discussing the final terms of the Merger Agreement, the Special Committee ultimately unanimously recommended\nthat the Company Board approve the execution by the Company of definitive transaction documents and recommend that the Company\u2019s stockholders\nvote to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nThe Company Board met again on the evening of August 18, 2021, at which time the Special Committee conveyed its recommendation that the\nCompany Board approve the execution by the Company of definitive transaction documents and recommend that the Company\u2019s stockholders vote to\nadopt the Merger Agreement.

Morgan in\npreparing its opinion, as of August 18, 2021, the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the Public Stockholders in the Merger was\nfair, from a financial point of view, to the Public Stockholders.\n31\nTable of Contents\nAfter discussing potential reasons for and against the proposed merger described below and in the section entitled \u201cPurpose and Reasons of the\nCompany for the Merger,\u201d the independent members of Company Board (consisting of all members of the Company Board other than Dr. Dunleavy, who\nrecused himself) unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement with affiliates of Nordic Capital X, the Merger and all of the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e declared that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that the Company enter\ninto the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger and all of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e and recommended that\nstockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger and the Merger Agreement.\nAt the same meeting, the members of the Audit Committee of the Company Board unanimously approved, consistent with the Company\u2019s Audit\nCommittee Charter and applicable NASDAQ listing rules, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby as a proposed transaction\nbetween the Company and a related party.\nOn August 19, 2021, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties thereto executed the Merger Agreement.

the alternatives reasonably available to the\nCompany and the risk of execution, as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks (as more fully described under\n\u201cSpecial Factors

evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and making the decisions, determinations\nand recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) also considered,\namong other things, certain countervailing factors, including the following uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors, which are not\nintended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of importance:\n\u2022\nthat, following the completion of the Merger, the Company will no longer exist as an independent public company and that the\nconsummation of the Merger and receipt of the Merger Consideration, while providing relative certainty of value, will not allow the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders (other than the Rollover Stockholders) to participate in potential further growth in the Company\u2019s assets, future\nearnings growth, future appreciation in value

required to pay Parent a Company Termination Fee of $176,385,000 and expense reimbursement of\nup to $10,000,000 in cash under certain circumstances, including upon termination of the Merger Agreement

and certain enforcement expenses in cash payable by Parent to the Company,\ntogether with other specified amounts, may be the Company\u2019s sole and exclusive remedy in the event that the Merger Agreement is\nterminated by the Company due to (a) Parent\u2019s breach of, or failure to perform its representations, warranties or obligations under the\nMerger Agreement or (b) Parent\u2019s

Superior\nProposal, the Rollover Stockholders have not agreed to vote their Shares in favor of such Superior Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe understanding that the Rollover Stockholders, their affiliates and various executive officers and directors have certain interests in the\nMerger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders generally (as discussed under \u201cSpecial\nFactors \u2014 Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe restrictions placed on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business prior to the completion of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement, which could delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would\notherwise take with respect to the operations of the Company absent the pending completion of the Merger.\nThe Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) concluded that, overall, the potentially positive\nfactors outweighed the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding the Merger. Accordingly, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) determined that the\nMerger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and\nthe Company\u2019s stockholders.\nIn the course of evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and making the decisions,\ndeterminations and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself)\ndid not consider the liquidation value of the Company because (i) they considered the Company to be a viable, going concern, (ii) they believed that\nliquidation sales generally result in proceeds substantially less than sales of going concerns, (iii) they considered determining a liquidation value to be\nimpracticable given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup of the Company. For the foregoing reasons, the Special Committee and the\nCompany Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) did not consider liquidation value to be a relevant factor. Further, the Special Committee\nand Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) did not consider the Company\u2019s net book value, which is an accounting concept, as\na factor because they believe (i) that net book value is not a material indicator of the value of the Company as a going concern but rather is indicative of\nhistorical costs and (ii) net book value does not take into account the prospects of the Company, market conditions, trends in the industry in which the\nCompany operates or the business risks inherent in that industry. The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused\nhimself) believe that the trading price of the Shares at any given time represents the best available indicator of the Company\u2019s going concern value at that\ntime so long as the trading price at that time is not impacted by speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction. In addition, the Special\nCommittee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) implicitly considered the value of the Company as a going concern by\ntaking into account the value of the Company\u2019s current and anticipated business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects\n39\nTable of Contents\nand other forwardlooking matters, as well as by considering the discounted cash flow analysis presented by J.P. Morgan to the Company Board, as more\nfully described below in the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Opinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 42, and, in the case of\nthe Special Committee, the discounted cash flow analysis presented by Evercore to the Special Committee, as more fully described below in the section\nentitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Opinion of the Special Committee\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 46. The full text of the written opinions of J.P.\nMorgan and Evercore are attached as Annex D and Annex E to this proxy statement, respectively.\nAccordingly, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement\nProposal, to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, at the Special Meeting.\nThe Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) are not aware of any firm offer for a merger, sale of\nall or a substantial part of the Company\u2019s assets, or a purchase of a controlling amount of the Company securities having been received by the Company\nfrom anyone other than a filing person in the two (2) years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThe foregoing discussion is not exhaustive, but is intended to summarize the material information and factors considered by the Special Committee\nand the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) in their consideration of the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger. The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) reached the\ndecision to approve the entry into the Merger Agreement and recommend its adoption by the Company\u2019s stockholders in light of the factors described\nabove and other factors that the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) believed were appropriate. In\nview of the variety of factors and the quality and amount of information considered, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr.\nDunleavy, who recused himself) did not find it practicable to and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered\nin reaching their determinations. In addition, each of the directors of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who\nrecused himself) may have given different weight to different factors. The Special Committee and the Company Board conducted an overall review of the\nfactors described above, including through discussions with the Company\u2019s management and their respective legal and financial advisors, and\nconsidered the factors overall to be favorable to, and to support, their decisions, determinations and recommendations. It should be noted that this\nexplanation of the reasoning of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and certain information\npresented in this section is forward looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement\nConcerning Forward Looking Information.\u201d\nCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information",

In connection with its consideration of the Company\u2019s stand-alone prospects and potential strategic transactions available to the Company,\nmanagement of the Company prepared and provided to the Special Committee, the Company Board, Evercore and J.P. Morgan the Projections and\nExtrapolations. The Special Committee subsequently directed Evercore, and the Company Board subsequently directed J.P. Morgan, to use the\nProjections and Extrapolations in connection with rendering their fairness opinions to the Special Committee and to the Company, respectively and\nperforming their related financial analysis, as described above under the headings \u201c\u2014 Opinion of the Special Committee\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d and \u201c\u2014\nOpinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor.\u201d The summary of the Projections and Extrapolations is included in this proxy statement solely to give the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders access to certain financial projections that were made available to the Special Committee, the Company Board, Evercore and J.P.\nMorgan. The summary of the Projections and Extrapolations may not be appropriate for other purposes and is not being included in this proxy statement\nto influence a Company stockholder\u2019s decision whether to vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger.\nThe Projections and Extrapolations were prepared by our management for internal use. The Projections and Extrapolations were not prepared with a\nview toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with GAAP (as detailed below), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding\nprojections, the use of non-GAAP financial measures or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with\nrespect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of the Company\u2019s management, were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best\navailable estimates and judgments at the time of preparation and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of the Company\u2019s management\u2019s\nknowledge and belief, the reasonable projections of the future financial performance of the Company.\n40Table of Contents\nNeither the Company\u2019s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with\nrespect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such\ninformation or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information. The reports of\nthe Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relate to the Company\u2019s historical\nfinancial information. None of those reports extend to any of the Projections or Extrapolations described below and should not be read to do so.\nThe Projections and Extrapolations, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions\nthat are inherently uncertain and many of which are beyond the control of the Company\u2019s management. Because the Projections and Extrapolations cover\nmultiple years, by their nature, they also become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. A number of important factors with respect to\nthe Company\u2019s business and the industry in which it participates may affect actual results and result in the Projections and Extrapolations not being\nachieved. For a description of some of these factors, the Company\u2019s stockholders are urged to review the Company\u2019s most recent SEC filings as well as\nthe discussion entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements\u201d and other risk factors described in the Company\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. In\naddition, the Projections and Extrapolations may be affected by the Company\u2019s inability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the\napplicable period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of the future performance of the Company or that\nactual results will not differ materially from those presented in the prospective financial information.\nThe inclusion of the Projections and Extrapolations in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Company or any of its\naffiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives considered or considers the Projections and Extrapolations to be necessarily predictive of actual\nfuture events, and the Projections and Extrapolations should not be relied upon as such. Neither the Company nor any of its respective affiliates,\nadvisors, officers, directors or representatives has made or makes any representation to any of the Company\u2019s stockholders or any other person\nregarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the Projections and Extrapolations or can give any\nassurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Projections and Extrapolations, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update or\notherwise revise or reconcile the Projections and Extrapolations to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Projections and Extrapolations were\ngenerated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Projections and Extrapolations\nare shown to be in error. The Company does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the Projections and Extrapolations,\nexcept as otherwise required by law.\nThe Projections and Extrapolations include non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow, which\nwere presented because management believed they could be useful indicators of the Company\u2019s projected future operating performance. The Company\nprepared the Projections and Extrapolations on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a\nsubstitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by the Company may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. As used herein, \u201cGAAP\u201d means generally accepted accounting principles.\nAll financial projections are forward looking statements. These and other forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the\nrisks and uncertainties identified above and the cautionary statements contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, and subsequent quarterly and current reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Please consider carefully the discussion entitled\n\u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Information\u201d elsewhere in the proxy statement.\nIn light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections and Extrapolations, the Company\u2019s stockholders are cautioned\nnot to place undue, if any, reliance on the Projections and Extrapolations.\nThe following is a summary of the Projections and Extrapolations (unaudited):\nManagement\nforecast\nManagement extrapolation\n2021E 2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\n2028E\n2029E\n2030E\nRevenue\n$ 775 $ 902 $1,040 $1,200 $1,385 $1,573 $1,759 $1,935 $2,065 $2,137\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$ 271 $ 330 $ 404 $ 492 $ 594 $ 675 $ 755 $ 830 $ 886 $ 917\nEBIT(2)\n$ 153 $ 210 $ 284 $ 372 $ 474 $ 546 $ 620 $ 692 $ 749 $ 786\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(3)\n$ 124 $ 163 $ 214 $ 264 $ 322 $ 367 $ 411 $ 454 $ 490 $ 514\nAll numbers in millions, except for percentages.\n(1)\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is defined as net income or loss calculated in\naccordance with GAAP, adjusted for the impact of depreciation and amortization, interest income,\n41\nTable of Contents\ninterest expense, other expense, net, provision for income taxes, stock-based compensation, acquisition costs, restructuring expense, tax on equity\nexercises, and other non-comparable items.\n(2)\nEBIT is defined as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for the impact of interest income, interest expense, other\nexpense, net, provision for income taxes, stock-based compensation, acquisition costs, restructuring expense, tax on equity exercises, and other\nnon-comparable items.\n(3)\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, taxes, capital expenditures, and changes in net\nworking capital.

Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger.\nAt the meeting of the Company Board on August 18, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Company Board that, as of such date and\nbased upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in\npreparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public\nStockholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its August 18, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Company Board, dated August 19, 2021,\nthat, as of such date, the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public\nStockholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated August 19, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex D to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company\u2019s public common stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nopinion was addressed to the Company Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger,\nwas directed only to the consideration to be paid in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as\nto the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by Company to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion\nwas approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how\nsuch stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies J.P.\nMorgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies J.P.\nMorgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Class A Common Stock and certain publicly traded\nsecurities of such other companies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the Projections and Extrapolations\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the purposes of\nits opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company and Parent with respect to certain aspects of\nthe Merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the\nCompany, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was\nfurnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any\nsuch information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its\n42Table of Contents\nengagement letter with the Company, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not\nconduct or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of the Company or\nParent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P.\nMorgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses\nor forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also\nassumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will have the tax consequences described in discussions\nwith, and materials furnished to J.P. Morgan by, representatives of the Company, and will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement and\npursuant to the certificate of incorporation. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and Parent in the\nMerger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal,\nregulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all\nmaterial governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse\neffect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.\nThe Projections and Extrapolations furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by the Company\u2019s management, as discussed more fully under \u201cCertain\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d The Company does not publicly disclose internal management Projections and Extrapolations of the\ntype provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis of the proposed Merger, and such Projections and Extrapolations were not\nprepared with a view toward public disclosure. These Projections and Extrapolations were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are\ninherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of the Company\u2019s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and\ncompetitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such Projections and\nExtrapolations. For more information regarding the use of Projections and Extrapolations and other forward-looking statements, please refer to the section\nentitled \u201cCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P.\nMorgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P.\nMorgan does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of\nview, of the consideration to be paid to the Company\u2019s public common stockholders in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion\nas to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or\nother constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no\nopinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any\nclass of such persons relative to the consideration to be paid to the Company\u2019s public common stockholders in the proposed Merger or with respect to\nthe fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which the Company\u2019s common stock will trade at any future\ntime.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the consideration to be paid to the Company\u2019s public common stockholders, were determined\nthrough arm\u2019s length negotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the\nCompany Parent. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Company Board in its evaluation of\nthe proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Company Board or management with respect to the proposed\nMerger or the consideration, including the consideration to be paid to the Company\u2019s public common stockholders.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodologies in rendering its\nopinion to the Company Board on August 18, 2021 and in the financial analysis presented to the Company Board on such date in connection with the\nrendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its opinion\nto the Company Board and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the\nfinancial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the\nfinancial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without\nconsidering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a\nmisleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\n43\nTable of Contents\nPublic Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the Company with similar data for\nselected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to those engaged by the Company.\nThe companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:\n\u2022\nNICE LTD.\n\u2022\nPTC Inc.\n\u2022\nBlack Knight, Inc.\n\u2022\nGoDaddy Inc.\n\u2022\nDatto Holding Corp.\n\u2022\nQualys, Inc.\n\u2022\nMimecast Limited\n\u2022\nOmnicell, Inc.\n\u2022\nR1 RCM Inc.\n\u2022\nHealth Equity, Inc.\nThese companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for\npurposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, were considered in its judgment sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of the Company based on business\nsector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical or directly\ncomparable to the Company and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. The\nanalyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies\ninvolved and other factors that could affect the companies differently than they would affect the Company.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratio of firm value to the Wall Street research analyst\nconsensus estimate of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d). Based on the results of this analysis and\nother factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 18.5x \u2013 24.0x. After applying such range to the\nprojected Adjusted EBITDA for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2022, the analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value\n(rounded to the nearest $0.25) for the common stock of the Company of $34.00 to $45.75, which was compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the\nCompany common stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the closing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the\nimplied per share consideration of $41.00.\nSelected Transaction Multiple Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving businesses\nwhich J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the Company\u2019s business (or aspects thereof) based on J.P. Morgan\u2019s experience and familiarity\nwith the industries in which the Company operates (the \u201cJ.P. Morgan Selected Transactions\u201d). The following transactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as\nrelevant to the evaluation of the proposed Merger:\nAnnouncement Date\nTarget\nAcquiror\nApril 23, 2021\nBlue Yonder Group, Inc.\nPanasonic Corporation\nApril 12, 2021\nNuance Communications, Inc.\nMicrosoft Corporation\nAugust 22, 2019\nCarbon Black, Inc.\nVmWare, Inc.\nJune 12, 2019\nMedidata Solutions, Inc.\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes\nJune 10, 2019\nTableau Software, Inc.\nSalesforce.com, Inc.\nOctober 28, 2018\nRed Hat, Inc.\nInternational business Machines Corporation\nJune 19, 2018\nCotiviti Holdings, Inc.\nVerscend Technologies, Inc.\nJanuary 30, 2018\nCallidus Software Inc.\nSAP SE\nApril 26, 2021\nProofpoint, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nDecember 21, 2020\nRealPage, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nNovember 10, 2020\nPlanview Inc.\nTA Associates\nFebruary 6, 2020\nForescout Technologies, Inc.\nAdvent International\nOctober 14, 2019\nSophos Group plc\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nFebruary 4, 2019\nUltimate Software Group Inc.\nHellman & Friedman LLC\nFebruary 12, 2019\nEllie Mae, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, LLC\nNovember 11, 2018\nApptio, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners\n44\nTable of Contents\nNone of the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. Certain of these transactions may have\ncharacteristics that are materially different from those of the proposed Merger. However, the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions were chosen because\ncertain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily\ninvolve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other\nfactors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each J.P. Morgan Selected Transaction, the multiple of the target company\u2019s firm\nvalue implied in the relevant transaction to the target company\u2019s revenue for the next twelve-month period following announcement (the \u201cNTM\u201d) of the\napplicable transaction (the \u201cFV/NTM Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nBased on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/NTM Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of 7.0x to 11.0x. J.P. Morgan then\napplied such reference range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for the NTM as of August 3, 2021. The analysis indicated a range of implied equity\nvalues per share (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of $32.75 to $54.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the Company\ncommon stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the closing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the implied per\nshare consideration of $41.00.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted\nequity value per share for the Company common stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that the Company is expected to generate\nduring fiscal years 2021E through 2030E based upon the financial Projections and Extrapolations prepared by Company management (as set forth in the\nsection entitled \u201cCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d, which was discussed with, and approved by, the Company Board for use by\nJ.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analyses). J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the end of this period by\napplying perpetual growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.0%, based on guidance provided by the Company\u2019s management and on J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nprofessional judgment and experience, to estimates of the unlevered terminal free cash flows for the Company at the end of fiscal-year 2030E, as provided\nin the Company management Projections and Extrapolations. J.P. Morgan then discounted the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of\nterminal values to present value as of August 3, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.00% to 9.00% for the Company, which range was chosen by J.P.\nMorgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the unlevered free cash flow estimates and\nthe range of terminal values were then adjusted by subtracting net debt and other adjustments for the Company as of August 3, 2021.\nBased on the foregoing, this analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for the Company common\nstock of $34.00 to $51.75, which was compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the Company common stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the\nclosing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the implied per share consideration of $41.00.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data\npresented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary\ndescription. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing\nsummary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the\nanalyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were\nmerely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value\nof the Company. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving\nat its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether\nany individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered\nthe totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of\nthe parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be\nappraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as\ndescribed in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger.\nHowever, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and\n45\nTable of Contents\nbusinesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly\nchosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger. The analyses\nnecessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved\nand other factors that could affect the companies compared to the Company and the transactions compared to the Merger.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their\nsecurities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions\nof listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company\nwith respect to the Merger and deliver an opinion to the Company Board with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience\nand its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the industries in which it operates.\nFor financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Merger, the Company has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an estimated fee of $42 million,\n$3.0 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent and payable\nupon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in\nconnection with its services, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out\nof J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other\nmaterial financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company, Parent, Meritas Group, Inc., which holds\napproximately 30% of the capital stock of the Company, GIC Pte. Ltd., Insight Venture Partners, L.P. or 22C Capital LLC. During the two years preceding\nthe date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had and continue to have commercial or investment banking relationships with\ncertain affiliates of Parent, including Parent\u2019s parent company, Nordic Capital X, as well as certain affiliates of each of GIC Pte. Ltd., Insight Venture\nPartners, L.P. and 22C Capital LLC, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received, or will receive, customary compensation. In addition, J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of certain affiliates of GIC Pte. Ltd. and certain\naffiliates of Insight Venture Partners, L.P., for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its\naffiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. During the two year period preceding delivery of\nits opinion ending on August 18, 2021, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Nordic Capital X were approximately $15.2 million. During the\ntwo year period preceding delivery of its opinion ending on August 18, 2021, J.P. Morgan did not recognize any fees from the Company or Parent. In the\nordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including\nderivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any\ntime hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.",

As part of this engagement, the Special\nCommittee requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the Public\nStockholders. At a meeting of the Special Committee held on August 18, 2021, Evercore rendered to the Special Committee its opinion to the effect that, as\nof August 18, 2021 and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore\u2019s opinion, the\nMerger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the Public Stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public\nStockholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated August 18, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures followed,\nassumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as\nAnnex E to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The Special Committee encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in\nits entirety. Evercore\u2019s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in\nconnection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Special Committee or to any other\npersons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger.\nEvercore\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to\nthe Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger.\n46Table of Contents\nIn connection with rendering its opinion Evercore, among other things:\n(i)\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that Evercore deemed to be relevant,\nincluding publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates\u037e\n(ii)\nreviewed the Projections and Extrapolations prepared and furnished to us by management of the Company, as approved for Evercore\u2019s use\nby the Special Committee\u037e\n(iii)\ndiscussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of the Company, the current financial\ncondition and prospects of the Company, and the Projections and Extrapolations (including their views on the risks and uncertainties of\nachieving the Projections and Extrapolations)\u037e\n(iv)\nreviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of shares of the Company common stock\u037e\n(v)\ncompared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded\ncompanies that Evercore deemed relevant\u037e\n(vi)\ncompared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with the financial terms, to the\nextent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Evercore deemed relevant\u037e\n(vii)\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated August 18, 2021, of the Merger agreement\u037e and\n(viii)\nperformed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore deemed appropriate.\nSet forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with the Special Committee on August 18, 2021 in connection\nwith rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The\norder of the analyses described and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Evercore.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data that existed on or\nbefore August 13, 2021, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nFor purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial conditions, industry sector\nperformance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of the\nCompany. The estimates contained in Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are\nnot necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those\nsuggested by Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not\npurport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and\nthe results derived from, Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nThe following summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the\nanalyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a\ncomplete description of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore\u2019s\nfinancial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such\nanalyses.\nSummary of Evercore\u2019s Financial Analyses\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nEvercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company to calculate the estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, free\ncash flows, defined as Adjusted EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, taxes, capital expenditures, and changes in net working capital. Net\nworking capital is defined as the difference between current assets and current liabilities, that the Company was forecasted to generate during the\nCompany\u2019s fiscal years 2021 through 2030 based on the Projections and Extrapolations. Evercore calculated terminal values for the Company by applying\nperpetuity growth rates of 3.00% to 4.00%, which range was selected based on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal year\nestimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the Company was forecasted to generate based on the Projections and Extrapolations. The cash\nflows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to present value as of August 3, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.00% to 9.00%,\nwhich were based on an estimate of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital.

Based on\nthis range of implied enterprise values, the Company\u2019s estimated net debt (calculated as total debt (including capitalized leases) less cash and cash\nequivalents) as of August 13, 2021, and the number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock, in each case as provided by the Company\u2019s\nmanagement, this analysis indicated ranges of implied equity values per share of Company common stock as set forth below in more detail, compared to\nthe Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share of Company common stock.\nBenchmark\nImplied Equity\nValues Per Share\nLow\nHigh\nLTM Revenue Multiple Range: 7.0x \u2013 11.0x\n$ 26.81\n$ 45.20\nNTM Revenue Multiple Range: 6.0x \u2013 10.0x\n$ 26.80\n$ 48.25\nAlthough none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the selected transactions analysis is directly comparable to the Company and\nnone of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, Evercore selected these transactions because they involve companies or\nbusinesses that Evercore, in its professional judgment and experience, considered generally relevant to the Company for purposes of its financial\nanalyses. In evaluating the selected transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market\nconditions and other factors existing at the time of the selected transactions, and other matters, as well as differences in financial, business and operating\ncharacteristics and other factors relevant to the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of\nthis analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect\nthe relative values of the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions and the multiples derived from the selected transactions.\nMathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the selected transactions.\nOther Factors\nEvercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to its opinion, but were\nreferenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:\nLast 52-Week Trading Range\nEvercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of Company common stock during the twelve month period ended July 26, 2021, the last\ntrading day prior to the public report of a rumored sale of the Company to Nordic Capital X, noting that the low and high closing prices during such\nperiod ranged from $17.56 to $34.47 per share of Company Common Stock, respectively.\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets\nEvercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of Company Common Stock prepared and published by equity\nresearch analysts that were publicly available as of August 13, 2021. These price targets reflect analysts\u2019 estimates of the future public market trading\nprice of the shares of Company common stock at the time the price target was published. As of August 13, 2021, the range of selected equity research\nanalyst price targets per share of Company Common Stock was $23.00 to $45.00. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts\ndo not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares of Company Common Stock and these target prices and the analysts\u2019 earnings\nestimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors affecting the financial performance of the Company and future\ngeneral industry and market conditions.\nPremiums Paid Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, Evercore reviewed 21 selected transactions and announced bids for control of US public targets with an\naggregate transaction value between $1 billion and $15 billion in the healthcare and technology industries since January 1, 2019. Using publicly available\ninformation, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each such\ntransaction exceeded the unaffected market prices per share of the target companies prior to announcement of each transaction.\n51\nTable of Contents\nBased on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a premium range of 20% to 35% (based on the\n25th and 75th percentile of the premiums paid in the selected transactions) to the closing price per share of Company Common Stock of $32.71 as of July\n26, 2021, the last trading day prior to the public report of a rumored sale of the Company to Nordic Capital X. This analysis indicated a range of implied\nequity values per share of Company Common Stock of $39.25 to $44.16, compared to the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share of Company Common\nStock.\nPreliminary Presentations\nIn addition to the presentation and financial analyses, dated August 17, 2021, made to the Special Committee described above in connection with\nits opinion, dated August 18, 2021, a copy of such presentation has been attached as Exhibit (c)(ix) to the Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 filed\nwith the SEC in connection with the Merger, Evercore also delivered preliminary written and oral presentation materials to the Special Committee on\nAugust 10, 2021 and August 16, 2021 (collectively, the \u201cPreliminary Presentation Materials\u201d). A copy of the Preliminary Presentation Materials has been\nattached as Exhibits (c)(vii) and (c)(viii) to the Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger. Information\ncontained in the Preliminary Presentation Materials was substantially similar to the information provided in Evercore\u2019s presentation and financial analyses\nmade to the Special Committee described above in connection with its written opinion. The financial analyses in the Preliminary Presentation Materials\nwere based on market, economic and other conditions as they existed as of the date of such presentation(s) as well as other information that was\navailable at such time. Accordingly, the results of the financial analyses differed due to changes in those conditions. Finally, Evercore continued to refine\nvarious aspects of its financial analyses with respect to the Company over time.\nThe Preliminary Presentation Materials were for discussion purposes only and did not present any findings or make any recommendations or\nconstitute an opinion of Evercore with respect to the fairness of the Merger Consideration or otherwise. The financial analyses performed by Evercore in\nrelation to its opinion dated August 18, 2021 superseded all analyses and information presented in the Preliminary Presentation Materials.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by\nEvercore to the Special Committee. In connection with the review of the Merger by the Special Committee, Evercore performed a variety of financial and\ncomparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible\nto partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without considering the analyses as a\nwhole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore\u2019s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the\nresults of all the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its\nopinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and experience after considering the results of all\nthe analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have\ndeemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or\ncombination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual value of the shares of Company\ncommon stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling the total of the figures shown.\nEvercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Special Committee as to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the Merger Consideration to the Public Stockholders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the\nbusiness or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may\nbe significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore\u2019s\nanalyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those\nforecasted in such estimates.\nEvercore\u2019s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Special Committee (in its capacity as\nsuch) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of Evercore\u2019s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.\nEvercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Special Committee or the Company\u2019s management or that any specific\namount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the Merger for the holders of Company Common Stock.\n52\nTable of Contents\nPursuant to the terms of Evercore\u2019s engagement letter with the Special Committee, the Company has agreed to pay Evercore a retainer fee for its\nservices equal to $3 million which was payable upon execution of Evercore\u2019s engagement letter with the Special Committee. The Company also agreed to\npay Evercore an opinion fee equal to $1 million upon delivery of Evercore\u2019s opinion which is fully creditable against the $3 million retainer fee. The\nEvercore engagement letter also provides for, at the conclusion of the assignment thereunder, an additional discretionary fee in an amount not to exceed\n$7 million, based upon, among other things, the resources expended by Evercore in the course of the assignment, the Special Committee\u2019s satisfaction\nwith the services rendered and the benefit to the Special Committee of the successful conclusion of the assignment, to be determined by the Special\nCommittee in its sole and absolute discretion. In addition, the Evercore engagement letter provides for additional fees to be paid to Evercore if the Special\nCommittee and Evercore agree to expand the scope of Evercore\u2019s services, which fees shall be mutually agreed between the parties. The Company has\nalso agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses and to indemnify Evercore against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.\nDuring the period January 1, 2019 to August 18, 2021, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other\nservices to the Company and Evercore has not received any compensation from the Company during such period. During the period January 1, 2019 to\nAugust 18, 2021, Evercore and its affiliates have provided financial advisory services to Nordic Capital X and/or certain of its affiliates and received fees\nfor the rendering of these services in the amount of approximately $9 million. During the period January 1, 2019 to August 18, 2021, Evercore and its\naffiliates have provided financial advisory services to GIC and certain of its affiliates and received fees for the rendering of these services in the amount\nof approximately $46 million. During the period January 1, 2019 to August 18, 2021, Evercore and its affiliates have provided financial advisory services to\nInsight and certain of its affiliates and received fees for the rendering of these services in the amount of approximately $57 million. Evercore may provide\nfinancial advisory or other services to the Company and the Acquiror and their respective affiliates, including Nordic Capital X, GIC, Insight and their\nrespective affiliates, in the future, and in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.\nEvercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of customers, including corporate\nfinance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In\nconnection with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which\nany of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or otherwise effect\ntransactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial\ninstruments of or relating to the Company, Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates, including Nordic Capital X, GIC, Insight and their respective\naffiliates, or persons that are competitors, customers or suppliers of the Company, Parent or their respective affiliates, including Nordic Capital X, GIC,\nInsight and their respective affiliates.\nThe Special Committee engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore\u2019s qualifications, experience and reputation. Evercore is an\ninternationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly provides fairness opinions to its clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions,\nleveraged buyouts and valuations for corporate and other purposes.\nPosition of Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger",

Parent and Merger Sub are making the statements included in this section solely for\npurposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. However, the view of Parent and\nMerger Sub as to the fairness of the Merger should not be construed as a recommendation to any Company stockholder as to how that stockholder\nshould vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub have interests in the Merger that are different from, and in addition\nto, those of the other stockholders of the Company.\nParent and Merger Sub did not participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee or the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who\nrecused himself) regarding, nor receive advice from the respective legal or other advisors of the Special Committee or the Company Board (other than Dr.\nDunleavy, who recused himself) as to, the fairness of the Merger. The Parent Entities have not performed, or engaged a financial advisor to perform, any\nvaluation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the Merger to the Public Stockholder. Based on, among other things, the factors\nconsidered by, and the analysis and resulting conclusions of, the Company Board (other than Mr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and the Special\nCommittee discussed in \u201cSpecial Factors \u2014 Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Company Board and the\nSpecial Committee\u037e Fairness of the Merger\u201d (which analysis and resulting\n53Table of Contents\nconclusions Parent and Merger Sub adopt), Parent and Merger Sub believe that the Merger is substantively fair to the Public Stockholders. In particular,\nthe Parent Entities considered the following:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) unanimously determined that\nthe Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of,\nthe Company and the Company\u2019s stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that no member of the Company\u2019s senior management other than Dr. Dunleavy has a substantial financial interest in the Merger that\nis different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Public Stockholders generally, although the Merger Agreement does include\ncustomary provisions for indemnity and the continuation of liability insurance for the Company\u2019s officers and directors\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, thus allowing the Company\u2019s stockholders to immediately realize a certain and fair value\nfor their Shares, which value represents a significant premium over the closing price of the Shares on July 26, 2021, the last trading day prior\nto the public report of a rumored sale of the Company to Nordic Capital X\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger will provide liquidity for the Public Stockholders without the delays that would otherwise be necessary in order to\nliquidate the positions of larger holders, and without incurring brokerage and other costs typically associated with market sales\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger is not conditioned on any financing being obtained by Parent, increasing the likelihood that the Merger will be\nconsummated and that the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the Merger will be received.\nThe Parent Entities further believe that the Merger is procedurally fair to the Public Stockholders based upon, among other things, the following\nfactors:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Special Committee retained, and had the benefit of advice from, nationally recognized legal and financial advisors\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the Special Committee had the authority to reject any proposals made by Parent or any other person\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration was the result of the Special Committee\u2019s extensive arm\u2019s-length negotiations with Parent\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the closing of the Merger is conditioned on the Company\u2019s receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to provide information to, or participate in\ndiscussions or negotiations with, third parties regarding Acquisition Proposals that constitute Superior Proposals\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a\ndefinitive agreement related to a Superior Proposal, subject to paying Parent a Company Termination Fee of $176,385,000 in cash, subject to\nand in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe availability of appraisal rights to the Company\u2019s stockholders (other than the Rollover Stockholders) who comply with all of the required\nprocedures under Delaware law for exercising appraisal rights, which allow such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their Shares.\nThe Parent Entities also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the substantive and procedural fairness of the\nproposed Merger, including:\n\u2022\nthat the stockholders of the Company (other than the Rollover Stockholders) will not participate in any future earnings, appreciation in\nvalue or growth of the Company\u2019s business and will not benefit from any potential sale of the Company or its assets to a third party in the\nfuture\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all\u037e\n\u2022\nthat Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed corporations with essentially no assets other than the equity and funding commitments of the\nEquity Investors

The Rollover Stockholders and their affiliates are making the statements in this section solely for the\npurposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act. The Rollover Stockholders do not make any\nrecommendations as to how stockholders of the Company should vote their Shares relating to the Merger.\nDr. Dunleavy has served as the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer since his organization of the company\u2019s predecessor companies in 1998, as\nChairman of the Company Board since the creation of the board in 2006, and as President from the Company\u2019s foundation until May of 2014. The Rollover\nStockholders considered favorable current market conditions, and\n56Table of Contents\nconcluded that a take-private transaction that would provide fair value to all of the Company\u2019s stockholders, including the Public Stockholders, could be\nattractive. Dr. Dunleavy indicated to the Company Board prior to the establishment of the Special Committee that he would only support a transaction as\na stockholder in which he received the same consideration as the Public Stockholders in respect of all Company Common Stock held by him. However,\nfollowing the establishment of the Special Committee, representatives of Nordic Capital Advisors indicated they were not prepared to move forward with\na proposed transaction without a significant rollover of existing Company Common Stock. As a result, the Rollover Stockholders eventually agreed to\nenter into the Rollover Agreements because they believed that the overall benefits of the Merger outweighed the detriments to them associated with the\nRollover Agreements, including the lack of liquidity the Rollover Stockholders will have in the equity of Parent, the control of Parent by affiliates of\nNordic Capital X, and the increased risk associated with the leverage contemplated for the Company after closing. In determining to enter into the\nRollover Agreements, the Rollover Stockholders also considered the confidence they have in the existing management team and in the prospects of the\nCompany and in the track record of Nordic Capital Advisors to operate acquired companies.\nThe Rollover Stockholders believe that it is in the best interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders to effect a liquidity transaction while market\nconditions remain favorable, as well as in the best interests of the Company to operate as a privately held entity. The Rollover Stockholders believe that,\nas a privately held entity, the Company will have greater operational flexibility to pursue alternatives than it would have as a public company, and\nmanagement of the Company will be able to concentrate on long-term growth, reducing the focus on the quarter-to-quarter performance often emphasized\nby the public equity market\u2019s valuation of the Shares. Although the Rollover Stockholders believe that there may be substantial opportunities associated\nwith their contribution to Ocala Topco, LP of the Rollover Shares, the Rollover Stockholders recognize that there may also be substantial risks (including\nthe risks and uncertainties relating to the prospects of the Company) and that such opportunities may not ever be fully realized.\nIf the Merger is completed, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the Shares will cease to be publicly traded. For the\nRollover Stockholders, the purpose of the Merger is to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the separate Rollover\nAgreements, which will allow the Rollover Stockholders to realize the value of a portion of their Shares by receiving $41.00 per Share in cash for a portion\nof their investment in the Company and own equity interests of Parent and to bear the rewards and risks of such ownership after the Merger is completed\nand the Shares cease to be publicly traded. The Rollover Stockholders believe that structuring the transaction in such a manner is preferable to other\nalternative transaction structures because (i) it will enable Parent to acquire all of the outstanding Shares of the Company at the same time\u037e (ii) it\nrepresents an opportunity for the Public Stockholders to immediately realize the value of their investment in the Company and for the Rollover\nStockholders to immediately realize the value of a significant portion of their investment in the Company at a price of $41.00 per Share in cash, without\ninterest, less any applicable withholding taxes, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e and (iii) it\nallows the Rollover Stockholders to continue to own indirect equity interests in the Company after the Merger and to bear the rewards and risks of such\nownership after the Merger.\nPlans for the Company After the Merger",

The calculations in the table below do not include any\namounts that the named executive officers were entitled to receive or that were vested as of the date hereof. In addition, these amounts do not attempt to\nforecast any additional awards, grants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, or any awards that, by their terms, vest\nirrespective of the Merger prior to October 7, 2021. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the\nrelevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer\nmay differ materially from the amounts set forth below.\nFor an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would become payable under the Change in Control Policy to the\nnamed executive officers, see \u201cSpecial Factors \u2014 Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger \u2014 Golden Parachute\nCompensation\u201d below.\nIndemnification Benefits\nEach of the Company\u2019s executive officers and directors is entitled to the indemnification benefits in favor of the Company\u2019s directors and executive\nofficers, as described in more detail in \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2014 Indemnification\u037e Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Insurance.\u201d\n61\nTable of Contents\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nName of Named Executive Officer\nCash ($)\n(1)\nEquity ($)\n(2)\nPerquisites/\nBenefits\n($)\nTax\nReimbursement\n($)\nOther\n($)\nTotal ($)\nKeith R.

The Company entered into an employment agreement with Robert Wychulis on December 3, 2014, Jason Capitel on January 23, 2018 and\nPeter De Bock on January 12, 2019, and a promotion letter with Jonathan Boldt on January 14, 2019 (such employment agreements, collectively, the\n\u201cEmployment Agreements\u201d). If we terminate the employment of a named executive officer other than for \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in their Employment\nAgreements), subject to the named executive officer\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of us, we will provide him with a\nlump-sum cash severance benefit equal to the greater of (i) one month\u2019s base salary or (ii) one month\u2019s base salary per each full year of his service\nwith us, subject to a maximum of six months\u2019 base salary. However, as a condition of agreeing to changes to the vesting of outstanding equity\nawards, including the treatment of Company RS Awards as Cash-Out Company RS Awards, each named executive officer agreed that any amounts\nthat would have been payable under the Employment Agreements prior to the closing date will reduce the amount payable in respect of the Cash-\nOut Company RS Awards that are single-trigger payments as described below. If a named executive officer\u2019s employment is terminated without\n\u201ccause\u201d on the closing date, the full amount of the Cash-Out Company RS Award would be payable and no severance would be owed. On October\n4, 2021 Jason B. Capitel\u2019s and Peter De Bock\u2019s employment ended. Amounts in this column will be paid subject to each\u2019s execution of the\nCompany\u2019s standard form of separation and release agreement.\nIn addition, each participant in our 2021 annual bonus program, including our named executive officers, would be entitled to his or her 2021 annual\nbonus if and when annual bonuses are paid under the 2021 annual bonus program and the participant is eligible and an employee as of the 2021\nannual bonus payment. These amounts would represent double trigger payments, which would be payable as a result of the occurrence of both the\nconsummation of the Merger and the relevant individual experiencing a qualifying termination of employment. The target bonus opportunities for\nthe 2021 annual bonus program for each of our named executive officers are: Dr. Dunleavy, $0, and Mr. Boldt, $281,250.\n(2)\nEquity. These amounts represent single-trigger payments that will occur solely as a result of the consummation of the Merger. Based on the Merger\nAgreement, unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable securityholder in writing (i) each Company Option that is outstanding and\nunexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash\npayment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price, and the aggregate number of\nshares of Inovalon common stock subject to such Company Option, less any applicable withholding taxes\u037e and (ii) each Cash-Out Company RS\nAward that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to\nreceive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of\nInovalon common stock subject to the Cash-Out Company RS Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be achieved at the \u201ctarget\u201d\nlevel of performance), less any applicable withholding taxes. Amounts for Messrs Jason B. Capitel and Peter De Bock take into account the\nreduction from the cash severance benefit in connection with each\u2019s separation from employment on October 4, 2021. Set forth above in the Section\n\u201cInterests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company \u2014 Payments to Executive Officers in Respect of Equity Awards\u201d are the values of\neach type of unvested Company equity award held by each named executive officer as of the date of this proxy statement that would become\nvested upon the consummation of the Merger based on an assumed effective time of October 7, 2021.\n(3)\nEffective December 31, 2020, Mr. Wychulis formally transitioned his role from President to a new position as Fellow of the Company\u2019s Payer\nBusiness Unit.\n(4)\nOn October 4, 2021, Jason B.

Any such\npartnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes), and any partners thereof, that hold the\nShares should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of exchanging the Shares pursuant to the Merger. In addition, holders of\nShares who are not US Holders may be subject to different tax consequences than those described below, and are urged to consult their tax advisors\nregarding their tax treatment under US and non-US tax laws.\nThe following summary is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. Holders of Shares\nare urged to consult their own tax advisor with respect to the specific tax consequences to them of the Merger in light of their own particular\ncircumstances, including US federal estate, gift and other non-income tax consequences, and tax consequences under state, local and non-US tax laws.\nUS Holders\nThe following is a summary of the material US federal income tax consequences of the Merger that will apply to US Holders. For purposes of this\ndiscussion, the term US Holder refers to a beneficial owner of the Shares that is, for US federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident in the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation (or any other entity or arrangement treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or\nunder the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US\npersons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) the trust has validly elected to be treated as a \u201cUnited\nStates person\u201d under applicable Treasury regulations.\nExchange of the Shares for Cash Pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The exchange of the Shares by a US Holder for cash in the Merger (or for\ncash upon exercise of appraisal rights) will generally be a taxable transaction for US federal income tax purposes. A US Holder will generally recognize\ngain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received in the Merger (or cash received upon exercise of appraisal rights) and the\nholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the Shares exchanged therefor. Gain or loss will generally be determined separately for each block of the Shares (generally,\nthe Shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) held by such US Holder. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be\nlong-term capital gain or loss if such US Holder\u2019s holding period for the Shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the exchange. Long-term capital\ngains recognized by a non-corporate US Holder are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain\nlimitations.\n64\nTable of Contents\nNon-US Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-US Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of Shares that is neither a US Holder nor an entity or arrangement\nclassified as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes.\nA Non-US Holder generally will not be subject to US federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for Shares pursuant\nto the Merger, unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with the Non-US Holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an\napplicable income tax treaty, such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-US Holder in the United States)\u037e\nor\n\u2022\nthe Non-US Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the\ndisposition of Shares pursuant to the Merger, and certain other requirements are met.\nGain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to US federal income tax on a net income basis at generally applicable US\nfederal income tax rates in the same manner as if such Non-US Holder were a US Holder. A Non-US Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a\nbranch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or lower rate specified in an applicable income tax treaty, on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain\nitems.\nGain described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to US federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be\nspecified under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by US-source capital losses of the Non-US Holder (even though the individual is\nnot considered a resident of the United States), provided the Non-US Holder has timely filed US federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax\nProceeds from the exchange of the Shares pursuant to the Merger (or as a result of exercising appraisal rights) generally will be subject to\ninformation reporting. In addition, backup withholding tax at the applicable rate (currently 24%) generally will apply unless the applicable US Holder or\nother payee provides a valid taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures (generally, by providing a properly\ncompleted IRS Form W-9), or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding tax. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts\nwithheld under the backup withholding tax rules from a payment to a US Holder will be allowed as a credit against that holder\u2019s US federal income tax\nliability, and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided, that, the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Each US Holder should duly\ncomplete, sign and deliver to the exchange agent an appropriate IRS Form W-9 to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup\nwithholding tax, unless an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the exchange agent.\nA Non-US Holder generally certifies its status as such by providing a properly completed and signed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-BEN-E (or other\napplicable IRS Form W-8). A Non-US Holder that does not provide such form generally will be presumed to be a US Holder, subject to backup\nwithholding tax as described above.\nFinancing of the Merger",

Inovalon Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-05665\n(the \u201cClaybrook Complaint\u201d). The Clasby Complaint, Silverberg Complaint, Ciccotelli Complaint, and Claybrook Complaint collectively constitute\nthe \u201cComplaints.\u201d The Complaints allege that the Company\u2019s Schedule 14A filed September 17, 2021 (or October 8, 2021 in the case of the Claybrook\nComplaint) omits material information with respect to the Merger and that, as a result all defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. The\nSilverberg Complaint, Ciccotelli Complaint, and Claybrook Complaint also allege that all defendants violated Rule 14A-9 promulgated under the\nExchange Act. The Clasby Complaint, Ciccotelli Complaint, and Claybrook Complaint additionally allege that each member of the Company Board\nviolated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Complaints seek (i) injunctive relief\u037e (ii) rescissory damages\u037e (iii) plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees\nand costs\u037e and (iv) other such relief that the court deems just and proper. The Ciccotelli Complaint, Clasby Complaint, and Claybrook Complaint\nadditionally seek (i) rescission in the event the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are consummated\nand, (ii) in the case of the Ciccotelli Complaint and Clasby Complaint a direction that the Company Board issue a revised Schedule 14A. The Ciccotelli\nComplaint and Claybrook Complaint additionally seek a declaration that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well\nas Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The Company believes the claims asserted in the Complaints are without merit.\nAdditional lawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Company Board or the Company\u2019s officers in connection with the Merger, which could\nprevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to the Company, including any costs associated with indemnification.\nAppraisal Rights",

This means that holders of Shares who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter effectively withdraw their demand for\nappraisal and who follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to have such Shares appraised by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of such Shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount\ndetermined to be fair value, if any, (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cInformation\nabout the Special Meeting \u2014 Appraisal Rights,\u201d on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the\nSurviving Corporation in the Merger to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the\ncomplexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their Shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully\nand to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,\ncould be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not\nseek appraisal of their Shares.\nTo exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is taken on the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) not submit a proxy with respect to, or otherwise vote, the Shares for which you seek appraisal in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) continue to hold such Shares of record on and from the date of the making of the demand through the Effective Time\u037e\nand (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the\nprocedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Company Class A Common Stock, unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the\nstockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Special Meeting \u2014 Appraisal Rights,\u201d which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL\nregarding appraisal rights.

        "Appraisal Rights": {
            "text": "Appraisal Rights\nIf the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold Shares through the Effective Time, who do not vote such Shares in favor of\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of such Shares and who do not effectively withdraw their demands or otherwise\nlose their rights of appraisal, will be entitled to an appraisal of such Shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL (\u201cSection 262\u201d).\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL, and is qualified in its entirety by the full\ntext of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex F, and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. The\nfollowing summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal\nrights under Section 262. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of Shares unless otherwise\nexpressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of Shares is entitled to demand appraisal of such Shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having\na beneficial interest in Shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the\nrecord holder to follow the steps set forth in Section 262 (and summarized below) properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold\nyour Shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, and if you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with such broker, bank or other\nnominee.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, holders of Shares who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is\ntaken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) do not submit a proxy with respect to, or otherwise vote, the Shares for which such holders seek\nappraisal in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) continue to hold such Shares of record on and from the date of the making of the\ndemand through the Effective Time\u037e and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, will\nbe entitled to have such Shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of such Shares, exclusive\nof any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be\nfair value, if any, as determined by the court. The Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings with respect to the Company Class A Common\nStock unless: (a) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock held by stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have\nbecome entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Company Class A Common Stock\u037e or (b) the value of the aggregate per Share\nMerger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Class A Common Stock held by stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who\nhave become entitled to appraisal rights exceeds $1,000,000 (conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the \u201cownership thresholds\u201d). Unless the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the\nEffective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to\ntime during such period. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving\nCorporation may voluntarily pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case,\nsuch interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of the Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash\npayment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of\njudgment.\n107Table of Contents\nUnder Section 262, where a Merger Agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty\n(20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders, who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for\nwhich appraisal rights are available, that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes\nthe Company\u2019s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this\nproxy statement as Annex F, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. In connection with the Merger, any holder of Shares who wishes to\nexercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex F carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the\nrequirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her, its\nor their appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement, without interest thereon.\nMoreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of any Shares, that if a stockholder considers exercising\nsuch rights, that stockholder is encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the summary of\nSection 262 contained herein and Section 262, Section 262 will govern.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to an appraisal of their Shares must do ALL the following:\n\u2022\nNOT vote the Shares for which appraisal is sought in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\ndeliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of such Shares before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting,\nwhich written demand must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder who intends to demand appraisal of his, her,\nits or their Shares, and that such stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of such Shares\u037e\n\u2022\ncontinuously hold such Shares on and from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal\nrights if the stockholder transfers the Shares before the Effective Time)\u037e\n\u2022\nfile a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of such Shares within 120 days after the\nEffective Time. This may be undertaken by the stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of Shares held either in a voting trust\nor by a broker, bank or other nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation is under no\nobligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so\u037e and\n\u2022\notherwise comply fully with the conditions established by Section 262.\nIn addition, with respect to the Company Class A Common Stock, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a\nstockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from\nvoting.\nMaking a Written Demand\nAny holder of Shares wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to the Company, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement\nat the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the\nstockholder\u2019s Shares, and that stockholder must not vote such Shares or submit a proxy for such Shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement. A holder of Shares exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the Shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must\ncontinue to hold the Shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked,\nbe voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any\npreviously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights for such\nstockholder\u2019s Shares must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting, with\nrespect to such Shares. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written\ndemand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of Shares is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the Shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in\nrespect of Shares must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably\n108\nTable of Contents\ninform the Company of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s Shares in connection with\nthe Merger. If the Shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the Shares are owned of record by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in\ncommon, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint\nowners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly\ndisclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A record holder such as a broker, bank or other\nnominee who holds Shares as nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more\nbeneficial owners. In such case, the written demand should set forth the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought, and where no number of\nshares is expressly mentioned it will be presumed to cover all Shares held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds shares through a broker\nwho in turn holds the shares through a central securities depositary nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by\nor on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as the record holder.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES THROUGH A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A\nPERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BROKER, BANK OR\nOTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS\nNECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to the Company at 4321 Collington Road, Bowie, MD\n20716, and may not be submitted by electronic submission. Such written demand must be delivered to and received by the Company before the vote on\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.\nAny holder of Shares who has delivered a written demand to the Company and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her, its or their demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement by delivering to the Company a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made\nmore than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be\nconditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this does not affect the right of any stockholder\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to\naccept the per Share Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.\nIf an appraisal proceeding is commenced and the Company, as the Surviving Corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal\nwhen that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in\nthe immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a\nstockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less\nthan, equal to or more than the per Share Merger Consideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of Shares who has\nproperly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the\nMerger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of Shares who has complied with Section 262\nand is otherwise entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any beneficial owner of the relevant Shares) may commence an\nappraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed\nby a stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of the fair value of the Shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal.\nThe Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not assume that the Surviving\nCorporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the\n109\nTable of Contents\nShares. Accordingly, any holders of Shares who desire to have their Shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights\nin respect of their Shares within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Shares to file such a petition within the\nperiod specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of Shares who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and who is otherwise entitled\nto appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate\nnumber of Shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which the Company has received demands for\nappraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such Shares. The Surviving Corporation must give this statement to the requesting stockholder within\nten (10) days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the\nperiod for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of Shares held either in a voting trust or by a broker, bank or other\nnominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the\nforegoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of Shares and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving\nCorporation will then be obligated, within twenty (20) days after such service, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing\nthe names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their Shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their Shares\nhave not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the\nhearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the written statement described above at the\naddresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation\npublished in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne by the Surviving\nCorporation. After notice to stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to\ndetermine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of\nChancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment for their Shares to submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Register in Chancery for\nnotation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have\nasserted appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nThe appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the Shares, exclusive of\nany element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined\nto be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly\nand will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the\nEffective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal\nproceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after\nthe time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the Shares as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time.\nIn Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal\nproceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and\notherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light\non future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow\nexclusion [that] does not encompass\n110\nTable of Contents\nknown elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In\nWeinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or\nsusceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\ncould be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their Shares\nand that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an\nopinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value\nas determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value\nhigher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither the Company nor Parent anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration\nto any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, the Company reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section\n262 and each of the Company and Parent reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a\nShare is less than the per Share Merger Consideration. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and\nexpenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems\nequitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses\nincurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses\nof experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the Shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party\nbears its own expenses.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her, its or their Shares under Section 262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such\nholder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s Shares will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger\nAgreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120\ndays after the Effective Time or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation an effective written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such Shares for any purpose or to\nreceive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s Shares, if any, payable to\nstockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a\nwritten withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with\nthe written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the court, and\nsuch approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing will not affect the right of any\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights.\nConsequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\nSolicitation of Proxies\u037e Payment of Solicitation Expenses",

If the Merger is completed, the holders of Shares\n(other than the holders of Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares) will have the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration of $41.00 per share of Company Common Stock in cash, without interest, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set\nforth in the Merger Agreement. For a detailed description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, see\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d\nAs discussed in the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors \u2014 Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Company\nBoard and the Special Committee\u037e Fairness of the Merger,\u201d the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) has determined that the\nMerger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and\nthe Company\u2019s stockholders.\nOur stockholders must approve the Merger Agreement Proposal in order for the Merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to approve the Merger\nAgreement Proposal, the Merger will not occur.\nVote Required\nThe approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of: (i) a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Company Common Stock\nentitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, with holders of Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock voting together as\na single class, (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Class A Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, (iii) a majority of\nthe outstanding shares of Company Class B Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL and (iv) the affirmative vote of Public\nStockholders holding a majority of the voting power of outstanding Company Common Stock held by the Public Stockholders, with holders of Company\nClass A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock voting as a single class.\nEach record holder of Company Class A Common Stock is entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Company Class A Common Stock owned of\nrecord on the Record Date and each record holder of Company Class B Common Stock is entitled to ten (10) votes for each share of Company Class B\nCommon Stock owned of record on the Record Date.\nAppraisal Rights\nIf the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold Shares through the Effective Time, who do not vote such Shares in favor of\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of such Shares and do not effectively withdraw their demands or otherwise\nlose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to an appraisal of such Shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means\nthat holders of Shares who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter effectively withdraw their demand for appraisal, and who follow the\nprocedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have such Shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to\nreceive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of such Shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nMerger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (or in certain\ncircumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Special Meeting \u2014 Appraisal Rights,\u201d on the difference\nbetween the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek\nappraisal of their Shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of\nappraisal rights.\n113Table of Contents\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL\ncould be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not\nseek appraisal of their Shares.\nTo exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is taken on the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) not submit a proxy with respect to, or otherwise vote, the Shares for which you seek appraisal in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) continue to hold such Shares of record on and from the date of the making of the demand through the Effective Time\u037e\nand (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the\nprocedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal.\nThe DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Special\nMeeting \u2014 Appraisal Rights,\u201d which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A\ncopy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced and attached as Annex F to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement\nin its entirety. If, as of the Record Date, you are the beneficial owner of Shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee and you wish\nto exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with such broker, bank or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a\ndemand for appraisal by such broker, bank or other nominee.",
