The Merger Agreement, the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the\nEmployee Matters Agreement and the Merger Agreement were further amended by the Amendment and Consent, by and among Meredith, NMG\nSpinCo, Gray, Merger Sub, and Dotdash, dated as of October 6, 2021 (the \u201cConsent Agreement\u201d), which is attached as Annex H to this proxy\nstatement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Consent Agreement, the Consent Agreement affirms Gray\u2019s consent to Meredith\u2019s and NMG\nSpinCo\u2019s execution, delivery and performance of the Dotdash Merger Agreement for all purposes under the Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off\nAgreements. Among other things, the Consent Agreement provides that the Dotdash Merger cannot occur prior to the completion of the Merger\n(or, if earlier, the termination of the Merger Agreement). The Consent Agreement also provides for certain adjustments to the Target Net Debt\nAmount (as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement and described below), which have the effect of increasing the amount of the\nSpinCo Cash Payment. The final amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment does not affect or reduce the $16.99 cash payment per share to be received in\nthe Gray Merger.\nMeredith encourages you to read the entire agreements carefully because they are the principal documents governing the transactions, including\nthe Separation, Distribution, Spin-Off (as described below) and Merger. For more information on the transaction agreements, see \u201cProposal 1\u201d\nbelow, beginning on page 50.\nTransaction Steps\nStep 1. Separation.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at a time on or prior to the date of the Distribution (as defined below), Meredith\nwill cause (1) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the NMG business segment, the MNI and People\nTV businesses and the corporate functions of Meredith to be transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be assumed by, NMG SpinCo\nand (2) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the LMG business segment to be retained by or\ntransferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be retained by or assumed by, Meredith (collectively, the \u201cSeparation\u201d). Following the\nSeparation, NMG SpinCo and its subsidiaries will own all of the NMG business segment and corporate functions, while Meredith (excluding NMG\nSpinCo and its subsidiaries) will own all of the LMG business segment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses).\n2Table of Contents\nStep 2. SpinCo Cash Payment and Repayment of Meredith Debt.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, prior to the Distribution, NMG SpinCo or one of its subsidiaries will make a\ncash payment (referred to as the \u201cSpinCo Cash Payment\u201d) to Meredith such that the net debt of Meredith (exclusive of any NMG SpinCo debt and\nafter giving effect to the SpinCo Cash Payment) would be equal to $1.975 billion (subject to certain adjustments, the amount of net debt agreed by\nMeredith and Gray to be allocated to Meredith in connection with the Separation and Spin-Off (as described below)). The proceeds of the SpinCo\nCash Payment, together with cash on hand of Meredith and borrowings by Gray, will be used to satisfy all of Meredith\u2019s outstanding long-term debt\nas of the date of the closing of the Merger. The SpinCo Cash Payment is expected to be funded through the following sources: available cash on\nhand (which will be taken into account in determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through borrowings under a new senior credit\nfacility from the SpinCo Debt Financing (as defined below) or, if the Dotdash Merger (as defined below) is completed on the same day as the closing\nof the Spin-Off and Merger, through funds advanced by Dotdash, in connection with the Dotdash Merger.\nStep 3. Distribution and Spin-Off.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, following the Separation and immediately prior to the Merger, Meredith will\nconsummate a spin off of NMG SpinCo by distributing (the \u201cDistribution\u201d) (i) the shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of NMG\nSpinCo (\u201cNMG SpinCo Common Stock\u201d) to Meredith shareholders holding Meredith Common Stock, and (ii) the shares of Class B Common Stock,\npar value $1.00 per share, of NMG SpinCo (\u201cNMG SpinCo Class B Stock\u201d) to Meredith shareholders holding Meredith Class B Stock, in each case\non a one-for-one basis such that NMG SpinCo will maintain Meredith\u2019s existing dual-class voting structure (collectively, the \u201cSpin-Off\u201d). Prior to\ncompletion of the Merger, Meredith will set the Distribution Record Date and a date for the Distribution to occur (the \u201cDistribution Date\u201d). Meredith\nexpects such Distribution Date to be the same date as the date that the Merger is completed, but the record date for the Distribution (the\n\u201cDistribution Record Date\u201d) will be an earlier date.\nAfter the Distribution, if the Dotdash Merger is not consummated on the same day: the NMG SpinCo Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per\nshare with respect to matters on which the NMG SpinCo shareholders are entitled to vote\u037e the NMG SpinCo Class B Stock will be entitled to ten\nvotes per share on such matters\u037e NMG SpinCo will be a standalone, publicly traded company owned 100% by pre-merger Meredith shareholders\u037e\nand NMG SpinCo is expected to retain the \u201cMeredith\u201d name and \u201cMDP\u201d ticker symbol.\nStep 4. Merger.\nThe Merger (page 50). Under the Merger Agreement, immediately after the consummation of the Spin-Off, Merger Sub will merge with and into\nMeredith, and Meredith will be the surviving corporation in the Merger. Upon the consummation of the Merger (the \u201cClosing\u201d), Gray will own all\noutstanding shares of capital stock of Meredith. Our shareholders will receive cash in the Merger in exchange for their shares of Meredith Common\nStock and Meredith Class B Stock. This cash will be in addition to the shares of NMG SpinCo that our shareholders will receive pursuant to the\nDistribution.\nMerger Consideration (page 104). If the Merger is completed, you will receive $16.99 in cash, without interest and subject to all applicable tax\nwithholding (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d), in exchange for each share of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock that you own\nunless, in the case of Meredith Class B Stock, you have properly demanded (and not withdrawn or lost) your appraisal rights under Iowa law.\nAdditionally, immediately prior to and as a condition to the Merger, you will receive one share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock for each share of\nMeredith Common Stock, and one share of NMG SpinCo Class B Stock for each share of Meredith Class B Stock, that you hold as of the\nDistribution Record Date. After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have\nany ongoing ownership interest in the continuing LMG business of Meredith.\n3\nTable of Contents\nDotdash Merger (page 51). On October 6, 2021, Meredith announced that the Company and NMG SpinCo have entered into an Agreement and Plan\nof Merger, dated as of October 6, 2021, by and among Dotdash Media Inc. (formerly known as About, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (\u201cDotdash\u201d),\nMeredith, NMG SpinCo and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, IAC/InterActiveCorp, a Delaware corporation (\u201cIAC\u201d) (the \u201cDotdash\nMerger Agreement\u201d) to sell NMG SpinCo (which will consist of NMG, the MNI and People TV businesses, and corporate operations at the time of\nthe acquisition) to Dotdash, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC, which we refer to as the \u201cDotdash Merger\u201d. Completion of the Dotdash Merger is\nnot a condition to consummation of the Spin-Off and Merger, and for so long as the Merger Agreement is in effect, the Dotdash Merger will not,\npursuant to the Consent Agreement, occur until after the Closing of the Merger. We currently expect the Dotdash Merger to be consummated on the\nsame day as and following the consummation of the Spin-Off and the Merger, if the closing conditions for the Dotdash Merger have been satisfied\nor waived. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the Spin-Off and the Merger, NMG SpinCo will continue as a stand-alone,\npublicly traded company until consummation of the Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement, unless the Dotdash Merger is\nterminated earlier. If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the LMG business and, until the\nDotdash Merger is completed, NMG, and in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain\namendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement.\nPursuant to the IBCA, Meredith shareholders are not required to vote on the Dotdash Merger and are not being asked to vote on the Dotdash\nMerger. The Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board, by the board of NMG SpinCo\nand by the Company, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is the only shareholder vote\nrequired for the Dotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the consummation of the\nDotdash Merger.\nIf the Dotdash Merger is completed, each holder of NMG SpinCo Stock will be entitled to receive $42.18 in cash, subject to downward adjustment as\nprovided in the Dotdash Merger Agreement, for each share of NMG SpinCo Stock. The cash payment received by NMG SpinCo shareholders will be\nin addition to the cash Merger Consideration that Meredith shareholders will receive if the Merger is completed.\nFor more information regarding the Dotdash Merger, the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the consideration that shareholders will receive in respect\nof the shares of NMG SpinCo that will have previously been received by Meredith shareholders in the Spin-Off, see the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 7, 2021.\nTreatment of Equity Awards (page 86).",

The number of shares subject to the adjusted Company\n4Table of Contents\nstock option and the NMG SpinCo stock option will be equal to the number of shares subject to the related Company stock option prior to the Spin-\nOff, but the exercise prices will be adjusted to reflect the relative values of LMG and NMG.

Pursuant to the Iowa Business Corporation Act (the \u201cIBCA\u201d), the holder of each share of Meredith Class B Stock is\nentitled to rights of appraisal under Section 490.1302 of the IBCA, in connection with the Merger with respect to their Meredith Class B Stock. This\nright of appraisal is subject to a number of restrictions and technical requirements, as further described herein. Holders of Meredith Common Stock\nare not entitled to appraisal rights under the IBCA in connection with the transaction with respect to those shares.\nDue to the complexity of the appraisal process, shareholders who wish to seek appraisal of their Meredith Class B Stock are encouraged to seek the\nadvice of legal counsel and financial advisors with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. Shareholders considering seeking appraisal should be\naware that the fair value of their Meredith Class B Stock as determined pursuant to the IBCA could be greater than, the same as or less than the\nvalue of the Merger Consideration.\nPlease see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 92 for additional information regarding appraisal rights for holders of Meredith\nClass B Stock and Annex C for a copy of the IBCA provisions governing such appraisal rights.\nCertain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution the Merger and the Dotdash Merger (page 95).\nIn general, the receipt of shares of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock (collectively, \u201cNMG SpinCo Stock\u201d) by you in the\nDistribution, the receipt of cash by you in exchange for your shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock pursuant to the Merger,\nand, if the Dotdash Merger is completed, the receipt of cash by you in exchange for your shares of NMG SpinCo Stock will be taxable transactions\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt by you of shares of NMG SpinCo Stock in the Distribution will generally be a taxable dividend in an\namount equal to the fair market value of the NMG SpinCo Stock received to the extent of your ratable share of Meredith\u2019s current and accumulated\nearnings and profits, with the excess treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your tax basis in shares of Meredith Common\nStock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable, and then as capital gain. Generally, in the Merger you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the total amount of cash you receive in the Merger for your shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B\nStock and your adjusted tax basis in such shares. If the Dotdash Merger is completed, you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference,\nif any, between the total amount of cash you receive in the Dotdash Merger for your shares of NMG SpinCo Stock and your adjusted tax basis in\nsuch shares, which gain or loss may be equal to zero.\nYou should read \u201cThe Merger\u2014Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution and the Merger and the Dotdash\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 95 for a more complete summary of certain material\n7Table of Contents\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the Distribution and the\nMerger to you will depend on the facts of your own situation. You should consult your own tax advisor to understand fully the tax consequences\nof the Distribution, the Merger and the Dotdash Merger to you.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 99). The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR\nAct\u201d), prohibits us from completing the Merger until we have furnished certain information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the Department\nof Justice (the \u201cAntitrust Division\u201d) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and any required waiting period under the HSR Act (and\nany extension thereof) has expired or been terminated. Both Meredith and Gray made filings under the HSR Act on May 14, 2021. On June 14, 2021,\nMeredith and Gray each received a Request for Additional Information (a \u201cSecond Request\u201d) from the Antitrust Division, which defines the\n\u201cRelevant Area\u201d as the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City, Michigan Designated Market Area (\u201cDMA\u201d) and the \u201cRelevant Product\u201d as \u201cthe sale of spot\nadvertising time on broadcast television stations.\u201d The issuance of a Second Request extends the waiting period until thirty calendar days after\nMeredith and Gray comply with the Second Request or until the Antitrust Division terminates the waiting period. On July 14, 2021, Gray announced\nan agreement to divest its WJRT-TV station in the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City, Michigan DMA to Allen Media Broadcasting, LLC (\u201cAllen Media\u201d). On\nSeptember 21, 2021, the Antitrust Division advised that it had no objections to Allen Media Group as the buyer of WJRT-TV. On September 23, 2021,\nGray consummated the sale of WJRT-TV to Allen Media. As a result, Gray and Meredith no longer operate stations in the same DMA. The Antitrust\nDivision informed Meredith on September 28, 2021 that it has closed its investigation of the Merger, and on October 8, 2021, the waiting period\nunder the HSR Act was terminated.\nIn addition, consent from the Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d) to transfer control of Meredith and the broadcast licensee\nsubsidiaries of Meredith is required prior to completing the Merger. Meredith and Gray filed applications for FCC consent on May 14, 2021, and the\nFCC issued a public notice accepting the applications and establishing a comment cycle on May 26, 2021. One viewer filed comments that are not\nspecific to the proposed transaction, and Gray and Meredith jointly filed a response to the comment. Also, a company that sells outdoor television\nantennas filed an Informal Objection\u037e Request for Condition (the \u201cObjection\u201d) proposing that the FCC impose a condition on its approval of the\ntransaction requiring Gray to accept reasonable advertisement requests from vendors of over-the-air antennas. Meredith and Gray responded to the\nObjection and asked the FCC to process the transaction without delay. To facilitate regulatory approvals for the Merger, Gray agreed to divest\nWJRT-TV in the Flint-Saginaw DMA, the only market in which both Gray and Meredith operate stations. On July 14, 2021, Gray announced an\nagreement to divest WJRT-TV pursuant to an agreement with Allen Media Broadcasting, LLC (\u201cAllen Media\u201d). On July 23, 2021, Gray filed an\napplication seeking consent to assign the license for WJRT-TV to Allen Media. On July 27, 2021, the FCC issued a public notice accepting the\napplication and establishing August 26, 2021 as the deadline for filing petitions to deny. The FCC granted the WJRT-TV assignment application on\nSeptember 10, 2021, and Gray and Allen Media consummated the WJRT-TV transaction on September 23, 2021.\nPlease see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 99 and \u201cMerger Agreement\u2014Efforts to Close the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 117 for more information about the required regulatory approvals.",

            "text": "Financing of the Transactions (page 100)\nNMG SpinCo\nMeredith anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to pay transaction fees and expenses will be approximately $45 million, in addition to\nthe funds necessary for NMG SpinCo to make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith, which will be approximately $625 million, which amount is\nsubject to adjustment as further described in this proxy statement. This amount is expected to be funded through the following sources: available\ncash on hand (which will be taken into account in determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through borrowings under a new senior\ncredit facility from the SpinCo Debt Financing or, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger,\nthrough funds advanced by Dotdash, in connection with the Dotdash Merger.\nTo provide the debt financing required by Meredith to fund the SpinCo Cash Payment, Meredith entered into a commitment letter (the \u201cExisting\nSpinCo Commitment Letter\u201d), dated June 25, 2021 (amending and restating its financing commitment letter dated May 3, 2021, as amended and\nrestated May 24, 2021), with Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse AG, and the other lenders party thereto (the \u201cInitial\nLenders\u201d). In connection with entering into the Dotdash Merger Agreement, and to facilitate the SpinCo Cash Payment obligations of Meredith\n(should the Dotdash Merger not be completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger), Meredith (i) terminated the Existing\nSpinCo Commitment Letter and (ii) entered into a replacement commitment letter (the \u201cSpinCo Commitment Letter\u201d) with Royal Bank and Barclays\n(collectively, the \u201cCommitment Parties\u201d) on October 6, 2021, pursuant to which Meredith has received commitments from the Commitment Parties to\nprovide to NMG SpinCo $725 million of secured term loans pursuant to a term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) and $150 million of secured\nrevolving commitments (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d and collectively, the \u201cFacilities\u201d). The borrower under the Facilities will be a designated\nsubsidiary of NMG SpinCo and the obligations of the borrower will be guaranteed by NMG SpinCo and the subsidiaries of the borrower (subject to\ncustomary exceptions to be agreed). The amount of initial borrowings under the Facilities will be determined prior to the closing date of the Merger\nbased on the total amount of funds necessary for NMG SpinCo to make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith (which, in turn, will depend on the\nactual amount of Meredith\u2019s net debt on the closing date of the Merger) and to pay transaction fees and expenses.\nThe obligation of Meredith and Gray to consummate the Merger is subject to completion of the Distribution and Spin-Off. The obligation of\nMeredith to consummate the Distribution and Spin-Off is subject to the consummation and funding of the Facilities in accordance with the SpinCo\nCommitment Letter (the \u201cSpinCo Debt Financing\u201d) and payment of the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith in accordance with the Separation and\nDistribution Agreement.\n14Table of Contents\nFunding of the Facilities is subject to customary conditions, including the negotiation of definitive documentation for the Facilities, that no material\nadverse effect on the financial condition, business or operations of NMG SpinCo has occurred and other customary closing conditions consistent\nwith the Merger Agreement and the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nGray\nGray anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to finance the transactions and to pay transaction fees and expenses will be approximately\n$2.89 billion. This amount is expected to be funded through one or more of the following sources: available cash on hand, the issuance and sale by\nGray of notes in a public offering or in a Rule 144A private placement, and borrowings under the Gray term loan facility and bridge facility as\ndescribed below.\nTo provide the debt financing required by Gray to consummate the Merger, Gray has entered into a financing commitment letter (the \u201cGray\nCommitment Letter\u201d), dated June 2, 2021 (amending and restating its financing commitment letter, dated May 3, 2021) with Wells Fargo Bank,\nNational Association and the other lenders party thereto, pursuant to which the lenders have committed to provide the debt financing for a portion\nof the purchase price to be paid to complete the Merger and the satisfaction of certain existing indebtedness of Meredith, with an incremental term\nloan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.45 billion and a bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.475 billion less the principal\namount of any notes issued prior to the date of completion of the Merger. The funding under the Gray Commitment Letter is subject to customary\nconditions for commitments of this type. While the obligation of Gray to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition, the Gray\nCommitment Letter includes a customary marketing period, and, without Gray\u2019s and Meredith\u2019s agreement, the closing of the Merger will not occur\nearlier than (i) December 1, 2021 or (ii) the completion of the marketing period (unless the marketing period is scheduled to be completed after\nDecember 30, 2021, in which event the closing of the Merger will occur on December 30, 2021).\nPlease see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Transactions\u201d on page 100 for a more fulsome description of the SpinCo Commitment Letter and the Gray\nCommitment Letter.\nExpected Timing (page 34)",

As described elsewhere herein, this sale will be effected by (1) the Spin-Off, in which Meredith shareholders will receive\ninterests in NMG SpinCo,\n15Table of Contents\nwhich will hold NMG and the corporate functions of Meredith, followed immediately by (2) the Merger of Meredith, holding the assets of LMG, with\na subsidiary of Gray (the \u201cTransactions\u201d).\nThe Transactions will be accounted for as a reverse spin-off, for reasons including that the legacy shareholders will continue to hold NMG SpinCo\nCapital Stock and not Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock and that senior management will continue to manage NMG SpinCo and\nnot Meredith. The resulting accounting treatment is as though LMG is spun off and acquired by Gray, to leave behind NMG SpinCo, comprising\nNMG and the corporate functions, which is the reverse of the legal form of the Transactions.\nThe pro forma condensed financial statements include the following pro forma adjustments to the historical financial information of Meredith:\n\u2022\nTransaction Accounting Adjustments \u2013 Adjustments that reflect the application of required accounting for the Transactions and other\nrelated transactions as follows:\n\u2022\nin the pro forma condensed balance sheet, as though they occurred as of June 30, 2021\u037e and\n\u2022\nin the pro forma condensed statements of earnings (loss), the effects of the above pro forma balance sheet adjustments assuming\nthose adjustments were made as of July 1, 2020.\n\u2022\nAutonomous Entity Adjustments \u2013 Adjustments that are necessary to reflect the operations and financial position of NMG SpinCo as\nan autonomous entity.\nThe pro forma condensed statements of earnings (loss) for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 present LMG on a discontinued operations basis\nbecause that presentation is not yet required in the historical financial statements for those periods.\nThe pro forma adjustments are based on factually supportable and available information and certain assumptions that management believes are\nreasonable. In the opinion of management, all necessary adjustments have been made in preparing the pro forma condensed financial statements.\nHowever, such adjustments are estimates and actual experience may differ from expectations. The pro forma condensed financial statements\npresented do not purport to represent what the results of operations or financial position of NMG SpinCo would actually have been had the\nTransactions and related transactions occurred on the dates noted above, or to project the results of operations or financial position of NMG\nSpinCo for any future periods. The pro forma condensed balance sheet does not give effect to, for example, cash generated by or used in operations,\nor collection of long-term receivables, after June 30, 2021.\nThe pro forma condensed financial statements have been derived from the historical audited consolidated financial statements of Meredith included\nin its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30,

adjustments are as follows:\n(1)\nNMG SpinCo is required to make a cash payment of an amount that will result in the net debt (calculated as outstanding principal plus\ndebt breakage fees minus LMG cash on hand to be transferred in the Transactions to Gray) being equal to $1,975.0 million, as adjusted\nfor Meredith equity awards retired or issued prior to closing and as may be further adjusted downward for unpaid expenses incurred by\nMeredith.

Further, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, the target net debt amount will be reduced (and as a result,\nthe net cash payment required will be increased) by $30.0 million\u037e provided that if Meredith provides the financial statements\ncomprising the RemainCo Required Financial Information in the Consent Agreement, then the target net debt amount will be reduced\n(and as a result, the net cash payment required will be increased) by only $25.0 million. In addition, pursuant to the Consent\nAgreement, if the closing of the Transactions occurs but does not occur on or before December 1, 2021, then, for each day thereafter\nuntil the closing, the target net debt amount will be reduced (and as a result, the net cash payment required will be increased) by\n$725,000, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Consent Agreement.\n22\nTable of Contents\n(2)\nRepresents the impact of new debt facilities entered into by NMG SpinCo, as follows:\nPro forma outstanding\nas of June 30, 2021\n(In millions)\nPro\nforma\ninterest\nexpense2\n(In\nmillions)\nFacility\nPrincipal\nbalance\nUnamortized\ndebt\nissuance\ncosts\nCarrying\nvalue\nInterest\nterms1\nYear\nended\nJune 30,\n2021\n$725 million term loan\n$\n725.0\n$\n(23.5)\n$\n701.5\nL+5.25%3\n$\n44.2\n$200 million revolving credit facility\n\u2014\n(6.5)\n(6.5)\nL+5.25%\n1.3\nTotal debt proceeds\n725.0\n(30.0)\n695.0\n$\n45.5\nReclass revolver debt issuance costs4\n\u2014\n6.5\n6.5\nTotal long-term debt\n725.0\n(23.5)\n701.5\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n(18.1)\n\u2014\n(18.1)\nLong-term debt\n$\n706.9\n$\n(23.5)\n$\n683.4\n1\nL is an abbreviation for London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)\n2\nIncludes amortization of deferred debt issuance costs\n3\nLIBOR subject to a floor of 0.50%\n4\nDebt issuance costs associated with the revolving credit facility will be capitalized as an asset and accordingly are excluded from the\ncalculation of long-term debt.\nThe extent to which the revolving credit facility is funded at closing will be dependent on the amount of the required cash payment described\nin note (1) above and available cash on hand as of that date, which will be impacted by factors including cash flows generated from or used in\noperations and collections of long-term receivables prior to closing.

            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting.\nThese questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to you. You should carefully read and consider the more detailed\ninformation contained elsewhere in this proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the\ndocuments we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you. You\nmay obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the caption \u201cWhere You\nCan Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\nA:\nThe Board of Directors is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies\nto be voted at the Special Meeting. The Special Meeting will be held (a) to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\nand thereby approve the Merger, (b) to consider and vote, on an advisory basis, on the compensation that Meredith\u2019s named executive officers\nmay receive in connection with the Merger and (c) to vote to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if\nthere are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger. No vote of\nMeredith shareholders is required or being sought in connection with the Spin-Off or the Dotdash Merger.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Special Meeting will take place on November 30, 2021, at 10:00 a.m. Central Standard Time. The Special Meeting will be held in virtual format\nonly. You will be able to attend the Special Meeting online, during which you can vote your shares, by visiting www.proxydocs.com/MDP.\nRegistration online at www.proxydocs.com/MDP is required for attendance. Shareholders will not be able to attend the meeting in person.\nQ:\nWhat are the key steps of the Spin-Off and Merger transactions?\nA:\nBelow is a summary of the key steps of the Spin-Off and Merger transactions. See \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement The Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 50.\nStep 1. Separation.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at a time on or prior to the date of the Distribution, Meredith will consummate\nthe Separation by causing (1) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the NMG business segment, the\nMNI and People TV businesses and the corporate functions of Meredith to be transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be assumed\nby, NMG SpinCo and (2) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the LMG business segment to be\nretained by or transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be retained by or assumed by, Meredith. Following the Separation, NMG\nSpinCo and its subsidiaries will own all of the NMG business segment and corporate functions, while Meredith (excluding NMG SpinCo and its\nsubsidiaries) will own all of the LMG business segment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses).\nStep 2. SpinCo Cash Payment and Repayment of Meredith Debt.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, prior to the Distribution, NMG SpinCo or one of its subsidiaries will make the\nSpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith such that the net debt of Meredith (exclusive of any NMG SpinCo debt and after giving effect to the SpinCo\nCash Payment) would be equal to $1.975 billion (subject to certain adjustments, the amount of net debt agreed by Meredith and Gray to be\n26Table of Contents\nallocated to Meredith in connection with the Separation and Spin-Off). The proceeds of the SpinCo Cash Payment will be used by Gray, together\nwith cash on hand of Meredith and borrowings by Gray, to satisfy all of Meredith\u2019s outstanding long-term debt as of the date of the Closing. The\nSpinCo Cash Payment is expected to be funded through the following sources: available cash on hand (which will be taken into account in\ndetermining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through borrowings under a new senior credit facility from the SpinCo Debt Financing\nor, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger, through funds advanced by Dotdash, in\nconnection with the Dotdash Merger.\nStep 3. Distribution and Spin-Off.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, following the Separation and immediately prior to the Merger, Meredith will\nconsummate the Spin-Off of NMG SpinCo by making the Distribution of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock to Meredith\nshareholders holding Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock, respectively, on a one-for-one basis such that NMG SpinCo will\nmaintain Meredith\u2019s existing dual-class voting structure. Prior to completion of the Merger, Meredith will set the Distribution Record Date and a\nDistribution Date. Meredith expects such Distribution Date to be the same date as the date that the Merger is completed, but the Distribution\nRecord Date will be an earlier date.\nAfter the Distribution, if the Dotdash Merger is not consummated on the same day: the NMG SpinCo Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per\nshare with respect to matters on which the NMG SpinCo shareholders are entitled to vote, the NMG SpinCo Class B Stock will be entitled to ten\nvotes per share on such matters, NMG SpinCo will be a standalone, publicly traded company owned 100% by the pre-merger shareholders of\nMeredith, and NMG SpinCo is expected to retain the \u201cMeredith\u201d name and \u201cMDP\u201d ticker symbol.\nStep 4. Merger.\nImmediately following completion of the Distribution, Merger Sub will merge with and into Meredith, with Meredith surviving the merger and\nbecoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Gray (referred to herein as LMG RemainCo). As a result of the Merger, Gray will acquire our LMG business\nsegment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses). In the Merger, each share of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock issued\nand outstanding immediately prior to the Closing will be converted into the right to receive $16.99 in cash, without interest and subject to all\napplicable tax withholding.\nDotdash Merger\nOn October 6, 2021, Meredith announced that the Company and NMG SpinCo have entered into the Dotdash Merger Agreement to sell NMG\nSpinCo to Dotdash. Completion of the Dotdash Merger is not a condition to consummation of the Spin-Off and Merger, and for so long as the\nMerger Agreement is in effect, the Dotdash Merger will not, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, occur until after the Closing of the Merger. We\ncurrently expect the Dotdash Merger to be consummated on the same day as and following the consummation of the Spin-Off and the Merger, if\nthe closing conditions for the Dotdash Merger have been satisfied or waived. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the Spin-\nOff and the Merger, NMG SpinCo will continue as a stand-alone, publicly traded company until consummation of the Dotdash Merger pursuant to\nthe Dotdash Merger Agreement, unless the Dotdash Merger is terminated earlier. If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a\npublicly-traded company operating the LMG business, and, until the Dotdash Merger is completed, NMG, and in the event the Merger Agreement\nis terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off\nAgreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement.\nPursuant to the IBCA, Meredith shareholders are not required to vote on the Dotdash Merger and are not being asked to vote on the Dotdash\nMerger. The Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board, by the board of NMG SpinCo\nand by the Company, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is the only shareholder vote\nrequired for the Dotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the consummation of the\nDotdash Merger.\n27\nTable of Contents\nIf the Dotdash Merger is completed, each holder of NMG SpinCo Stock will be entitled to receive $42.18 in cash, subject to downward adjustment\nas provided in the Dotdash Merger Agreement, for each share of NMG SpinCo Stock. The cash payment received by NMG SpinCo shareholders\nwill be in addition to the cash Merger Consideration that Meredith shareholders will receive if the Merger is completed.\nFor more information regarding the Dotdash Merger, the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the consideration that shareholders will receive in respect\nof the shares of NMG SpinCo that will have previously been received by Meredith shareholders in the Spin-Off, see the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 7, 2021.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to Meredith as a result of the Merger?\nA:\nIf the Merger is completed (which will occur immediately after the completion of the Spin-Off but prior to the Dotdash Merger), Meredith will\nbecome a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gray, and Gray will thereby acquire our LMG business segment, as described herein.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to my shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock after the Merger?\nA:\nUpon completion of the Merger, each outstanding share of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock will automatically be canceled and\nwill be converted into the right to receive $16.99 in cash, without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding. This does not apply to\nshares of Meredith Class B Stock held by any Meredith shareholders who have properly demanded (and not withdrawn or lost) their appraisal\nrights under Iowa law (as more fully described below under the heading \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 92 of this proxy\nstatement).\nAdditionally, prior to and as a condition to the Merger, Meredith will consummate the Spin-Off, whereby you will receive one share of NMG SpinCo\nCommon Stock for each share of Meredith Common Stock you hold and one share of NMG SpinCo Class B Stock for each share of Meredith Class\nB Stock you hold, as further described herein. If the Dotdash Merger is completed, each holder of NMG SpinCo Stock will be entitled to receive\n$42.18 in cash, subject to downward adjustment as provided in the Dotdash Merger Agreement, for each share of NMG SpinCo Stock.\nQ:\nWhy is the Spin-Off important and a condition to the Closing?\nA:\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Meredith, with Meredith surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of Gray, following which Gray will own Meredith\u2019s LMG business segment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses). In order to\neffect this transaction, the assets and liabilities relating to Meredith\u2019s NMG business segments must first be separated from the remainder of\nMeredith so that, at the Closing, Meredith only owns the assets and liabilities relating to the LMG business segment that Gray has agreed to\nacquire. Accordingly, the separation of Meredith into two independent companies by way of the Spin-Off is an important step in the transactions\nagreed to by the parties, and the consummation of the Spin-Off is a condition to the Closing of the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat is the impact of Meredith\u2019s entry into the Dotdash Merger Agreement?\nA:\nOn October 6, 2021, Meredith announced that the Company and NMG SpinCo entered into the Dotdash Merger Agreement to sell NMG SpinCo to\nDotdash, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC. Completion of the Dotdash Merger is not a condition to consummation of the Spin-Off and Merger,\nand for so long as the Merger Agreement is in effect, the Dotdash Merger will not, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, occur until after the\nClosing of the Merger. We currently expect the Dotdash Merger to be consummated on the same day as and following the consummation of the\nSpin-Off and the Merger, if the closing conditions for the Dotdash Merger have been satisfied or waived. If the Dotdash Merger is completed, each\nholder of NMG SpinCo Stock will be entitled to receive $42.18 in cash, subject to downward adjustment as provided in the Dotdash Merger\nAgreement, for each share of NMG SpinCo Stock.\n28\nTable of Contents\nPursuant to the IBCA, Meredith shareholders are not required to vote on the Dotdash Merger and are not being asked to vote on the Dotdash\nMerger. The Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board, by the board of NMG SpinCo\nand by the Company, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is the only shareholder vote\nrequired for the Dotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the consummation of the\nDotdash Merger.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock before the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date for shareholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is November 15, 2021, which is earlier than the date of the Special\nMeeting. If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as\nprovision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you transfer your shares and each of you notifies us in writing of such special\narrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the special meeting but will otherwise transfer ownership of your shares of Meredith\nCommon Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock before the completion of the\nMerger?\nA:\nOnly holders of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock at the effective time of the Merger will become entitled to receive the\nMerger Consideration. If you sell your shares prior to the completion of the Merger, you will not become entitled to receive the Merger\nConsideration by virtue of the Merger. Additionally, prior to the completion of the Merger, Meredith will set the Distribution Record Date and the\nDistribution Date in connection with the Spin-Off. Meredith expects such Distribution Date to be the same date as the date that the Merger is\ncompleted, but the Distribution Record Date will be an earlier date. Only holders of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock as\nof such Distribution Record Date will become entitled to receive shares of NMG SpinCo in the Spin-Off. If the Dotdash Merger is completed,\nholders of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock at the time of the closing of the Dotdash Merger will receive $42.18 in cash\n(subject to downward adjustment as set forth in the Dotdash Merger Agreement).\nQ:\nWill I own any shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock after the Merger?\nA:\nNo. You will be paid cash for any shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock you own in Meredith. Additionally, prior to and as a\ncondition to the Merger, you will receive one share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock for each share of Meredith Common Stock you hold and one\nshare of NMG SpinCo Class B Stock for each share of Meredith Class B Stock you hold as of the Distribution Record Date pursuant to the\nDistribution, as further described herein. If the Dotdash Merger is completed, holders of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B\nStock at the time of the closing of the Dotdash Merger will receive $42.18 in cash (subject to downward adjustment as set forth in the Dotdash\nMerger Agreement).\nQ:\nWill I own any shares of Gray Common Stock after the Merger?\nA:\nOnly if you own shares of common stock, no par value per share, Pursuant to the IBCA, of Gray or Class A common stock, no par value per share,\nof Gray (collectively, \u201cGray Common Stock\u201d) before the Merger and you continue to hold those shares after the Merger. The shares of Gray\nCommon Stock that you own, if any, prior to the Merger will be unaffected as a result of the Merger. Our shareholders will not be issued any shares\nof Gray Common Stock as a result of the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat happens to my vested and unvested Meredith stock options, RSUs and Share-Based Awards in the Merger?\nA:\nUpon the completion of the Merger, each outstanding stock option, RSU and Share-Based Award granted under Meredith\u2019s equity plans (including\nsuch options, RSUs and Share Based Awards that vest in connection with the Merger) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive from\nGray an amount\n29\nTable of Contents\nof cash equal to $16.99 per share (or in the case of stock options, the excess, if any, of $16.99 over the exercise price of such option, as adjusted in\nconnection with the Spin-Off), without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding.\nPrior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, each outstanding stock option granted under Meredith\u2019s equity plans will be\nconverted into two options: (1) an adjusted Company stock option that will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in\nthe Merger as described above, and (2) a stock option for NMG SpinCo shares.

The Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board,\nby the board of NMG SpinCo and by the Company, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is\nthe only shareholder vote required for the Dotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the\nconsummation of the Dotdash Merger.\n31\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nAre any Meredith shareholders already committed to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal?\nA:\nIn connection with entry into the Merger Agreement, Gray entered into the Support Agreement with certain Company shareholders, including\nDianna Mell Meredith Frazier and Edwin T. Meredith, IV, who collectively control 1.7% of the issued and outstanding Meredith Common Stock and\napproximately 89.3% of the issued and outstanding Meredith Class B Stock (representing approximately 50.3% of the voting power when voting\ntogether as a single class) as of the Record Date.

You should instruct\nyour broker to vote your shares, following the procedure provided by your broker. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted with respect\nto the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the approval of, on an advisory basis, the compensation that Meredith\u2019s named\n34\nTable of Contents\nexecutive officers may receive in connection with the Merger or, to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies\nif there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the stock certificates\nor book-entry shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA:\nThe Merger is currently expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger\ncannot occur earlier than (i) December 1, 2021 or (ii) the completion of the marketing period under the Gray Commitment Letter (unless such\nmarketing period is scheduled to be completed after December 30, 2021, in which event the Closing will occur on December 30, 2021, in each case\nunless otherwise agreed by Meredith, Gray and Merger Sub). However, neither Meredith nor Gray can predict the actual date on which the Merger\nwill be completed, nor can Meredith or Gray be certain that the Merger will be completed, because completion is subject to conditions beyond the\ncontrol of Meredith and Gray.\nIf the conditions to completing the Dotdash Merger have been satisfied or waived, Meredith currently expects the Dotdash Merger to be\nconsummated on the same day as, and following completion of, the Spin-Off and Merger. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day\nas the Spin-Off and Merger, NMG SpinCo will continue as a stand-alone, publicly traded company until consummation of the Dotdash Merger\npursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement unless the Dotdash Merger Agreement is terminated earlier.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Meredith\u2019s shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Meredith\u2019s\nshareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock and NMG SpinCo will not be spun\noff into an independently traded public company. Instead, Meredith will remain an independent public company, the Meredith Common Stock will\ncontinue to be listed and traded on NYSE and Meredith will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC on account of the Meredith Common\nStock.\nUnder specified circumstances, Meredith and/or Gray may be required to reimburse each party\u2019s expenses or pay a termination fee upon termination\nof the Merger Agreement, as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Expenses and Termination Fees Relating to the Termination of the\nMerger Agreement.\u201d\nIf the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the Local Media Group business, and in the event\nthe Merger Agreement is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and\nthe Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nWhen will I receive the cash consideration for my shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock?\nA:\nAfter the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the stock certificates or\nbook-entry shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. When you properly return and complete the required documentation described in the\nwritten instructions or letter of transmittal, you will receive from the exchange agent a payment of the cash consideration for your shares.\n35\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhen will I receive the cash consideration for my shares of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock resulting from the\nDotdash Merger?\nA:\nAfter the Dotdash Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the stock\ncertificates or book-entry shares of NMG SpinCo pursuant to such letter of transmittal. When you properly return and complete the required\ndocumentation described in the written instructions or letter of transmittal, you will receive from the exchange agent a payment of cash\nconsideration for your shares.\nQ:\nIs the Spin-Off dependent on Meredith\u2019s shareholders approving the Merger?\nA:\nNo. Meredith shareholder approval is not a condition of the Spin-Off. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason,\nMeredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the LMG business and NMG business, and Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to\nnegotiate certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the agreement relating to the Spin-Off, subject to the terms of the Dotdash\nMerger Agreement. In such a scenario, it is possible that Meredith could either abandon the Spin-Off or nevertheless spin off NMG to its\nshareholders in connection with the disposition of that business in the Dotdash Merger.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to cast an advisory vote to approve the compensation that Meredith\u2019s named executive officers may receive in connection\nwith the Merger?\nA:\nIn accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, we are required to provide our shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the\ncompensation that Meredith\u2019s named executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger, which is reflected in the Compensation\nProposal herein.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if our shareholders do not approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation that Meredith\u2019s named executive officers may receive\nin connection with the Merger?\nA:\nApproval of the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation arrangements payable under existing agreements that the named executive officers of Meredith\nmay receive in connection with the Merger is not a condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d\ncompensation arrangements is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Gray or us. Therefore, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by our\nshareholders and completed, the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation arrangements will still be paid to our named executive officers as long as any\nother conditions applicable thereto are satisfied, regardless of the results of the vote.\nQ:\nWho can help answer my additional questions?\nA:\nIf you would like additional copies, without charge, of this proxy statement or if you have additional questions about the Merger, including with\nrespect to the procedures for voting your shares, you should contact us, as follows:\nMeredith Corporation\n1716 Locust Street\nDes Moines, Iowa 50309\nTelephone: (515) 284-3000\nYou may also contact our proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, at:\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, NY 10022\nShareholders may call toll free: (877) 717-3923\nBanks and Brokers may call collect: (212) 750-5833\n36\nTable of Contents\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO PROPOSAL 1",

We have expended\nand will continue to expend a significant amount of time and resources on the transaction, and a failure to consummate the transaction as currently\ncontemplated, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on Meredith\u2019s business and results of operations.\nIf the Merger is not completed, the ongoing business of Meredith may be adversely affected and Meredith will be subject to several risks, including the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\nthe Spin-Off will not be completed\u037e\n\u2022\nbeing required, under certain circumstances, to pay Gray a termination fee of $73 million\u037e\n\u2022\nbeing required, under certain circumstances, to pay Gray a termination fee of $113 million\u037e\n\u2022\nbeing required, under certain circumstances, to reimburse certain of Gray\u2019s expenses up to $10 million\u037e\n\u2022\nhaving to pay substantial other costs and expenses relating to the proposed transaction, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing,\nprinting and mailing fees and integration costs that have already been incurred and will continue to be incurred until closing\u037e\n\u2022\nthe focus of management of Meredith on the Merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to Meredith\u037e\n\u2022\nthe market price of Meredith could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be\ncompleted\u037e and\n37Table of Contents\n\u2022\nif the Merger Agreement is terminated and Meredith\u2019s board of directors seeks another business combination for LMG, shareholders of\nMeredith cannot be certain that Meredith will be able to find a party willing to enter into a business combination or other strategic\ntransaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Gray has agreed to in the Merger Agreement and Spin-Off\nAgreements\u037e\nin each case, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of having the Merger and Spin-Off completed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed,\nMeredith may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. Meredith could also be subject to litigation\nrelated to any failure to complete the Merger and Spin-Off or to enforcement proceedings commenced against Meredith to perform its obligations under\nthe Merger Agreement and Spin-Off Agreements. If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the\nLocal Media Group business, and in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments\nto the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement, which would require additional\nresources and management attention to complete. If the Merger and Spin-Off are not completed, Meredith cannot assure its shareholders that these risks\nwill not materialize and will not materially affect the business, financial results and stock price of Meredith.\nSee \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to the Closing of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 120.\nMeredith and Gray may not be able to obtain the required approvals from the FCC.\nMeredith\u2019s and Gray\u2019s obligation to complete the transaction is subject to obtaining FCC consent to the transfer of control of Meredith and the broadcast\nlicensee subsidiaries of Meredith in connection with the transaction and termination or expiration of any waiting period (and extension thereof) under the\nHSR Act.

To facilitate the receipt of such approvals, Gray divested its television broadcast station in the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City, Michigan DMA,\nWJRT-TV (the \u201cDivestiture\u201d). On October 8, 2021, the waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated. Although Meredith and Gray believe that they\nwill be able to obtain the required consent of the FCC they cannot be sure they will do so. Failure to obtain the required FCC consent would prevent\nMeredith and Gray from completing the transaction.\nOn June 14, 2021, Meredith and Gray each received a Second Request from the Antitrust Division, which defines the \u201cRelevant Area\u201d as the Flint-\nSaginaw-Bay City, Michigan DMA and the \u201cRelevant Product\u201d as \u201cthe sale of spot advertising time on broadcast television stations.\u201d The issuance of a\nSecond Request extends the waiting period until thirty calendar days after Meredith and Gray comply with the Second Request or until the Antitrust\nDivision terminates the waiting period. On July 14, 2021, Gray announced an agreement to divest its WJRT-TV station in the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City,\nMichigan DMA to Allen Media. On September 21, 2021, the Antitrust Division advised that it had no objections to Allen Media Group as the buyer of\nWJRT-TV. On September 23, 2021, Gray consummated the sale of WJRT-TV to Allen Media. As a result, Gray and Meredith no longer operate stations in\nthe same DMA. The Antitrust Division informed Meredith on September 28, 2021 that it has closed its investigation of the Merger, and on October 8,\n2021, the waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated.\nThe consummation of the Merger is conditioned on the Spin-Off, which requires certain financing conditions to be met, which may not be met in a\ntimely manner or at all.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, NMG SpinCo must make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith such that the net\ndebt of Meredith (exclusive of the NMG SpinCo debt and after\n38\nTable of Contents\ngiving effect to the SpinCo Cash Payment) would be equal to $1.975 billion (subject to certain adjustments, the amount of net debt agreed by Meredith\nand Gray to be allocated to Meredith in connection with the Separation and Spin-Off). The SpinCo Cash Payment is expected to be funded through the\nfollowing sources: available cash on hand (which will be taken into account in determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through\nborrowings under a new senior credit facility from the SpinCo Debt Financing or, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of\nthe Spin-Off and Merger, through funds advanced by Dotdash, in connection with the Dotdash Merger. If NMG SpinCo needs to consummate the\nSpinCo Debt Financing to pay the SpinCo Cash Payment and cannot consummate the SpinCo Debt Financing, the Merger cannot close. In the event Gray\nor Meredith is entitled to terminate, and elects to terminate, the Merger Agreement at the \u201cEnd Date\u201d (as defined in the Merger Agreement) prior to\ncompletion of the Merger and, at such time, all of the conditions to Meredith\u2019s obligation to consummate the Distribution, Spin-Off and Merger have\nbeen satisfied (other than the conditions that the SpinCo Debt Financing has been consummated and funded and that the SpinCo Cash Payment has\nbeen made), Meredith will be obligated to pay a termination fee to Gray in the amount of $73 million.\nIf the proposed Merger is not completed, our business could be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline.\nThe Merger is subject to closing conditions and may not be completed or may not be completed as quickly as expected. If the Merger Agreement is\nterminated, the market price of Meredith Common Stock will likely decline, as we believe that our market price reflects an assumption that the Merger will\nbe completed. For example, on April 30, 2021, the last full trading day prior to public announcement of the proposed Merger, shares of Meredith Common\nStock closed at $31.10 per share. On May 3, 2021, the first full trading day after the public announcement of the proposed Merger, shares of Meredith\nCommon Stock closed at $35.21 per share. On November 5, 2021, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, shares of\nMeredith Common Stock closed at $58.20 per share. In addition, our stock price may be adversely affected as a result of the fact that we have incurred\nand will continue to incur significant expenses related to the Merger and Dotdash Merger, a portion of which will not be recovered if the Merger is not\ncompleted. If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the Local Media Group business, and in the\nevent the Merger Agreement is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and\nthe Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement, which would create additional transaction related expenses. If the\nMerger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay Gray a termination fee of up to $113 million. As a consequence\nof the failure of the Merger to be completed, as well as of some or all of these potential effects of the termination of the Merger Agreement, our business\ncould be materially and adversely affected.\nThe existence of the pending Merger could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations.\nWhile the Merger is pending, advertisers and other sources of revenue may decide to delay, defer or cancel purchases of our products and/or services,\npending completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. If these decisions represent a significant portion of our anticipated revenue,\nour results of operations and quarterly revenues could be substantially below the expectations of market analysts.\nIn addition, while the Merger is pending, we are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations,\nincluding:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management and employee attention and the unavoidable disruption to our relationships with customers and vendors may\ndetract from our ability to grow revenues and minimize costs\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the Merger\u037e\n39\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe fact that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we must generally conduct our business in the ordinary course and we are subject to a\nvariety of other restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the Closing or termination of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\npreparation for the Dotdash Merger, which requires resources and management attention\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that we may be unable to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict Meredith\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the transaction and, in specified circumstances,\ncould require Meredith to pay to Gray a termination fee.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, Meredith is restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from soliciting, initiating, knowingly facilitating or negotiating, or\nfurnishing non-public information with regard to, any inquiry, proposal or offer for an alternative business combination transaction from any person.\nMeredith may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Company Proposal (as defined herein) only if\nspecified conditions have been satisfied, including a determination by the Board (after consultation with third party financial advisors and outside legal\ncounsel) that such proposal could be more favorable to the Meredith shareholders than the Merger from a financial point of view. A termination in this\ninstance would result in Meredith being required to pay Gray a fee of $113 million. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to the failure of\nMeredith to procure the requisite shareholder vote, Meredith will be required to pay Gray reimbursement of expenses up to $10 million. These provisions\ncould discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Meredith from considering or proposing an alternative\nbusiness combination transaction with Meredith, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the value of the\ntransaction. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d beginning on page 124.\nMeredith\u2019s executive officers and directors have interests in the transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Meredith\nshareholders generally.\nIn considering the unanimous recommendation of our Board to vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that the\nconsummation of the Merger will result in certain benefits to our directors and executive officers that are not available to our shareholders generally.\nMeredith\u2019s Board was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the Merger and in deciding to recommend that Meredith\nshareholders vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. These interests include:\n\u2022\ncontinued employment with NMG SpinCo or with Gray, as applicable\u037e\n\u2022\ncash out of certain equity awards\u037e\n\u2022\nreceipt of new NMG SpinCo equity awards\u037e and\n\u2022\neligibility to receive severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations.\nPlease see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 85 for a more detailed description of the\ninterests of Meredith\u2019s directors and executive officers.\nIf the Merger occurs, our shareholders will not be able to participate in any upside to our LMG business.\nUpon consummation of the Merger, our shareholders will receive $16.99 in cash per share, without interest and subject to applicable tax withholding, for\neach shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock owned by them, but will not receive any shares of Gray common stock. As a result, if\nour LMG segment performs well following the Merger, our current shareholders will not receive any additional consideration, and will therefore not\nreceive any benefit from the performance of the business.\n40\nTable of Contents\nIf the Merger occurs, the Distribution will generally be taxable to our shareholders.\nIf the Merger occurs, the receipt by our shareholders of shares of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock in the Distribution will\ngenerally be a taxable dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the NMG SpinCo Stock received to the extent of the shareholder\u2019s ratable\nshare of Meredith\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits, with the excess treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the\nshareholder\u2019s tax basis in shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable, and then as capital gain. For a more detailed\ndiscussion, see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution, the Merger and the Dotdash Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 95 for a more complete summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Distribution, the Merger and the\nDotdash Merger.\nMost shareholders holding Meredith Common Stock will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.\nAppraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable shareholders, in connection with certain mergers, to demand that the corporation\npay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in\nconnection with the merger. Under the IBCA and the organization documents of the Company, only shareholders holding Meredith Class B Stock are\nentitled to such appraisal rights.\nIn the event the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the Merger, NMG SpinCo may be unable to achieve some or all of the expected\nbenefits from its separation from Meredith.\nIn the event the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the Merger, NMG SpinCo will continue as a stand-alone, publicly traded company\nuntil consummation of the Dotdash Merger Agreement unless the Dotdash Merger Agreement is terminated earlier. As a new, publicly traded company,\nthe Company still believes that NMG SpinCo\u2019s business will benefit from, among other things, allowing its management to design and implement\nstrategies that are based primarily on the characteristics of its operating business, allowing NMG SpinCo to focus its time and financial resources wholly\non its own operations and implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet its own specific needs. NMG SpinCo may not be able to achieve\nsome or all of the benefits that it expects to achieve as a new operating company or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all for a variety of\nreasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe separation will require significant amounts of the NMG SpinCo management\u2019s time and effort, which may divert management\u2019s attention from\noperating and growing the business\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the Separation, NMG SpinCo may be more susceptible to economic downturns and other adverse events than if it was still a part of\nMeredith\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the Separation, the NMG SpinCo business will be less diversified than Meredith\u2019s business prior to the separation\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the Separation, the NMG SpinCo business will experience a loss of scale and access to certain financial, managerial, and professional\nresources as well as product and brand power influence and recognition with some customers from which Meredith has benefited in the past\u037e and\n\u2022\nactions required to separate the respective businesses could disrupt its operations.\nIf the Dotdash Merger does not occur and if NMG SpinCo were unable to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if\nsuch benefits are delayed, the NMG SpinCo business could be harmed and the value of NMG SpinCo shares that Meredith\u2019s shareholders receive as a\nresult of the transactions described herein could be harmed.\n41\nTable of Contents\nCAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",

Following the Separation, NMG SpinCo and\nits subsidiaries will own all of the NMG business segment and corporate functions, while Meredith (excluding NMG SpinCo and its subsidiaries) will own\nall of the LMG business segment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses).\nStep 2. SpinCo Cash Payment and Repayment of Meredith Debt.\nPrior to the Distribution, NMG SpinCo or one of its subsidiaries will make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith such that the net debt of Meredith\n(exclusive of any NMG SpinCo debt and after giving effect to the SpinCo Cash Payment) would be equal to $1.975 billion (subject to certain adjustments,\nthe amount of net debt agreed by Meredith and Gray to be allocated to Meredith in connection with the Separation and Spin-Off). The proceeds of the\nSpinCo Cash Payment, together with cash on hand of Meredith and borrowings by Gray, will be used to satisfy all of Meredith\u2019s outstanding long-term\ndebt as of the date of the Closing. The SpinCo Cash Payment is expected to be funded through the following sources: available cash on hand (which will\nbe taken into account in determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through borrowings under a new senior credit facility from the SpinCo\nDebt Financing (as defined below) or, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger, through funds\nadvanced by Dotdash, in connection with the Dotdash Merger.\nStep 3. Distribution and Spin-Off.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, following the Separation and immediately prior to the Merger, Meredith will\nconsummate the Spin-Off of NMG SpinCo by making the Distribution of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock to Meredith\nshareholders holding Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock, respectively, on a one-for-one basis such that NMG SpinCo will maintain\nMeredith\u2019s existing dual-class voting structure. Prior to completion of the Merger, Meredith will set the Distribution Record Date and a Distribution Date.\nMeredith expects such Distribution Date to be the same date as the date that the Merger is completed, but the Distribution Record Date will be an earlier\ndate.\nAfter the Distribution, if the Dotdash Merger is not consummated on the same day: the NMG SpinCo Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share\nwith respect to matters on which the NMG SpinCo shareholders are entitled to vote\u037e the NMG SpinCo Class B Stock will be entitled to ten votes per share\non such matters\u037e NMG SpinCo will be a standalone, publicly traded company owned 100% by the pre-merger Meredith shareholders\u037e and NMG SpinCo is\nexpected to the \u201cMeredith\u201d name and \u201cMDP\u201d ticker symbol.\n50Table of Contents\nStep 4. Merger.\nImmediately following completion of the Distribution, Merger Sub will merge with and into Meredith, with Meredith surviving the merger and becoming a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Gray (referred to herein as LMG RemainCo). As a result of the Merger, Gray will acquire our LMG business segment\n(excluding the MNI and People TV businesses). In the merger, each share of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the Closing will be converted into the right to receive $16.99 in cash, without interest and subject to all applicable tax\nwithholding. This cash will be in addition to the shares of NMG SpinCo that our shareholders will receive pursuant to the Distribution.\nDotdash Merger\nOn October 6, 2021, Meredith announced that the Company and NMG SpinCo have entered into the Dotdash Merger Agreement to sell NMG SpinCo to\nDotdash. Completion of the Dotdash Merger is not a condition to consummation of the Spin-Off and Merger, and for so long as the Merger Agreement is\nin effect, the Dotdash Merger will not, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, occur until after the Closing of the Merger. We currently expect the Dotdash\nMerger to be consummated on the same day as and following the consummation of the Spin-Off and the Merger, if the closing conditions for the Dotdash\nMerger have been satisfied or waived. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the Spin-Off and the Merger, NMG SpinCo will\ncontinue as a stand-alone, publicly traded company until consummation of the Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement, unless the\nDotdash Merger is terminated earlier. If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the LMG business,\nand, until the Dotdash Merger is completed, NMG, and in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate\ncertain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement.\nPursuant to the IBCA, Meredith shareholders are not required to vote on the Dotdash Merger and are not being asked to vote on the Dotdash Merger.\nThe Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board, by the board of NMG SpinCo and by the\nCompany, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is the only shareholder vote required for the\nDotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the consummation of the Dotdash Merger.\nIf the Dotdash Merger is completed, each holder of NMG SpinCo Stock will be entitled to receive $42.18 in cash, subject to downward adjustment as\nprovided in the Dotdash Merger Agreement, for each share of NMG SpinCo Stock. The cash payment received by NMG SpinCo shareholders will be in\naddition to the cash Merger Consideration that Meredith shareholders will receive if the Merger is completed.\nFor more information regarding the Dotdash Merger, the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the consideration that shareholders will receive in respect of\nthe shares of NMG SpinCo that will have previously been received by Meredith shareholders in the Spin-Off, see the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission on October 7, 2021.",

The\nBoard\u2019s decision to approve the Merger, as described in more detail below, was made prior to the Dotdash Merger opportunity. Accordingly, the reasons\nfor the Board\u2019s decision to recommend that shareholders approve the Merger, as set forth below, were developed before the Company\u2019s entry into the\nDotdash Merger. However, the Dotdash Merger does not alter the recommendation of our Board that shareholders approve the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement, as amended.\nIn its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transaction, our Board consulted with the Company\u2019s senior management as well as legal, regulatory\nand financial advisors to the Company, and considered a number of factors, which are discussed below. The following discussion of the information and\nfactors considered by our Board is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with the transaction\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, our Board did not consider it practicable to, nor did it attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights\nto the specific material factors it considered in reaching its decision. In addition, individual members of our Board may have given different weight to\ndifferent factors. Our Board considered this information and these factors as a whole and overall considered the relevant information and factors to be\nfavorable to, and in support of, its determinations and recommendations.\nIn the course of its deliberations, our Board considered the following substantive factors as being generally positive or favorable, each of which our\nBoard believed supported its unanimous decision to proceed with the Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby:\n\u2022\nthe potential for the transaction to unlock the significant embedded value in the Company\u2019s LMG business and assets, while providing the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders with what our Board believes will be a faster time table for realizing that value relative to continuing to pursue the\nLMG business plan combined with the NMG business or other strategic alternatives\u037e\n\u2022\nthe total consideration to be received by the Company\u2019s shareholders per share of the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B\nStock consisting of (a) $14.51 cash (as contemplated by the Merger Agreement executed on May 3, 2021), which provides the Company\u2019s\nshareholders with a significant fixed component of return and liquidity in the near term, and (b) one share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock or\nNMG SpinCo Class B Stock\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that NMG SpinCo would retain the Company\u2019s MNI business which historically has contributed almost $9 million of EBITDA\nannually\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief of our Board that the combined value of the merger consideration and the NMG SpinCo shares represents superior value to the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders when compared to other strategic alternatives\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the transaction represents a valuation of the Company\u2019s LMG business and assets at a multiple of 10.5x two-year average\nEBITDA\u037e\n\u2022\nour Board\u2019s understanding of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of the LMG business, as well as our\nBoard\u2019s belief that the incremental risk in the future of the LMG business had increased due to expected downward pressure on\nretransmission revenue as network and MVPD negotiations become more difficult and subscriber counts decline due to cord cutting,\nadvertising trends and uncertainties, regulatory changes and other factors\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that broadcast multiples had declined in the last three years and the pool of potential acquirors could continue to decrease due to\nindustry consolidation trends and the potential for increased regulatory constraints on ownership of television stations and other media\ninterests\u037e\n52\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Company\u2019s shareholders in the aggregate will own 100% of the fully diluted shares of NMG SpinCo, which would provide\nthe Company\u2019s shareholders with continuing participation in the NMG business and its potential growth\u037e\n\u2022\nthe favorable momentum and prospects of NMG as a stand-alone business, with digital growth offsetting print declines and the belief that\nmoving to report Digital and Magazine as separate segments would create greater clarity and unlock shareholder value as public markets\nwere not giving NMG enough value for its current business\u037e\n\u2022\nthe facts that NMG SpinCo will retain the \u201cMeredith\u201d name and continue to be headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, will retain the current\nvoting structure and be traded on NYSE, will continue to be led by Tom Harty as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and management will\nbe able to focus exclusively on the NMG portfolio and business\u037e\n\u2022\nthe structure of the transaction would allow NMG SpinCo to target 2.0x two-year average EBITDA as a long-term leverage goal to enable\nstrategic investments in growth platforms (digital, ecommerce, consumer) and return of some level of a cash dividend to attract value\ninvestors to NMG\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Company had obtained committed debt financing for NMG SpinCo and the limited number and nature of the conditions to\nthe debt financing\u037e\n\u2022\nour Board\u2019s belief that the Company had engaged in a fulsome review of strategic alternatives over the past 18 months, with the assistance\nof Moelis, which explored solicited and unsolicited interest in potential strategic transactions, including with those parties that were\nbelieved to be the most able and willing to transact\u037e\n\u2022\nour Board\u2019s belief that the Company had engaged in a fulsome process to obtain the best value reasonably available for the Company\u2019s\nshareholders and had created an opportunity for other potentially interested parties to negotiate a transaction with the Company if such\nparties were interested in a strategic transaction, and the Gray transaction presented the most favorable opportunity for the Company\u2019s\nshareholders on a risk-adjusted basis relative to the potential value that might result from other strategic alternatives available to the\nCompany given the potential rewards, risks and uncertainties associated with pursuing those other potential alternatives\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that this process, even after media reports about it, did not result in any proposals to acquire the Company or the LMG business\nthat our Board of directors believed were more likely to create greater certainty of value for the Company\u2019s shareholders than the spin-off\nand merger with Gray, taking into account risk of execution as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks, and in this regard,\nour Board considered the relative favorable and unfavorable aspects of the proposal made by Party D on April 29, 2021 prior to signing the\nMerger Agreement on May 3, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the consideration to be received for each share of the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B Stock and other terms\nof the Merger Agreement resulted from negotiations between the Company and its legal and financial advisors, on the one hand, and Gray\nand its legal and financial advisors, on the other hand, in regular consultation with our senior management and our Board, and our Board\u2019s\nbelief that the consideration to be received for each share of the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B Stock represented the\nhighest per share consideration that could be negotiated with Gray under the circumstances at that time\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the holders of the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B Stock will receive the same consideration per share\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger will be subject to a separate class vote of the holders of the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B\nStock, thereby providing each class of the Company shareholders the ability to separately approve or disapprove the transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nthe strong support of the transaction by shareholders representing a substantial majority of the Meredith Class B Stock, who have entered\ninto a support agreement with Gray to vote in favor of the Merger proposal\u037e\n53\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger consideration is fixed and will not fluctuate based upon changes in the market price of Gray\u2019s or the Company\u2019s\npublicly traded shares\u037e\n\u2022\nthe view of our Board that the transaction with Gray is likely to be consummated and is expected to close during calendar year 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Company is not expected to recognize U.S. federal income tax at the corporate level in connection with the spin-off of NMG\nor sale of LMG, thereby maximizing the value to the Company\u2019s shareholders after repayment of all of the Company\u2019s current debt\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Company would have been expected to recognize significant U.S. federal income tax at the corporate level in connection\nwith a direct sale of LMG by the Company in an asset sale transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential for U.S. federal income tax rates to increase under the current administration and Congress after closing, thereby potentially\nincreasing the tax benefit to the Company\u2019s shareholders of receiving a tax basis in the NMG SpinCo shares equal to their fair market value\nas of the closing and decreasing the tax benefit to the Company\u2019s shareholders of deferring the income tax liability on the NMG SpinCo\nshares received at closing\u037e\n\u2022\nthe opinion of Moelis delivered orally on May 3, 2021 at our Board meeting, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written\nopinion dated May 3, 2021, addressed to our Board, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the\nassumptions, qualifications, matters and limitations set forth in such opinion, the merger consideration of $14.51 per share in cash to be\nreceived by the holders of the Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock in the Merger (as contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement executed on May 3, 2021) is fair, from a financial point of view to such holders (other than the Excluded Holders), as more fully\ndescribed in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Meredith\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 77 and the full text of which is attached hereto as\nAnnex B\u037e\n\u2022\nthe financial condition and resources of Gray and the lack of any financing condition in the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Gray had obtained committed debt financing for the full amount of transaction payments (including the merger consideration\nand refinancing of the Company\u2019s existing indebtedness) and for the full term of the Merger Agreement (through August 3, 2022) from\nreputable commercial banks with significant experience in similar lending transactions and reputations for honoring the terms of their\ncommitment letters, the limited number and nature of the conditions to the debt financing (which are essentially co-extensive with the\nconditions to the Merger), which increases the likelihood of such financings being completed, and the obligation of Gray to use reasonable\nbest efforts to obtain the debt financing, and the obligation of Gray to pay the Company a $125 million reverse termination fee if the Merger\nfails to be consummated as a result of a financing failure\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger is not subject to approval by Gray stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Gray\u2019s obligations to close the Merger are subject to customary conditions, and our Board\u2019s belief that, while the closing of the\nMerger is subject to regulatory approvals from the FCC and DOJ, such approvals were not likely to prevent the closing of the Merger,\nespecially in light of the facts that Gray is a qualified purchaser with a long record of completing numerous television station acquisitions,\nGray\u2019s position as the proposed buyer could reasonably be expected to attract minor or no opposition at the FCC based on Gray\u2019s record in\nprior transactions, Gray management has a history of working constructively to satisfy regulatory requirements if needed, Gray would not\nneed any regulatory waivers, Gray\u2019s station portfolio has only one market overlap with LMG, and Gray has agreed to use reasonable best\nefforts, subject to certain limitations, to take all steps necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals, including committing proactively to\ndivest its Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station\u037e\n\u2022\nthe view of our Board that third parties would be unlikely to be deterred from making a competing proposal by the provisions of the Merger\nAgreement, including because our Board may, under certain\n54\nTable of Contents\ncircumstances, furnish information or enter into discussions in connection with a competing proposal. In this regard, our Board of directors\nconsidered that:\n\u2022\nour Board has the ability under the Merger Agreement to withdraw or modify its recommendation in favor of the approval of adoption\nof the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, including in connection with a superior proposal or certain intervening events,\nand has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances prior to the time that the Company\u2019s shareholders\napprove the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe structure of the transaction as a spin-off and merger should allow sufficient time for a third party to make a competing proposal if\nit desired to do so\u037e and\n\u2022\nwhile the Merger Agreement, prior to the amendment, contained a termination fee of $36 million that the Company would be required\nto pay Gray under certain circumstances, our Board believed that this fee and the circumstances when such termination fee may be\npayable, were reasonable in light of the potential benefit of the Merger, consistent with or lower than fees in comparable transactions\nat 1.33% of transaction value, and not preclusive of other offers\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the outside date of May 3, 2022 (which may be extended to August 3, 2022 under certain circumstances) under the Merger Agreement\nallows for sufficient time to complete the transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nthe view of the Board that the Gray transaction satisfies the \u201ccommunity interest factors\u201d set forth in Section 490.1108A of the IBCA,\nincluding our Board\u2019s belief that Gray has a long, successful record of operating television stations and will be a good steward for the LMG\nbusiness and employees and communities served by the LMG stations\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to request the Delaware Court of Chancery to specifically enforce the Merger Agreement, including with respect to\nthe debt financing commitments and the consummation of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which were the product of arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the parties,\ndescribed under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u201d beginning on page 103, which our Board, after consulting with the Company\u2019s legal and financial\nadvisors, considered to be reasonable and consistent with relevant precedents\u037e and\n\u2022\nthat the Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board of directors, which is comprised of a majority of independent directors\n(eight of nine) who are not employees of the Company (and none of whom are affiliated with Gray), and which retained and received advice\nfrom our financial and legal advisors in evaluating, negotiating and recommending the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Company\u2019s Board of directors was aware of and also considered the following risks and other factors concerning the Merger Agreement and the\ntransaction as generally negative or unfavorable:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Company\u2019s shareholders would no longer participate in any future earnings or growth of the LMG business and would not\nbenefit from any potential future appreciation in value of the LMG business\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the announcement and pendency of the transaction could result in the disruption of the Company\u2019s business, including the possible\ndiversion of management and employee attention from other strategic and operational priorities to focus on matters relevant to the\ntransaction, potential employee attrition and potential adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business relationships\u037e\n\u2022\nthe significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the Merger, the spin-off and the transactions contemplated\nthereby, and the substantial time and effort of management required to complete the transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nrisks that any shareholder litigation in connection with the transaction may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and\nliability\u037e\n55\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthat the Company is subject to restrictions under the Merger Agreement on the conduct of its LMG business prior to the consummation of\nthe transaction, requiring the Company to conduct its LMG business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, subject to\nspecified limitations, which may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise during the pendency\nof the transaction, whether or not the transaction is completed\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or that if the transaction is not completed, the Company may\nbe adversely affected due to potential disruptions in its operations and the trading price of the Meredith Common Stock may be adversely\naffected\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility that, while the transaction is expected to be completed, there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019\nobligations to complete the transaction, including shareholder approval by the Company shareholders, will be satisfied, and as a result, it is\npossible that the transaction may not be completed even if approved by the Company shareholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the reverse termination fee payable by Gray is not available in all instances where the Merger Agreement is not\nconsummated and may be the Company\u2019s only recourse where it is available\u037e\n\u2022\nif the Merger is not consummated, the spin-off of NMG will also not be consummated\u037e\n\u2022\nif the Merger is not consummated, the Company may be required to pay its own expenses associated with the Merger Agreement and\ntransactions contemplated thereby and, if the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of the failure to obtain approval of the Company\u2019s\nshareholders, the Company would be obligated to reimburse Gray for up to $10 million of its expenses in connection with the Merger\nAgreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility that Gray will be unable to obtain all or a portion of the debt financing proceeds contemplated by the debt commitment\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that NMG may not meet its financial projections and the possibility that the strategic, operational and financial benefits anticipated\nin connection with the transaction might not be realized by NMG SpinCo as a stand-alone company\u037e\n\u2022\nthat under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company is unable to solicit other competing proposals during the pendency of the\nMerger, including any revised proposals from Party D\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares pursuant to the Merger and the receipt of NMG SpinCo shares pursuant to the spin-\noff will be taxable transactions to the Company\u2019s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that under Iowa law the Company\u2019s common shareholders are not entitled to seek appraisal of the fair value of the shares of\ncommon stock.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s Board of directors was aware of and considered the interests that certain directors and executive officers may have with\nrespect to the transaction that differ from, or are in addition to, their interests as the Company shareholders, as described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of\nOur Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 85.\nOur Board believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the transaction to the Company and its shareholders outweighed the risks, many of which are\nmentioned above. Our Board realized, however, that there can be no assurance about future results, including results considered or expected as described\nin the factors listed above. The explanation of the reasoning of our Board and all other information in this section are forward-looking in nature and,\ntherefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under \u201cCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 42.\nAmendment to Merger Agreement\nAfter the Company received an unsolicited proposal from a third party after announcement of the Merger Agreement on May 3, 2021 (as further\ndescribed in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d beginning on\n56\nTable of Contents\npage 58), the Company and Gray began negotiations regarding a potential amendment to the Merger Agreement, which subsequently resulted in an\namendment executed on June 2, 2021. At its meeting on June 1, 2021, the Company\u2019s Board of directors unanimously (a) determined that the amended\nMerger Agreement (as amended by the amendment executed on June 2, 2021) and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are\nadvisable, (b) determined that the amended Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, taken together, are at a\nprice and on terms that are fair to, and in the best interest of the Company, taking into consideration the effect on the Company\u2019s shareholders as well as\nthe effect on certain of the other community interests set forth in Section 490.1108A of the IBCA, (c) approved the execution, delivery and performance by\nthe Company of the amended Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and (d) resolved\nto recommend that the shareholders of the Company approve the adoption of the amended Merger Agreement and thereby the Merger.\nIn its evaluation of the amended Merger Agreement and the transaction, our Board consulted with the Company\u2019s senior management as well as legal and\nfinancial advisors to the Company, and considered a number of factors, including the factors discussed above and below, which our Board believed\nsupported its unanimous decision to proceed with the amended Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the amended Merger Agreement increased the total consideration to be received by the Company\u2019s shareholders per share of\nthe Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B Stock from $14.51 cash to $16.99 cash (an increase of more than 17%)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe facts that revised merger consideration of $16.99 per share in cash in the amended Merger Agreement was an increase from the original\nmerger consideration of $14.51 per share in cash and that Moelis had previously rendered its written opinion, dated as of May 3, 2021, to the\nBoard that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, matters and limitations set forth therein, the\noriginal merger consideration of $14.51 per share in cash to be received by the holders of the Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B\nStock (other than the Excluded Holders) in the Merger was fair from a financial point of view to such holders (other than the Excluded\nHolders) (see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Meredith\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 77 and the full text of which\nis attached hereto as Annex B)\u037e\n\u2022\nour Board\u2019s belief that the increased merger consideration in the amendment constituted Gray\u2019s best and final offer and represented the\nhighest per share consideration that could be negotiated with Gray under the circumstances at that time\u037e\n\u2022\nafter reviewing the relative favorable and unfavorable aspects of the Gray proposal and the proposal made by Party D on May 26, 2021, our\nBoard\u2019s belief that the Gray transaction continued to present the most favorable opportunity for the Company\u2019s shareholders on a risk-\nadjusted basis taking into account certainty of value, regulatory considerations, path to closing, expected timing and other factors\u037e\n\u2022\nwhile the amended Merger Agreement contains a break fee of $113 million that the Company would be required to pay Gray under certain\ncircumstances, our Board\u2019s belief that Gray would not have agreed to the increased merger consideration without the Company\u2019s\nacceptance of this fee and that the break fee and the circumstances when such fee may be payable, were reasonable in light of the increased\nmerger consideration negotiated with Gray, were consistent with fees in comparable transactions at 4% of transaction value, and were not\npreclusive of other offers\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the amended Merger Agreement does not contain the \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision or the station purchase option initially\nproposed by Gray as a condition for the increased merger consideration\u037e\n\u2022\nwhile the amended Merger Agreement contains a termination fee of $73 million that the Company would be required to pay Gray if the\nclosing is not consummated in certain circumstances as a result of NMG SpinCo\u2019s inability to obtain the its debt financing, our Board\u2019s\nbelief that Gray would not have\n57\nTable of Contents\nagreed to the increased merger consideration without the Company\u2019s acceptance of this fee, that the termination fee and the circumstances\nwhen such fee may be payable, were reasonable in light of the increased merger consideration negotiated with Gray, that the Company had\nfully committed financing mitigated the risk that such fee would become payable, and that Gray\u2019s corresponding termination fee was $125\nmillion.\nBackground of the Merger",

        "Background of the Merger": {
            "text": "Background of the Merger\nIn the ordinary course of business, our Board and our senior management actively review strategic alternatives that might be available to enhance\nshareholder value and engage in discussions with other companies in the television broadcasting, digital media, and publishing industries concerning\npossible strategic transactions, acquisitions of businesses and brands, commercial collaborations, and joint ventures.\nAs a result of these reviews, on January 31, 2018, the Company acquired Time, Inc. to create the leading multi-platform media company, to accelerate the\nCompany\u2019s digital position by adding significant scale, and to provide advertising and consumer revenue diversification and growth.\nEffective February 1, 2018, our Board appointed Tom Harty as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\nOver the next two years, the Company focused on the integration of the core brands and titles acquired in the Time Inc. acquisition and completed the\ndivestiture of non-core assets (including the TIME, FORTUNE and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED brands and the Company\u2019s investments in Viant and Xumo)\nto focus on brands serving its core audience of American women.\nIn Fall 2019, the Company had preliminary discussions with a few private equity firms regarding possible strategic transactions, but the discussions did\nnot advance beyond preliminary discussions and no transactions resulted.\nDuring the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 crisis created an extremely challenging business environment for the Company and our industry as a whole,\nincluding significant advertising campaign cancellations and delays. On April 2, 2020, the closing price of the Company\u2019s shares fell to a 52-week low of\n$10.81. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company focused on proactively taking aggressive actions to strengthen the Company\u2019s liquidity\nand enhance the Company\u2019s financial flexibility. Among other actions, the Company paused its common stock dividend, implemented a series of\noperational cost-control measures, reduced capital expenditures and worked with customers and suppliers to optimize working capital.\nIn May 2020, our Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss strategic options for our LMG business segment, including the potential sale of select\nbroadcast stations and a potential sale of all of LMG. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis also participated in the meeting.\nThe select station group included the stations in St. Louis, Missouri (DMA #23), Mobile, Alabama-Pensacola, Florida (DMA #57), Flint-Saginaw-Bay\nCity, Michigan (DMA #77), and Springfield-Holyoke, Massachusetts (DMA #111)). Our management expected the comparatively high tax basis of this\nstation group to maximize after-tax proceeds to pay down the Company\u2019s debt and reduce leverage. Representatives of Moelis discussed the potential for\nstrong demand for the entire LMG station group given the number of parties who were interested in expanding their television station holdings prior to\nthe onset of COVID-19 and highlighted the potential for interested buyers of the select stations to pursue a transaction for all of LMG. Our senior\nmanagement and representatives of Moelis reviewed an illustrative timeline and key workstreams that would be required for a sale of LMG and a\nconcurrent separation of our NMG business segment.\nWhile focusing on the COVID-related business impact and challenges, our Board and senior management continued to evaluate additional actions it\ncould take to strengthen the Company\u2019s liquidity and enhance its financial flexibility. In June 2020, the Company used the net proceeds from an offering\nof senior secured notes and incremental term loans to redeem in full the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock and lower its overall cost of capital.\n58Table of Contents\nSubsequent to the May 2020 Board meeting, the Company formally engaged Moelis to begin preparations for marketing the select station group after\nLabor Day 2020 depending on market conditions. In order to preserve the option of pursuing a sale of LMG in the event potential buyers expanded\nconversations beyond the four stations, Moelis and the Company\u2019s primary outside legal counsel Cooley LLP (\u201cCooley\u201d) also continued analysis and\npreparations for a potential divestiture of LMG and a spin-off of NMG. Our Board requested Moelis\u2019 assistance based on the Company\u2019s longstanding\nrelationship with Moelis, as well as Moelis\u2019 extensive expertise and experience advising media companies in connection with potential strategic\ntransactions. Both Moelis and Cooley had advised the Company and our Board on a number of our prior strategic transactions (including the Time Inc.\nacquisition) and had been advising the Company in connection with the Company\u2019s ongoing review of long-term strategic alternatives.\nAfter a thorough review of various potential transaction structures, we determined that a spin-off of NMG SpinCo (holding the Company\u2019s NMG\nbusiness segment and corporate functions) into an independent, publicly traded company, with a simultaneous sale of LMG RemainCo (the Meredith\nCorporation legal entity then owning the LMG segment only) in a stock transaction would be the most tax-efficient structure while balancing other\nbusiness and legal considerations. Given the Company\u2019s comparatively higher tax basis in the legacy Time Inc. entities, a spin-off of the NMG business\nand assets was expected to result in no or very limited corporate level tax. By contrast, a sale of LMG in a direct asset sale by the Company was expected\nto result in significant corporate level tax based on the Company\u2019s comparatively lower tax basis in the LMG business and assets. Our management and\nadvisors also began to evaluate the desired capital structure of a pro forma stand-alone NMG SpinCo.\nIn July 2020, our Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss two strategic initiatives. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis\nand Cooley also participated. Representatives of Moelis and Cooley provided our Board with an update on the potential select station sale process.\nRepresentatives of Cooley introduced a potential amendment to the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation. The proposed amendment would fix a technical\nissue and clarify the Company\u2019s ability to execute a separation of LMG and NMG in a tax-efficient manner and preserve the Company\u2019s existing voting\nstructure in a stand-alone NMG SpinCo. Specifically, the proposed amendment would clarify the Company\u2019s ability to make distributions to the holders of\nthe Company\u2019s common stock and class B stock in separate classes of capital stock of a spin-off subsidiary in order to preserve the voting rights\ncurrently held by both classes of shareholders in a stand-alone NMG SpinCo.\nOn August 10 and 11, 2020, our Board held its regular quarterly meeting. Members of our senior management also participated. Our Board decided to\nmove forward with the amendment to the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation for formal consideration at a subsequent Board meeting. Our Board also\nconsidered the optimal timing for the select station sale process relative to the potential amendment and discussed a potential sale of LMG.\nOn August 24, 2020, our Board held a telephonic meeting to consider the amendment further. Members of our senior management and representatives of\nMoelis and Cooley also participated. Our Board formally approved the proposed amendment to the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation subject to\nshareholder approval at the annual shareholders meeting scheduled to be held in November 2020. Our Board decided to seek the amendment ahead of\ncommencing any strategic transaction and, accordingly, determined to wait to commence marketing the select station sale until after the November annual\nshareholders meeting.\nOn September 9, 2020, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC to submit the amendment proposal to a vote of the Company\u2019s\nshareholders at the annual meeting scheduled for November 11, 2020, and the Company subsequently filed the definitive proxy statement with the SEC on\nSeptember 25, 2020.\nOn November 10, 2020, our Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the television broadcast industry, and an overview, analysis and considerations\nfor the select station sale process. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis also participated. Representatives of Moelis\npresented our Board with\n59\nTable of Contents\nmarket data and financial information regarding the potential select station sales. Our Board considered certain key benefits that could be provided by the\ndivestitures, including the ability to delever the Company\u2019s balance sheet by selling high tax basis assets, the high probability of success given the\nquality of assets, improving station performance coming out of COVID-19 and strong political advertising revenue, the potential to eliminate regulatory\noverlaps with potential future buyers of LMG, and the expectation that the select divestitures should have no negative impact on the appeal of a larger\nLMG transaction. Subsequent to the meeting, our Board authorized our senior management and advisors to move forward with the marketing of the select\nstation sales, to commence buyer outreach and solicit initial indications of interest.\nOn November 11, 2020, at the Company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting, the Company\u2019s shareholders approved the proposed amendment to the\nCompany\u2019s articles of incorporation as described above.\nCommencing November 16, 2020 and over the next several weeks, representatives of Moelis contacted 20 parties (including Gray) and several expressed\ninterest in certain of the select stations and potentially all four. The contacted parties included all of the publicly-traded broadcasters (including Gray) as\nwell as other broadcasters and broadcast investors considered most likely to have potential interest. The Company entered into confidentiality\nagreements with 17 parties (including Gray) who had expressed interest in a transaction with the Company. The confidentiality agreements contained\ncustomary standstill and fall-away provisions. The counterparties were invited to review preliminary financial and due diligence information regarding the\nfour select stations and submit preliminary indications of interest by December 17, 2020.\nOn December 21, 2020, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis also participated in the\nmeeting. Representatives of Moelis provided current perspectives on the television broadcast industry and an update on the select station sale process.\nRepresentatives of Moelis noted the continued strong recovery in pacings and record political advertising generated by the 2020 election races.\nRepresentatives of Moelis also noted that overall M&A activity was recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted by the Scripps\u2014ION Media\nmerger announced in September and the recent launch of another process to sell a television broadcaster\u2019s station portfolio. Representatives of Moelis\nreported to our Board that, of the 20 parties contacted, four submitted first round bids. Two parties bid for all four stations: a strategic party referred to as\nParty A, and a private equity sponsor which had acquired a station group and spoken with the Company in Fall 2019, referred to as Party B. Another\nstrategic party, referred to as Party C, bid on the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station only. An investment firm with a portfolio company that currently owned a\nsmall station group, referred to as Party D, bid on the Mobile- Pensacola and Flint-Saginaw-Bay City stations. Gray did not submit a proposal for only the\nselect four station group at this time. Overall, the four bids indicated a total value range of $511-$631 million for the four station group.\nIn addition, Gray, Party A and Party B indicated interest in potentially acquiring LMG in a stock transaction after a simultaneous spin-off of NMG, with an\nindicative enterprise value range of $2.5-$2.8 billion. Gray indicated a value range of $2.5-$2.7 billion in an all cash transaction. Party A indicated a value\nrange of $2.6-$2.8 billion. Party B indicated a value range of $2.5-$2.75 billion in a combination of cash and stock to be determined. All of the proposals\nwere non-binding and subject to customary diligence review and third-party debt financing.\nSubsequent to the meeting, our Board instructed our senior management and advisors to provide select, value-driving information to parties who\nexpressed interest in a LMG transaction while proceeding with the next phase of the select station process. Each of the parties that submitted first round\nproposals for the select stations was invited to participate in the second round and granted full data room access. Over the next several weeks, the\nCompany and Moelis addressed the parties\u2019 diligence questions and scheduled diligence calls with our LMG management team.\nOn January 12, 2021, on behalf of, and at the direction of, the Company, representatives of Moelis invited Gray, Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D to\nsubmit final offers for the select station group no later than\n60\nTable of Contents\nJanuary 25, 2021. The parties were asked to submit markups of a proposed asset purchase agreement with their final bids. At the direction of the\nCompany, representatives of Moelis also invited Gray, Party A and Party B to submit proposals to acquire LMG by the same date.\nPending receipt of final bids for the select station group, the Company\u2019s management and advisors continued to analyze a potential sale of LMG and\nsimultaneous spin-off of NMG. This included consideration of the tax and shareholder value implications, a transaction timetable and key workstreams,\nlegal and operational issues associated with separating the businesses and allocating assets and liabilities and employee plans and arrangements,\npotential costs associated with refinancing the Company\u2019s debt, potential change in control triggers under employee plans and arrangements, and the\ncapital structure and financing requirements for NMG SpinCo.\nOn January 21, 2021, the Company received preliminary markups of the asset purchase agreement from Gray, Party A, Party C and Party D. Party B did not\nsubmit a markup on this date. On January 23, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of Moelis provided preliminary feedback to Gray,\nParty A, Party C and Party D on certain of the provisions included in their markups which, if addressed, could make their final bids more competitive and\nin line with markups received from other parties. In particular, Moelis communicated that adding closing conditionality and post-closing indemnification\nobligations would be negatively viewed and put bids at a competitive disadvantage.\nOn January 25 and 26, 2021, the Company received five (including one from Gray) final indications of interest for the select stations and two (including\none from Gray) revised preliminary indications of interest for LMG.\nGray proposed to purchase the select station group (other than the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station) for $425 million in cash as a first step in acquiring\nLMG immediately following a spin-off of NMG. Gray proposed to purchase for cash all of the stock of LMG RemainCo based on an enterprise value of\n$2.6-$2.7 billion and certain other assumptions (an increase from its prior low end range of $2.5 billion). Gray\u2019s proposal contemplated the divestiture of\nMeredith\u2019s Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station, WNEM, to address FCC rules that would prohibit Gray from owning both stations in the market. Gray\nindicated that it was prepared to move forward with the acquisition of LMG RemainCo on a public-company deal basis, that is with no survival of the\nrepresentations and warranties regarding LMG RemainCo. Gray indicated that it would finance the LMG RemainCo acquisition with a combination of cash\non hand and new debt and that its final proposal for a LMG RemainCo acquisition would not have any financing contingencies. Gray\u2019s proposals to\nacquire the select station group and LMG were subject to completion of certain due diligence items and agreement on acceptable contract terms.\nParty A proposed to purchase all four stations of the select station group for $560 million in cash and pledged to provide executed debt financing\ncommitment letters from lenders shortly thereafter.\nParty B proposed to purchase the select station group for $510 million in cash. Additionally, Party B reconfirmed its interest in acquiring LMG RemainCo\nin a cash/stock transaction based on an enterprise value of $2.5-$2.7 billion (a reduction from its prior high end range of $2.75 billion). Party B planned to\nfinance the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, new equity and new debt. Party B did not submit a markup of the asset purchase agreement,\nand its proposal was subject to completion of due diligence and agreement on contract terms. Party B expressed an interest in having the Company\u2019s\nshareholders retain an ownership interest in LMG RemainCo in order for LMG RemainCo to remain a public company after the sale.\nParty C proposed to acquire the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station for $63 million in cash, subject to completion of final confirmatory due diligence.\nParty D proposed to acquire the Mobile-Pensacola station for $61 million in cash or both the Mobile-Pensacola and Flint-Saginaw-Bay City stations for\n$146 million in cash. Party D\u2019s offer was subject to\n61\nTable of Contents\ncompletion of confirmatory due diligence and agreement on contract terms. Party D indicated that it expected to have sufficient funds available so that its\nfinal offer would not be subject to any financing contingency.\nOn January 28, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis also participated.\nRepresentatives of Moelis reviewed the current stock price performance of pure-play broadcasters and its current views on the M&A environment.\nMoelis also updated our Board on the final bids for the select station group. The highest value combination from the bids received represented $583\nmillion. Representatives of Moelis also updated our Board on the Gray and Party B proposals to acquire LMG RemainCo.\nAt this meeting, members of the Company\u2019s senior management also reviewed with our Board an overview of potential scenarios to provide optionality\nfor debt paydown, resumption of a dividend and earnings growth (including a case assuming no strategic transaction, a case assuming the sale of the\nselect station group, and a case assuming a sale of LMG). Our senior management also reviewed with our Board an overview of illustrative shareholder\nvalue over time under the various cases, taking into account illustrative share prices, projected dividends, and cash merger consideration from the sale of\nLMG, based on various cash flow, trading multiple and other assumptions. Our senior management also reviewed with our Board an overview of the\ncapital allocation implications of the various cases based on various debt pay-down, dividend and cash generation assumptions. Our senior management\nalso reviewed with our Board an updated three-year outlook based on post-COVID recovery and other assumptions and discussed the prospects and\nexecution risks of the NMG business on a stand-alone basis and the prospects and execution risks of the LMG business based on the Company\u2019s\nperformance and macro-industry factors.\nAfter full discussion and based on current values being indicated by potential acquirors, our Board decided to pause the select station sale process at\nthat time and instructed our senior management and advisors to focus their efforts on advancing preparations and discussions for a potential LMG sale\nand spin-off of NMG. Our senior management and Board also determined that it would be advisable to convene recurring special meetings going forward\nin order for our senior management and advisors to provide frequent updates to our Board regarding the status of a potential transaction opportunity and\nrelated preparations and discussions.\nOn February 1, 2021, Gray announced its acquisition of Quincy Media, Inc. and its television station group for $925 million in cash.\nOn February 5, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Moelis also\nparticipated. At this meeting, our senior management reviewed several factors weighing in favor of a transaction for LMG: the number of viable buyers\nwould become smaller as consolidation continues across the broadcast industry (noting the Gray-Quincy transaction)\u037e with the change in presidential\nadministration, the future FCC regulatory outlook could be more limiting for a LMG transaction\u037e the prospect of higher tax rates could negatively impact\nthe Company and shareholders\u037e and executing a sale of LMG would materially reduce the Company\u2019s debt, thus providing capacity for investment in the\nNMG business. Moelis provided an update on the Gray-Quincy transaction and the status of discussions with potential counterparties regarding a LMG\ntransaction. Representatives of a consulting firm with expertise in the media, entertainment and communications industries also participated in part of the\nmeeting and provided its perspectives on the current broadcast landscape for 2021.\nDuring the month of February, the Company\u2019s management, Moelis and Cooley continued to analyze and advance a transaction timetable and key\nworkstreams involved in a potential sale of LMG and a spin-off of NMG. The Company continued to advance conversations with potential lenders\nregarding NMG SpinCo\u2019s capital structure and indicative debt financing terms. Our management and advisors also continued work on a data room and\ndiligence process for a sale of LMG with the potential bidders and prepared drafts of definitive agreements for a spin-off and sale transaction to be shared\nwith potential bidders in an auction process. The Company and Moelis also agreed on a transaction fee for a LMG sale and formally amended their\nengagement letter accordingly.\n62\nTable of Contents\nOn February 12, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also\nparticipated. Representatives of Moelis provided an update on the sale process and diligence activity by Gray and Party B and their advisors and\npotential lenders. Moelis noted that Party B had indicated that it needed additional time to further review possible transaction structures and the\ncash/stock consideration mix. Representatives of Moelis also reviewed the transaction structure and steps for an illustrative spin-off of NMG and sale of\nLMG from a financial point of view. Representatives of Cooley reviewed with our Board certain legal matters including our directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in\nconnection with its consideration of a potential strategic transaction involving a spin-off of NMG and sale of LMG. Representatives of Moelis and\nCooley also reviewed with our Board an updated illustrative timeline for the various workstreams to signing for a spin-off and sale transaction.\nOn February 19, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley\nalso participated. Representatives of Moelis led a discussion of an illustrative timeline for soliciting and processing final bids from LMG bidders. Our\nsenior management led a discussion through various scenarios including ranges for longer term LMG valuation if the Company were to continue to\npursue its combined NMG-LMG business plan, ranges for a potential one-time transaction payment if the Company were to complete a sale of LMG, and\nillustrative capital structures for NMG SpinCo and capacity for future investment and dividends if the Company were to separate NMG from LMG.\nOn February 26, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley\nalso participated. Our senior management led a discussion that included a preliminary investor relations and communications plan around a potential\nspin-off and sale transaction and a new Meredith company focused exclusively on our National Media Group.\nAlso on February 26, 2021, and again on March 5, 2021, representatives of Moelis and Cooley spoke with representatives of Party B and its advisors to\ndiscuss various aspects of structuring the sale transaction. Also on March 5, Deloitte Tax LLP (\u201cDeloitte\u201d), tax advisors to the Company, spoke with\nrepresentatives of Party B and its accountants to discuss the NMG-LMG separation steps in more detail.\nOn March 11, 2021, the Company received a written non-binding letter of interest from Party D to acquire LMG in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction\ninvolving the spin-off of LMG (rather than NMG) and simultaneous combination of the LMG stations with stations owned by the Party D portfolio\ncompany and additional stations from a party subsequently identified as a publicly-traded broadcaster referred to herein as Party E. Party D\u2019s proposal\nincluded $2.5 billion of cash consideration (to refinance the Company\u2019s debt and make a cash dividend to the Company\u2019s shareholders) and a 50.7%\nownership interest for the Company\u2019s existing shareholders in the new combined company. The proposal indicated that the new combined company\nwould initially have a total net leverage of 6.75x pro forma EBITDA. Party D indicated its belief that the Company\u2019s shareholders would only be taxed at\nclosing on the cash dividend received, with any income tax on the value of the NMG SpinCo shares received in the spin-off distribution and the stock\nreceived in the new combined company being deferred until a future taxable event. The proposal was subject to completion of diligence and reverse\ndiligence to confirm synergies.\nOn March 15, 2021, representatives of Moelis and Cooley reviewed Party D\u2019s proposal with the Company\u2019s senior management. They discussed the\npotential benefits and considerations of the proposal, including the indicated tax treatment, the consideration mix, that the stock ownership would be in a\nhighly-levered company, and that it introduced a higher degree of complexity, requiring a spin-off of LMG rather than NMG and making the transaction\nconditional on the consummation of a separate, third-party transaction.\nOn March 16, 2021, as directed by the Company, Moelis granted Party D access to a limited data room to finalize its indication of interest.\nOn March 17, 2021, on behalf of, and at the direction of, the Company, representatives of Moelis provided process letters to Gray and Party B and invited\nthem to submit final offers for LMG no later than April 14, 2021.\n63\nTable of Contents\nRepresentatives of Moelis also provided drafts of the proposed Merger Agreement and Separation and Distribution Agreement. The parties were asked\nto submit markups by April 1, 2021 prior to their final bids. Among other terms, the proposed agreements included (1) customary exceptions to the \u201cno\nshop\u201d covenant to permit our Board to consider unsolicited alternative proposals consistent with its fiduciary duties, (2) the right of our Board to change\nits recommendation and terminate the agreements in certain circumstances relating to acceptance of a superior proposal, subject to payment to the\nacquiror of a break fee equal to 3% of the transaction value paid to the Company\u2019s shareholders, (3) customary matching rights for the acquiror, (4)\nrequirements for the acquiror to take certain specified actions to obtain regulatory approvals, (5) the right of the parties to extend the end date of the\nagreements to up to 15 months from signing if necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, (6) requirements for the acquiror to deliver fully committed\nfinancing at signing and take certain specified actions to obtain its third-party financing by the scheduled closing date, (7) a requirement for the acquiror\nto pay a reverse termination fee of $125 million if the transaction were terminated due to the acquiror\u2019s breach or a failure of the acquiror\u2019s financing to be\nfunded, (8) a public-style deal for the sale of LMG RemainCo without the survival of representations and warranties, (9) the acquisition of the Company\u2019s\nMNI business by the acquiror as an asset of LMG RemainCo, (10) the assumption by NMG SpinCo of liabilities associated with the NMG business\nsegment and Corporate functions and the retention by LMG RemainCo of liabilities associated with the LMG business segment, subject to certain\nexceptions and mutual indemnities, (11) conditionality of the LMG sale transaction on the consummation of the spin-off of NMG and the consummation\nof the funding of the NMG SpinCo debt financing, (12) the allocation of the Company\u2019s debt between NMG SpinCo and LMG RemainCo by providing\nthat NMG SpinCo would borrow new funds at closing and make a cash payment to LMG RemainCo such that the net debt of LMG RemainCo (after giving\neffect to the cash payment) would be equal to an amount to be agreed by the parties before signing, and (13) a cash merger payment to the Company\u2019s\nshareholders in the amount of the total purchase price less the amount of net debt allocated to LMG RemainCo.\nOn March 19, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also\nparticipated. Representatives of Moelis provided an update on the increase in trading multiples in the broadcast industry. Representatives of Moelis also\nprovided an update on the LMG sale process and the proposal received from Party D. The Board asked questions about the proposal, and the discussion\nnoted that additional information and analysis would be required to fully evaluate the parties, structure, timing, regulatory implications, and potential\nmarket reaction to the ownership interest to be retained by the Company\u2019s shareholders in the new combined company, among other aspects of the\nproposal.\nOn March 20, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of Moelis provided drafts of the proposed Merger Agreement schedules, Tax\nMatters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement to Gray and Party B. At the direction of the Company, representatives of Moelis provided a draft\nof the proposed Employee Matters Agreement to Gray and Party B on March 25, 2021.\nPending receipt of final bids, the Company and advisors continued to work with Gray and Party B to address diligence questions and responses. Our\nmanagement and advisors also continued to analyze the Reverse Morris Trust transaction structure proposed by Party D, including the tax and\nregulatory implications, as well as consider a realistic timetable for a transaction with Party D based on their later start, the additional transaction\ncomplexity, and the need for the Company to perform due diligence on Party D\u2019s business. This \u201creverse\u201d diligence was necessary because Party D\u2019s\nproposal contemplated the Company shareholders holding shares in a new combined company.\nOn March 23, 2021, Party B communicated that it intended to submit an all-cash bid after completing its analysis of structure and other elements of the\ntransaction.\nOn March 30, 2021, on behalf of, and at the direction of, the Company, representatives of Moelis provided drafts of all of the transaction agreements to\nParty D. Subject to further discussions regarding transaction structure, the drafts provided for the spin-off of NMG as contemplated by the drafts\npreviously shared with Gray and Party B and provided for an all-cash merger. Representatives of Moelis invited Party D to mark the\n64\nTable of Contents\nagreements to reflect its final structure proposal and requested markups by April 8, 2021. On March 31, 2021, at the direction of the Company, Moelis\nprovided to Party D an illustrative transaction structure reflecting the Company\u2019s preference for a spin-off of NMG rather than LMG. Moelis also\nprovided a list of high priority due diligence requests, which would enable the Company to perform reverse diligence on Party D\u2019s business.\nOn April 2, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also\nparticipated and reviewed with our Board the status of the key transaction workstreams for the spin-off and sale, and an illustrative timeline for the next\nstages of a transaction. Also on April 2, Gray\u2019s legal advisors, Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP (\u201cEversheds\u201d), submitted markups of each of the\ntransaction agreements on behalf of Gray. Also on April 2, Party D\u2019s legal advisors submitted a revised transaction structure proposal.\nLater that day, April 2, 2021, representatives of Moelis and Cooley participated on a call with legal counsel for Party D and discussed a Morris Trust\ntransaction structure involving the spin-off of NMG that would make Party D\u2019s proposal more attractive to the Company.\nOn April 7, 2021, representatives of Cooley and Moelis reviewed a preliminary list of business and legal issues presented by Gray\u2019s markups of the\ntransaction agreements with members of our senior management. Among other items, they noted certain provisions that would need to be negotiated if\nthe Company were to move forward with a potential transaction with Gray, including (1) how debt and certain liabilities would be allocated between NMG\nSpinCo and LMG RemainCo, (2) Gray\u2019s proposal not to acquire or pay for the Company\u2019s MNI business, (3) certain provisions that could affect closing\ntiming and certainty, (4) certain provisions that would negatively affect our Board\u2019s ability to consider unsolicited proposals after signing, including\nchanges to the definition of superior proposal, an increase of the break fee payable by the Company to 5% of the transaction value paid to the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders, and the addition of an option for Gray to purchase certain stations at an economic discount upon the Company\u2019s acceptance of\na competing proposal\u037e and (5) a reduction of the reverse termination fee payable by Gray in certain events from $125 million to 5% of the transaction value\npaid to the Company\u2019s shareholders.\nAlso on April 7, representatives of Deloitte, Moelis and Cooley spoke again with Party D\u2019s legal advisors to discuss aspects of the separation, spin-off\nand merger transactions structure and steps.\nOn April 8, 2021, Party D\u2019s legal advisors submitted a markup of the Merger Agreement on behalf of Party D, but did not provide markups of any of the\nother transaction agreements. The markup of the Merger Agreement was subject to completion of diligence and transaction structure and Party D\u2019s\nfinancing structure and commitment letters. Among other comments, Party D indicated the $125 million reverse termination fee would be reduced but did\nnot include a counter proposal.\nOn April 9, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also\nparticipated. This meeting focused on a business update from our senior management and further discussion regarding the business rationale and\ncommunications plan for the separation and spin-off of NMG and sale of LMG.\nOn April 11, 2021, representatives of Cooley and Moelis spoke with representatives of Gray\u2019s legal advisors, Eversheds, and financial advisors, Wells\nFargo Securities LLC (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), to provide feedback on behalf of the Company in advance of Gray\u2019s final bid regarding certain business and legal\nissues presented by Gray\u2019s initial markups of the transaction agreements and to discuss certain diligence-related matters.\nOn April 12, 2021, representatives of Cooley and Eversheds spoke further regarding certain legal matters under the transaction agreements in advance of\nGray\u2019s final bid.\n65\nTable of Contents\nOn April 13, 2021, Party D\u2019s legal advisors submitted a revised transaction structure proposal that reflected a Morris Trust transaction involving the spin-\noff of NMG and the sale of LMG RemainCo. The proposal also reflected that Party E would be contributing television stations to the new combined\ncompany in exchange for an ownership interest rather than selling the stations to the new company for cash.\nOn April 14, 2021, Gray submitted a proposal to purchase all of the stock of LMG RemainCo for cash based on an enterprise value of $2.45 billion (a\ndecrease from its prior range of $2.6-$2.7 billion). Gray\u2019s proposal continued to exclude the Company\u2019s MNI business (which would be retained by NMG\nSpinCo). Gray\u2019s proposal was supported by debt financing commitment letters from lenders. Gray confirmed it had completed substantive diligence and\ncommitted to divest its Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station to address regulatory requirements. Gray\u2019s proposal was accompanied by the same markups of the\ntransaction agreements which it had previously provided on April 2, 2021.\nOn April 14, 2021, Party B also submitted a proposal to purchase all of the stock of LMG RemainCo for cash based on an enterprise value of $2.3 billion (a\ndecrease from its prior range of $2.5-$2.7 billion). Under Party B\u2019s proposal, Party B would acquire the Company\u2019s MNI business as an asset of LMG\nRemainCo. Party B submitted a markup of the Merger Agreement and an issues list for the other transaction agreements. Party B\u2019s proposal was\nsupported by debt financing commitment letters from lenders. Party B confirmed it had completed substantive diligence and, to address regulatory\nrequirements, Party B committed to divest a station in the one overlap market presented by the proposed transaction.\nOn April 15, 2021, Party D submitted a proposal for a Morris Trust transaction reflecting $2.5 billion in cash consideration (to refinance the Company\u2019s\ndebt and make a cash dividend to the Company\u2019s shareholders) and a 50.8% ownership interest for the Company\u2019s shareholders in the new combined\ncompany. Under Party D\u2019s proposal, Party D would acquire the Company\u2019s MNI business as an asset of LMG RemainCo. Party D reconfirmed its belief\nthat the receipt of stock of NMG SpinCo in the spin-off distribution and receipt of stock of the new combined company in the merger transaction would\nnot be taxable to the Company\u2019s shareholders at closing. The proposed financing included $2.050 billion of debt financing and $570 million of equity\nfinancing in the form of junior capital or preferred stock, representing a total net leverage for the new combined company of 7.0x two-year average\n2019/2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including the preferred financing. Party D submitted \u201chighly confident\u201d letters from its proposed lenders but\nindicated it would need up to three weeks to obtain fully committed financing. The proposal did not include commitments for the equity financing. Party\nD also indicated that it was still in the process of negotiating with Party E. Party D did not provide any further markups of the transaction agreements\nbeyond the markup of the Merger Agreement previously submitted on April 8, 2021.\nOn April 16, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also\nparticipated and reviewed each of the proposals with our Board, as well as potential responses and next steps for each party. After discussion of the key\nterms, benefits and drawbacks of each proposal and how they compared to each other, our Board determined that none of the proposals were adequate\nbased on their current terms. Among other considerations, the discussion focused on certainty of value and the amount of cash payable to the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders, path to closing and expected timing, perspectives on the value and monetization of the MNI business if retained by NMG\nSpinCo, and the regulatory implications and increased possibility of delay of a transaction with Party D and Party E given the additional scrutiny a\ntransaction with these parties would likely face from the FCC and interest groups based on the complexity of their proposal, their ownership interests in\nother broadcasters and broadcast assets, and their track records in prior transactions.\nAfter discussion, our Board instructed representatives of Moelis to communicate to Gray and Party B that they would need to increase their value\nproposals significantly and address other contract terms if they desired to be successful in potentially acquiring LMG and ask them to resubmit\nproposals by April 20, 2021. Our Board also instructed the Company\u2019s advisors to continue to analyze Party D\u2019s proposal, including the value and reverse\n66\nTable of Contents\ndiligence elements and regulatory implications, and continue their work to validate the indicated tax treatment and tax opinions. Our Board also instructed\nrepresentatives of Moelis to communicate to Party D that it would need to advance its proposal to catch up with the other parties, deliver firm financing\ncommitments, increase the cash component and clarify certain elements of value and sources and uses, and address certain regulatory questions and\nconcerns. Later that day, representatives of Moelis spoke separately with representatives of Gray, Party B and Party D to communicate the messages\ndiscussed at the Board meeting.\nOn April 18, 2021, representatives of Moelis provided to Gray and Party B a quarterly update on the LMG business and a list of certain items that would\nneed to be addressed in a revised bid, including matters relating to the retention of certain liabilities by LMG RemainCo, closing timing and certainty,\ncertain deal protection and fiduciary out elements, including the amount of the break fee payable to the acquiror in the event the Company accepts a\nsuperior proposal, and the amount of the reverse termination fee payable to the Company in the event of a breach or financing failure by the acquiror.\nOn April 19, 2021, Gray submitted a revised proposal for $2.65 billion in cash (up from $2.45 billion and still based on NMG SpinCo retaining the MNI\nbusiness). Gray confirmed its view that it would obtain all approvals required for closing expeditiously and would close in calendar year 2021. Gray\nreduced the break fee payable by the Company under certain circumstances to $36 million and agreed to pay the $125 million reverse termination fee if the\ntransaction were terminated due to Gray\u2019s breach or a failure of Gray\u2019s financing. Gray also provided revised financing commitments for the full increased\npurchase price.\nOn April 20, 2021, Party B submitted a revised proposal for $2.33 billion in cash (up from $2.3 billion). The proposal was otherwise materially unchanged\nfrom its April 14, 2021 proposal (including that Party B would be acquiring the MNI business).\nOn April 21, 2021, representatives of Cooley spoke with Party D\u2019s regulatory counsel to discuss specific questions our senior management and advisors\nhad about the regulatory implications of Party D\u2019s proposal, and how Party D planned to comply with FCC regulatory requirements and obtain FCC\nconsent for the transaction and Party D\u2019s assessment of the time required to obtain such consent.\nOn April 22, 2021, a Moelis representative met with a principal of Party D. The principal expressed Party D\u2019s continuing interest in a transaction with the\nCompany. The Moelis representative communicated that Party D should put its best offer forward and indicated that the Company continued to have\nquestions regarding the total cash and stock value of the proposal and continued to have concerns regarding Party D\u2019s financing and regulatory timing\nand closing certainty. The principal suggested that Party D may be willing to agree to a regulatory break fee or ticking fee in the event of a regulatory\nfailure or delay. Later that day, the Party D principal communicated to the Moelis representative that it was working to improve its offer.\nOn April 23, 2021, Party D submitted a revised Morris Trust proposal providing for $2.56 billion cash consideration (up from $2.50 billion, to refinance the\nCompany\u2019s debt and make a cash dividend to the Company\u2019s shareholders) and 50.8% of the combined equity in the new combined company to be held\nby the Company\u2019s shareholders. The proposal was otherwise materially unchanged from its April 15, 2021 proposal (including that Party D would be\nacquiring the MNI business).\nOn April 23, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also\nparticipated. Our senior management reviewed the current state of the LMG business and senior management\u2019s perspectives on the go forward risks for\nthe LMG business. Representatives of Moelis and Cooley reviewed the key economic and contract terms of each current proposal (Gray\u2019s revised April\n19, 2021 proposal, Party B\u2019s revised April 20 proposal, and Party D\u2019s April 23, 2021 proposal). The discussion included a comparison of the key elements\nof each proposal, including certainty of value, their respective regulatory profiles, path to close and timing. The discussion also included the implications\nof NMG SpinCo retaining the MNI business, perspectives on how the equity in the combined company under\n67\nTable of Contents\nParty D\u2019s proposal could be valued and trade, the potential benefits to the Company\u2019s shareholders of tax deferral versus a stepped-up tax basis in the\nNMG SpinCo shares, and community interests such as employees.\nOur Board discussed in detail the perspective of our senior management and advisors that, while a potential Gray transaction could reasonably be\nexpected to obtain relatively prompt regulatory approvals and ultimately be consummated prior to the end of 2021, a transaction with Party D and Party E\npresented greater regulatory complexity and potential for opposition leading to the possibility of significant delay in the review and approval process,\nincreasing the risk of pushing closing into 2022. Key considerations with respect to Gray included (1) the comparatively clean regulatory profile of the\nGray transaction, with only one market overlap in Flint-Saginaw-Bay City and no requirement for any regulatory waivers, (2) Gray\u2019s long record of\ncompleting numerous television station acquisitions, (3) a reasonable chance that Gray\u2019s FCC applications would not be opposed, and (4) Gray\u2019s senior\nmanagement\u2019s record of working constructively to satisfy regulatory requirements. With respect to Party D\u2019s proposal, our Board considered the\nrelatively higher regulatory risk arising from (1) the greater regulatory complexity of the transaction involving Party D and Party E, (2) the higher risk that\nParty D\u2019s or Party E\u2019s FCC applications would be opposed, resulting in increased scrutiny by the FCC and delay, particularly as a result of Party E\u2019s\ndisclosed participation in the transaction, (3) the negative record of Party E with the FCC with respect to certain compliance matters\u037e (4) prior expressions\nof concern by current FCC leadership about Party E, and (5) Party D\u2019s proposed contractual allocation of regulatory risk, which merely matched the\nregulatory efforts provisions in the proposed Gray Merger Agreement. Our Board also considered the fact that Party E had not provided a formal\nproposal on a regulatory break fee which would be payable by Party E if regulatory approval were not obtained.\nOur senior management and advisors also reviewed with our Board potential responses to the proposals. After discussion, our Board determined that\nGray\u2019s proposal was stronger than the other proposals in terms of value and other key elements. Our Board also considered that Gray was likely weeks\nahead of Party D in its ability to execute a transaction and that limited progress had been made with Party D on the transaction agreements. Our Board\nalso discussed and considered Moelis\u2019 view that, in light of the concerns previously discussed by our Board, it was uncertain that Party D would be able\nto deliver an executable transaction on the same timeline as Gray, that delaying a possible transaction with Gray to advance Party D\u2019s various\nworkstreams may cause Gray to withdraw its proposal, and that our Board could evaluate, consistent with its fiduciary duties, a proposal that Party D\nmight submit after the Company entered into a transaction with Gray subject to certain procedures and provisions of the Merger Agreement.\nFollowing that portion of the meeting, the Company\u2019s advisors left the meeting and our senior management reviewed the economic value of the bids and\ncompared the total value to shareholders presented by each current proposal. Our Board authorized senior management and our advisors to go back to\nGray with a short list of critical deal points that would require Gray\u2019s acceptance as a condition to moving forward and working to fully negotiate\nagreements. The critical deal points included: a $50 million increase in cash consideration\u037e confirmation that all diligence was complete\u037e confirmation that\nGray would be in a position to sign definitive agreements within a week\u037e and assurances that regulatory and other approvals and financing would not\ndelay closing. Our Board authorized representatives of Moelis to communicate to Party B that its current proposal was not competitive. Our Board\nauthorized senior management and our advisors to work to continue to develop Party D\u2019s proposal, advance diligence and reverse due diligence, and\nevaluate any revisions to the prior proposal that may be submitted by Party D.\nSubsequent to our Board meeting, a Moelis representative spoke with Hilton Howell, the Chief Executive Officer of Gray. In that discussion, Gray agreed\nto the $50 million consideration increase (for a total enterprise valuation of LMG of $2.7 billion) and accepted the other critical deal points as a condition\nto moving forward.\nOn April 25 and 26, 2021, representatives of Cooley provided revised drafts of the transaction agreements to Eversheds to reflect the current deal terms\nand input from our senior management and Board on other terms and conditions. Representatives of Cooley also provided comments on Gray\u2019s financing\ncommitment papers. Over\n68\nTable of Contents\nthe course of the next week, representatives of Cooley and Eversheds continued to exchange revised drafts of the transaction agreements and had\nregular calls to discuss the status of the agreements and related schedules and to negotiate the final terms of the agreements on behalf of the Company\nand Gray.\nOn April 26, 2021, Party D submitted a revised proposal. The revised proposal continued to contemplate a Morris Trust transaction and provided for $2.66\nbillion cash consideration (increased from $2.56 billion, to refinance the Company\u2019s debt and make a cash dividend to the Company\u2019s shareholders) and a\n50.2% continuing ownership interest for the Company\u2019s shareholders in the new combined company. Party D\u2019s price continued to include the acquisition\nof the MNI business. Party D also reconfirmed its belief that the receipt of stock of NMG SpinCo in the spin-off distribution and receipt of stock of the\ncombined company in the merger transaction would not be taxable to the Company\u2019s shareholders at closing. This proposal included $2.58 billion of debt\nfinancing sources and $200 million of other unspecified financing sources, representing a total net leverage for the new combined company of 7.25x two-\nyear average 2019/2020 EBITDA, including the preferred financing. For the first time the proposal included a $100 million regulatory break fee payable to\nthe Company in the event of a regulatory failure.\nOn April 27, 2021, Party D\u2019s legal advisors submitted a revised markup of the Merger Agreement to reflect a Morris Trust transaction structure. The\nrevised markup continued to be subject to completion of diligence and transaction structure and final financing commitments. Among other comments,\nthe revised markup (1) added closing conditions related to the delivery of tax opinions and the prior closing of the contribution of stations by Party E, (2)\nprovided that the Merger Agreement would terminate in nine months if the closing had not occurred (in contrast to the 15 months under the proposed\nGray agreement), (3) provided that the $100 million regulatory break fee would be payable by the broadcast portfolio company of Party D with limited\nassets (without direct recourse to Party D or Party E), and (3) did not state a position on the amount of the break fee payable by the Company or the\nreverse termination fee payable by Party D in certain events. Party D did not submit markups of the other transaction agreements and did not submit firm\nfinancing commitments. The Company gave permission for Party D to speak to an equity financing source affiliated with Party B.\nOn April 28, 2021, representatives of Cooley provided a draft voting agreement to Eversheds that certain class B shareholders of the Company were\nprepared to execute in response to Gray\u2019s condition in its April 2, 2021 markups that certain shareholders of the Company agree to vote in favor of the\nMerger.\nAlso on April 28, 2021, representatives of Moelis and Cooley spoke further with Party D\u2019s legal and tax advisors regarding the tax structure of the\ntransaction and certain elements of the tax requirements for tax-deferred treatment and tax opinions.\nOn April 29, 2021, Party D submitted a revised proposal. The revised proposal continued to contemplate a spin-off of the NMG business and included an\nalternative to increase the cash consideration from $2.66 billion to $2.76 billion with a reduction of the ownership interest in the new combined company\nfor the Company\u2019s shareholders from 50.2% to 34%. Party D\u2019s proposal continued to include the acquisition of the MNI business. Party D reconfirmed its\nbelief that the receipt of stock of NMG SpinCo in the spin-off distribution and receipt of stock of the combined company in the merger transaction would\nnot be taxable to the Company\u2019s shareholders at closing. The financing sources included $2.58 billion of debt and $275 million of new preferred capital,\nrepresenting a total net leverage for the new combined company of 7.27x two-year average 2019/2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including the preferred\nfinancing. The proposal indicated that Party D was having conversations with additional financing sources. The proposal included draft debt\ncommitment papers that were characterized as \u201cnear final\u201d and a one-page non-binding indicative term sheet for a preferred stock investment by an\naffiliate of Party B that was subject to further negotiation. On May 1, 2021, Party D submitted a letter to the Company\u2019s senior management team and\nBoard advocating for Party D\u2019s proposal. On May 1, 2021, Party D\u2019s legal advisors communicated to representatives of Cooley that they would have\nmarkups of the other transaction agreements soon, however, such markups were not provided before signing of the definitive agreements with Gray.\n69\nTable of Contents\nOn May 1, 2021 and May 2, 2021, the Company and Gray and their advisors continued to negotiate the final terms of the transaction agreements. During\nthis period, the parties agreed that LMG RemainCo would be allocated $1.975 billion of the Company\u2019s net debt at closing so that the total cash payment\nto shareholders in the Merger would equal $725 million (or $14.51 per share subject to adjustment based on changes to the final share count).\nLater during the day on May 2, our Board also held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley\nalso participated. Moelis reviewed the financial aspects of the all cash proposal from Gray and the financial aspects of the current cash-stock proposal\nfrom Party D and led a discussion with our Board through a comparison of the economic and other key aspects of the two potential transactions.\nRepresentatives of Moelis noted that the transaction agreements with Gray were almost fully negotiated and could be executed as soon as the next day.\nThe Moelis representatives further noted that a potential transaction with Party D, Party E and an affiliate of Party B was not actionable on a similar\ntimeline as a transaction with Gray, and was subject to completing confirmatory diligence and reverse diligence by the Company, subject to receiving firm\nfinancing commitments and subject to negotiating final transaction agreements. Representatives of Moelis provided their perspectives on potential\nmarket reaction to the new combined company under Party D\u2019s proposal. Our Board expressed the importance of certainty of value, the regulatory\nconsiderations, the closing path and expected timing. Our Board asked questions about the certainty of closing and timing of closing under the two\npotential deals and how much more time it would take to negotiate a deal with Party D and Party E and the risk of losing the Gray deal. Representatives of\nCooley reviewed the regulatory considerations for both potential transactions, including the greater complexity and materially higher risk of opposition,\nscrutiny and delay for the transaction involving Party D and Party E. Our senior management and advisors reviewed with our Board the fact that the Gray\nMerger Agreement included a break fee payable by the Company of only $36 million and would not preclude Party D from submitting an unsolicited\nproposal after signing a deal with Gray, and subject to certain procedures and provisions of the Merger Agreement would allow our Board to consider a\nnew proposal consistent with its fiduciary duties.\nRepresentatives of Cooley reviewed again our Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in the context of considering the proposed separation, spin-off and sale\ntransactions. Representatives of Cooley also reviewed the material terms and conditions of the transaction agreements negotiated with Gray, including (1)\nthe structure of the separation, spin-off and merger transactions, (2) the allocation of assets and liabilities between NMG SpinCo and LMG RemainCo, (3)\nthe tax treatment of the transactions to the Company and shareholders, (4) NMG SpinCo\u2019s capitalization, (5) the treatment of the Company\u2019s employees\nand their equity awards, (6) the financing transaction commitments, (6) the closing conditions to consummating the spin-off and merger, (7) the\nCompany\u2019s rights and obligations in connection with considering unsolicited alternative proposals received after signing, including the Board\u2019s rights to\nchange its recommendation and terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal subject to payment of a $36 million break fee, and (8) the\ntermination provisions that bound Gray to seek to consummate the transaction for up to 15 months and required Gray to pay a $125 million reverse\ntermination fee if Gray failed to close the transaction in breach of the agreements. Our Board asked questions and discussed the proposed Gray\ntransaction and related risks. Our senior management reviewed with our Board the key terms of NMG SpinCo\u2019s financing commitment. Representatives of\nMoelis reviewed with our Board its financial analysis of the merger consideration in connection with its fairness analysis of the Gray transaction. Prior to\nthe meeting, representatives of Moelis had provided certain information regarding Moelis\u2019 material investment banking relationships with Gray and other\ncounterparties during the prior two-year period, and our Board determined that Moelis did not have any disqualifying conflicts of interest in serving as\nfinancial advisor to the Company and providing a fairness opinion in connection with any potential transaction with Gray.\nFollowing these board meetings, the Company and Gray continued to negotiate to finalize the transaction agreements and related schedules.\nDuring the early morning of May 3, 2021, members of our senior management and representatives of Cooley spoke with members of Gray\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Eversheds to discuss and\n70\nTable of Contents\nresolve the final open issues under the transaction agreements. Later that morning before market open, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of\nour senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also participated and confirmed that the transaction agreements with Gray were fully\nnegotiated with no material changes to the terms reviewed with our Board on the previous day. Representatives of Moelis confirmed that the final cash\nmerger consideration was $14.51 per share based on the final share count as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Representatives of Moelis reviewed its\nfinal financial analysis of the merger consideration and rendered to our Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written\nopinion, dated as of May 3, 2021, that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, the merger consideration of $14.51 per share in cash to be received by the holders of the\nMeredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock (other than the Excluded Holders) in the Merger (as contemplated by the Merger Agreement\nexecuted on May 3, 2021) was fair from a financial point of view to such holders (other than the Excluded Holders). For a more detailed discussion of\nMoelis\u2019 opinion, please see below under the caption \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Meredith\u2019s Financial Advisor.\u201d The opinion of Moelis is attached to this\nproxy statement as Annex B. Based on our Board\u2019s consideration of the factors in favor of and against the proposed transaction with Gray, including\nvarious factors that our Board had considered and weighed throughout the process, including the factors described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Reasons for the\nMerger,\u201d our Board unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement (as executed on May 3, 2021) and the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding the Merger, are advisable, (b) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, taken\ntogether, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best interest of the Company, taking into consideration the effect on the Company\u2019s\nshareholders as well as the effect on certain of the other community interests set forth in Section 490.1108A of the IBCA, (c) approved the execution,\ndelivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, and (d) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and thereby the Merger.\nAlso early on the morning of May 3, Gray\u2019s board of directors met and unanimously approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other\ntransaction agreements and transactions.\nFollowing our and Gray\u2019s Board meetings, the definitive Merger Agreement was executed by authorized officers of the Company, Gray and Merger Sub.\nThe definitive Separation and Distribution Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement were\nalso executed by authorized officers of the Company, NMG SpinCo and Gray. The definitive Voting Agreement was executed by authorized officers of\nGray and the shareholders of the Company party thereto.\nImmediately prior to public announcement, a Moelis representative spoke with a principal of Party D to communicate that the Company would be\nannouncing a transaction with another party and that the Company would be required to terminate discussions with all other parties subject to the terms\nof the definitive Merger Agreement.\nExecution of the Merger Agreement and other transaction agreements was publicly announced on the morning of May 3, 2021 before market open.\nOn May 13, 2021, Party D sent a letter addressed to our senior management and our Board making an unsolicited, non-binding proposal to acquire LMG\nRemainCo. The letter proposed $2.76 billion of cash consideration ($2.724 billion after payment of the $36 million break fee payable to Gray under the\nMerger Agreement) and reduced the ownership interest of the Company\u2019s shareholders in the new combined company compared to Party D\u2019s April 29,\n2021 proposal from 34% to 19%. The proposal implied a $750 million cash dividend to the Company\u2019s shareholders (based on the $1.975 billion closing net\ndebt target agreed to with Gray), or $14.99 per share (reduced from $15.71 per share in Party D\u2019s April 29, 2021 proposal). Under this new proposal, the\nCompany\u2019s MNI business would be retained by NMG SpinCo as in the Gray transaction. Party D now planned to acquire three additional stations from\nParty E to replace the MNI cash flow. The financing\n71\nTable of Contents\nsources included $2.58 billion of debt and $300 million of new preferred capital (including warrants for 12.5% of the fully diluted equity), representing a\nnet leverage ratio of 7.33x two-year average 2019/2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including the preferred financing. The proposal included a signed\ndebt commitment letter that expired nine months after signing (in contrast to the 15 months under the Gray transaction). The preferred financing\ncommitment from an affiliate of Party B was unsigned, in draft form and contingent upon further diligence. The proposal also contemplated a $75 million\ncash investment by Party D. The equity commitment letter was unsigned and in draft form. Party D also submitted markups of the definitive transaction\nagreements executed by the Company and Gray. Party D accepted the form and substance of the Gray agreements in principle, adjusted for transaction\nand tax structure. Party D reconfirmed its belief that the receipt of NMG SpinCo shares in the spin-off distribution and receipt of shares in the new\ncombined company in the merger transaction would not be taxable to the Company\u2019s shareholders at closing.\nOn May 14, 2021, a Moelis representative spoke with a principal of Party D to acknowledge receipt of the proposal and explain the review process in\naccordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. The principal of Party D indicated verbally that Party D was also working on an alternative structure\nthat would include additional stations, reduce the preferred financing, and enable Party D to further increase the amount of the cash dividend to the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders.\nOn May 14, 2021, the Company and Gray submitted regulatory filings to the FCC and DOJ for approval of the transaction.\nOn May 16, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also participated.\nRepresentatives of Moelis updated our Board regarding the call with Party D. Representatives of Moelis and Cooley reviewed the terms of Party D\u2019s\nproposal, and representatives of Cooley discussed certain legal matters relating to the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties and the Company\u2019s obligations under the\nMerger Agreement with respect to receiving and considering the unsolicited proposal, including the contractual and fiduciary determination our Board\nwould be required to make in order to permit the Company to negotiate the proposal with Party D consistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nDuring the discussion, representatives of Moelis provided its views on the proposed financing structure and terms and valuation considerations of the\nnew combined company.\nOur senior management discussed the tax treatment of the proposed transaction to the Company and shareholders as compared to the Gray transaction.\nThey discussed the potential value of the tax deferral on the value of the NMG SpinCo shares as compared to the potential value of obtaining a stepped\nup tax basis in the shares at closing in the context of possible changes to prevailing tax rates and the payment of future dividends by NMG SpinCo. Our\nadvisors noted that additional information and analysis would be required to reach a definitive conclusion on the tax treatment of the Party D transaction\nand associated tax opinions.\nOur regulatory advisors presented their perspectives on the regulatory considerations. Our regulatory advisors noted that the Company and Gray had\nsubmitted their regulatory filings to the FCC and DOJ and believed there was a high probability that the Gray transaction would receive all regulatory\napprovals by early December of 2021. Our regulatory advisors continued to believe that, relative to the Gray transaction, the regulatory profile of the\ntransaction involving Party D and Party E involved greater regulatory complexity and presented materially higher risk of regulatory opposition, scrutiny\nand delay, which increased the risk of closing in 2022 for all the reasons previously discussed with our Board. Our regulatory advisors noted that more\ninformation and analysis would be required to confirm that the proposed preferred stock investment by an affiliate of Party B would not raise additional\nregulatory issues. Our senior management and advisors provided their perspective that the proposed regulatory break fee of $100 million would not\nadequately compensate the Company for a failed transaction and that the break fee was only recourse to the broadcast portfolio company of Party D with\nlimited assets, so that the break fee as currently structured may not provide the desired incentives for Party D and Party E to resolve any potential\nregulatory issues.\n72\nTable of Contents\nOur senior management and advisors discussed potential responses and next steps with our Board. Our Board instructed our advisors to notify Gray of\nthe proposal in accordance with the Company\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement. After discussion, our Board decided to meet again later in the\nweek to consider the Party D proposal further after our advisors sought clarification regarding certain aspects of the proposal in accordance with the\nMerger Agreement and after Gray was notified of the proposal.\nOn May 17, 2021, a Moelis representative spoke to Mr. Howell, the Chief Executive Officer of Gray, to inform him of Party D\u2019s proposal. Later that day, at\nthe direction of the Company, representatives of Moelis provided a written summary of the material terms of the proposal to Mr. Howell in accordance\nwith the Merger Agreement. Representatives of Cooley also provided the written summary to representatives of Eversheds. Later that day,\nrepresentatives of Cooley spoke with representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day, legal advisors to Gray (\u201cJones Day\u201d). The representatives of\nEversheds and Jones Day asked questions about the structure and certain other elements of the proposal. After discussion, representatives of Cooley\ninvited them to submit a list of follow-up questions that may facilitate Gray\u2019s evaluation of the proposal. Representatives of Cooley also informed them\nthat the Company was planning to convene a Board meeting on May 21, 2021 to consider the proposal further.\nOn May 18, 2021, a Moelis representative spoke with a principal of Party D to provide an update on the status of the Company\u2019s review of the proposal.\nOn May 19, 2021, representatives of Cooley spoke again with representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day regarding the proposal. Subsequent to the\ncall, representatives of Eversheds submitted a list of follow-up questions regarding the Party D proposal. Also on this day, at the direction of the\nCompany, representatives of Moelis submitted a list of questions to Party D to clarify certain aspects of the proposal as permitted by the Merger\nAgreement. Representatives of Moelis also spoke with representatives of Wells Fargo, financial advisors to Gray, regarding the status of the Company\u2019s\nreview of Party D\u2019s proposal.\nOn May 20, 2021, representatives of Moelis, Cooley and Deloitte spoke with members of Party D senior management and representatives of Party D\u2019s\nlegal advisors, who provided responses to the clarifying questions submitted on the previous day.\nOn May 21, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also participated.\nRepresentatives of Moelis reviewed with the Board the interactions with Party D and Gray since receipt of Party D\u2019s proposal on May 13, 2021.\nRepresentatives of Moelis also reviewed the status of Party D\u2019s proposal based on Party D\u2019s responses to the clarifying questions. Representatives of\nCooley led a discussion of fiduciary and legal considerations relating to consideration of the proposal, and representatives of Moelis led a discussion of\npotential enhancements that could make the proposal more attractive to the Company, and potential responses and next steps. Our Board deliberated on\nwhether the proposal under the terms of the Merger Agreement \u201cis or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal\u201d in light of\nthe current status and terms of the proposal and Party D\u2019s verbal indications that it was working on an alternative structure that would enable Party D to\nenhance its proposal further. After discussion, our Board determined to meet again to deliberate further on the proposal and consider any revised\nproposals that may be forthcoming from either party. Our Board instructed representatives of Moelis to communicate with Party D and Gray regarding the\nstatus of our Board\u2019s deliberations.\nLater that day, a Moelis representative spoke to Mr. Howell and a representative of Wells Fargo to update them on the status of our Board\u2019s deliberations.\nRepresentatives of Cooley also spoke with representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day to provide them an update. A Moelis representative also\ncommunicated to the principal of Party D that our Board had met but no formal conclusions were made. The Party D principal communicated that a\npossible submission of an enhanced proposal could be forthcoming in the coming week.\nOn May 22, 2021, representatives of Cooley provided to Eversheds and Jones Day additional information regarding Party D\u2019s proposal in response to the\nquestions previously submitted by representatives of Eversheds.\n73\nTable of Contents\nOn May 25, 2021, Mr. Howell communicated to a representative of Moelis that a revised proposal would be forthcoming from Gray. Later that day, Gray\nsent a letter addressed to our Board proposing to increase the cash merger payment to the Company\u2019s shareholders to $15.25 per share (an increase from\n$14.51 per share and representing an aggregate enterprise value increase of $37 million to $2.737 billion). In exchange for the price increase, Gray\nproposed to increase the termination fee payable by the Company under specified circumstances under the Merger Agreement from $36 million to $73\nmillion and added a so-called \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision that would require the Company to submit the Gray transaction to a shareholder vote even if our\nBoard changed its recommendation in response to a superior proposal. The letter noted Gray\u2019s belief that its deal was \u201cfar superior\u201d to the Party D\nproposal and highlighted the progress the parties had made toward closing, the clearer regulatory path, and the progress Gray was making on the Flint-\nSaginaw-Bay City divestiture. Gray\u2019s letter indicated that the offer would expire on June 1, 2021.\nLater that day, a representative of Wells Fargo spoke with a representative of Moelis regarding the proposal. Representatives of Eversheds and Jones\nDay also spoke with representatives of Cooley to provide additional background on the terms of Gray\u2019s proposal. Representatives of Eversheds also\nconfirmed that the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City divestiture process had advanced to the second round with fully qualified bidders and that Gray expected the\ndivestiture agreement could be signed and filed with the FCC during the month of June 2021.\nLater that day, our senior management spoke with representatives of Moelis and Cooley regarding the Gray proposal.\nOn the evening of May 26, 2021, Party D sent a letter addressed to our senior management and our Board with a revised unsolicited, non-binding\nproposal to acquire LMG RemainCo. Compared to the prior proposal, the revised proposal increased the cash dividend to the Company\u2019s shareholders by\n$76 million (after payment of the $36 million break fee that would be due Gray) and reduced the ownership interest of the Company\u2019s shareholders in the\nnew combined company from 19% to 10%. The revised proposal implied an $825 million aggregate cash dividend to the Company\u2019s shareholders (based\non the $1.975 billion closing net debt target agreed to with Gray), or $16.51 per share. The revised proposal contemplated the contribution of four\ntelevision stations from Party B in exchange for common stock warrants. The letter stated that the contribution of the Party B stations would unlock\nadditional retransmission revenue synergies and provide additional cash flow. The financing sources included $2.863 billion of debt and $136 million of\nnew preferred capital, representing a net leverage ratio of 6.5x two-year average 2019/2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including the preferred financing.\nThe proposal included a signed debt commitment letter (delivered the next day), which expired after nine months (in contrast to the 15 months under the\nGray transaction). Under the revised proposal, the preferred financing would be provided by Party D rather than an affiliate of Party B. The proposal did\nnot include an updated commitment letter for the preferred financing. Party D reconfirmed its belief that the receipt of NMG SpinCo shares in the spin-off\ndistribution and receipt of shares in the new combined company in the merger transaction would not be taxable to the Company\u2019s shareholders at closing.\nOn May 27, 2021, representatives of Moelis and Cooley reviewed Party D\u2019s revised proposal with our senior management. Later that day, a Moelis\nrepresentative spoke with Mr. Howell to inform him of Party D\u2019s revised proposal and inform him that our Board was inclined to view Party D\u2019s revised\nproposal as one that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal\u201d. Mr. Howell indicated that Gray had flexibility to improve its\nproposal and was prepared to negotiate a potential amendment to the transaction agreements over the holiday weekend. After the call, at the instruction\nof the Company and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, the Moelis representative shared a written summary of the material terms of Party D\u2019s\nnew proposal with Mr. Howell. Representatives of Cooley also provided the summary to representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day. A principal of Party\nD also contacted a representative of Moelis, who reported to the principal that our Board was scheduled to meet the next day.\nLater on May 27, 2021, Party D provided the updated executed debt commitment letter for the increased debt financing.\n74\nTable of Contents\nOn May 28, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also participated.\nMoelis led a discussion comparing the financial aspects of Gray\u2019s May 25, 2021 proposal and Party D\u2019s revised May 26, 2021 proposal. With respect to\nthe Gray proposal, our legal advisors provided their perspective that the \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision was problematic because it could unreasonably chill a\ncompetitive bidding process but that an increase in the break fee amount could be considered in the context of a price increase and did not consider $73\nmillion unreasonable as a percentage of overall transaction value.\nWith respect to Party D\u2019s revised proposal, representatives of Moelis provided its views on the proposed financing structure and terms and valuation\nconsiderations of the new combined company. The Moelis representatives discussed the impact of potential retransmission revenue synergies in\nconnection with the contribution of the Party B stations but noted that the Company would need to confirm the terms of the retransmission revenue\nagreements and the amount of synergies. The Moelis representatives noted that, giving full credit for the indicated retransmission revenue synergies, the\nnew combined company would be leveraged at 6.5x two-year average 2019/2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA under the revised proposal (as compared to\n7.3x under the previous proposal). Our senior management and advisors continued to be of the view that the additional complexity of the Party D\nproposal would require at least two weeks to fully negotiate and presented a materially higher risk of closing delay, which increased the risk of closing in\n2022.\nOur senior management and advisors discussed with our Board potential responses and next steps. After discussion, our Board authorized our senior\nmanagement and advisors to attempt to negotiate an acceptable amendment with Gray, which would need to include a cash price higher than Party D\u2019s\nrevised proposal and could include a break fee in the 2.5-3.0% of transaction value range but no \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision. Our Board was of the view\nthat the Company could also seek a waiver from Gray under the Merger Agreement to permit the Company to negotiate with Party D prior to making a\nfinding that Party D\u2019s revised proposal \u201cis or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal\u201d.\nLater that day, May 28, a Moelis representative spoke with Mr. Howell and discussed the terms of a potential amendment. At the direction of the\nCompany, the Moelis representative communicated that the Company would accept the $73 million break fee if Gray increased enterprise value to $2.825\nbillion (or $16.99 per share) and would accept the 5 business day \u201cmatch right\u201d period, but that the Company would not accept the \u201cforce the vote\u201d\nprovision. The Moelis representatives provided a written summary of the Company\u2019s proposal to Gray after the call.\nLater that day, Gray provided a written response. Gray offered to increase the enterprise value to $2.825 billion ($16.99 per share) but continued to insist\non the \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision and added two new provisions: an option to purchase three stations at an economic discount that would be exercisable\nby Gray if our Board changed its recommendation or terminated the transaction to accept a superior proposal, and a termination fee of $73 million payable\nby the Company in the event the closing did not occur due to a failure to consummate the NMG SpinCo financing.\nOn the morning of May 29, 2021, our senior management reviewed Gray\u2019s response with representatives of Moelis and Cooley. After discussion, our\nsenior management was prepared to recommend to our Board that it accept the $73 million termination fee and offer to increase the break fee to $85 million\nif Gray would agree to $2.825 billion enterprise value without the \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision and without the station purchase option. Our senior\nmanagement and advisors continued to be of the view that the \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision was problematic and believed that the station option would\nchill a competitive bidding process, was too dilutive of value, created tax leakage and operated as an additional termination fee. Our senior management\ninstructed representatives of Cooley to communicate this to Gray\u2019s legal advisors.\nLater that morning, representatives of Cooley spoke with representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day and communicated the current views of our senior\nmanagement. Representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day\n75\nTable of Contents\nexplained that the termination fee was intended to further align the parties\u2019 incentives to consummate their respective financings and provide greater\ncertainty of closing for both parties.\nOn May 29, 2021, representatives from Moelis and Cooley drafted a new list of clarifying questions with respect to Party D\u2019s proposal.\nOn May 31, 2021, Gray provided its response in writing. In its response, Gray accepted the $85 million break fee and $73 million termination fee and\nwithdrew the \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision. However, Gray retained the station purchase option and reduced its offer to $2.803 enterprise value ($16.55 per\nshare in cash). Members of our senior management subsequently reviewed the response with representatives of Moelis and Cooley. After discussion,\nour senior management determined that Gray would either need to accept the Company\u2019s last offer or senior management would recommend to our Board\nthat it consider how to move forward with Party D. Our senior management instructed representatives of Moelis to speak with Mr. Howell.\nA Moelis representative reached out to Mr. Howell. A representative of Wells Fargo returned the call and communicated that Gray would only move\nforward at a $2.825 billion enterprise value ($16.99 per share in cash) if the Company agreed to either the \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision or the station\npurchase option. Subsequently, a Moelis representative spoke with Mr. Howell regarding the parties\u2019 respective positions and the implications of not\nreaching agreement. Mr. Howell asked if the Company would have flexibility to consider increasing the break fee to $125 million if Gray agreed to a $2.825\nbillion enterprise value ($16.99 per share in cash) without the \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision or station purchase option. The Moelis representative agreed to\ndiscuss Mr. Howell\u2019s proposal with the Company.\nLater that day, May 31, our senior management spoke to representatives of Moelis and Cooley regarding Mr. Howell\u2019s proposal. They discussed the legal\nconsiderations applicable to break fees and discussed the benefits and risks of obtaining a higher price in exchange for a higher break fee and of not\nreaching agreement with Gray. After discussion, our senior management determined that it was prepared to recommend to our Board that it accept a $113\nmillion break fee (or 4% of transaction value) in exchange for a $2.825 billion enterprise value ($16.99 per share in cash).\nLater that evening, a Moelis representative and Mr. Harty, our Chief Executive Officer, separately spoke with Mr. Howell. Messrs. Harty and Howell\nagreed that they were both prepared to recommend to their respective Boards an amendment that provided for a $2.825 billion enterprise value ($16.99 per\nshare) in exchange for a $113 million break fee payable by the Company and a $73 million termination payable by the Company in the event that the\nClosing did not occur due to a failure to consummate the NMG SpinCo financing.\nOn June 1, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also participated.\nRepresentatives of Moelis updated our Board on the discussions between the Company and Gray since the previous Board meeting and described the\nterms of the proposed amendment with Gray. Representatives of Moelis and Cooley discussed the considerations and rationales for the increased break\nfee and the termination fee and why, in their view, it was preferable to agree to an increased break fee rather than a \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision or station\npurchase option. Representatives of Moelis also led a discussion to compare the terms of the proposed amendment with Gray to the terms of Party D\u2019s\nlatest revised proposal of May 26, 2021. After considering both proposals and fully assessing the benefits and risks of each, including certainty of value,\nregulatory considerations, path to closing and expected timing, our Board communicated its support for the proposed amendment to the Merger\nAgreement. Based on our Board\u2019s consideration of the factors in favor of and against the proposed amendment with Gray, including various factors that\nour Board had considered and weighed throughout the process, including the factors described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Reasons for the Merger,\u201d our Board\nunanimously (a) determined that the amended Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, (b)\ndetermined that the amended Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, taken together, are at a price and on\nterms that are fair to, and in the best interest of the Company, taking into consideration the effect on the\n76\nTable of Contents\nCompany\u2019s shareholders as well as the effect on certain of the other community interests set forth in Section 490.1108A of the IBCA, (c) approved the\nexecution, delivery and performance by the Company of the amended Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger, and (d) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company approve the adoption of the amended Merger\nAgreement and thereby the Merger.\nAfter our Board meeting, Mr. Harty spoke to Mr. Howell and informed him that our Board had unanimously approved the proposed amendment.\nSubsequently, over the course of the day, representatives of Cooley and representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day worked to finalize the formal\namendment to the Merger Agreement and a related amendment to the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nOn June 2, 2021, Gray\u2019s board of directors met and unanimously approved the proposed amendment to the Merger Agreement and authorized\nmanagement and the advisers to finalize the terms of the amendment and the related financing commitments. Later that day, after market close, the parties\nexecuted the amendment to the Merger Agreement and the amendment to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and Gray delivered updated\nexecuted financing commitments. Subsequently, a Moelis representative spoke with a principal of Party D to communicate that the Company would be\nannouncing the execution of the amendment with Gray.\nThe Company and Gray publicly announced their agreement on the Merger Agreement amendment early in the morning of June 3, 2021 before market\nopen.\nAs described elsewhere in this proxy statement, on October 6, 2021, the Company and NMG SpinCo entered into the Dotdash Merger Agreement. Gray\u2019s\nconsent was required for the Company to enter into the Dotdash Merger Agreement. Accordingly, on October 6, 2021, concurrently with entering into the\nDotdash Merger Agreement, the Company and Dotdash entered into the Consent Agreement with Gray. The Dotdash Merger and Consent Agreement\ndo not alter the recommendation of our Board that the shareholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement, as amended.\nOur Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.\nOpinion of Meredith\u2019s Financial Advisor",

Some of the summaries of financial analyses below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Moelis\u2019\nanalyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses.\nConsidering the data described below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and\nassumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Moelis\u2019 analyses.\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, stock prices are based on closing stock prices on April 30, 2021. For purposes of, among other things, deriving\nper share implied equity values for the Company, Moelis calculated certain per share amounts for the Company based on estimated diluted shares\noutstanding on the estimated closing date as of April 30, 2021 pursuant to the Original Agreement.\nFor purposes of its analyses, Moelis reviewed a number of financial metrics, including the following:\nAdjusted LMG EBITDA: generally calculated as the relevant company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to\ninclude the impact of stock-based compensation expense and to exclude one-time charges and benefits and to reflect the full-year impact of material\ncorporate transactions. Adjusted LMG EBITDA estimates for the Company assumed the spinoff of the Company\u2019s NMG business segment had already\noccurred.\n79\nTable of Contents\nBroadcast Cash Flow (\u201cBCF\u201d): Calculated as the relevant company\u2019s Adjusted LMG EBITDA plus corporate expense.\nEnterprise Value (or \u201cEV\u201d): which was calculated as the market value of the relevant company\u2019s fully diluted common equity based on its closing stock\nprice as of April 30, 2021 (i) plus preferred stock, (ii) plus debt, (iii) less cash and cash equivalents, (iv) less unconsolidated assets (v) plus book value of\nnon-controlling interests and (vi) plus after-tax underfunded pension obligation (in each of the foregoing clauses (i) through (v), as of the relevant\ncompany\u2019s most recently reported quarter end). The Company\u2019s EV was calculated assuming the spinoff of NMG was completed and that the Company\nhas net debt equal to the Target Net Debt Amount as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement of $1,975,000,000.\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, (i) the estimates of the future financial performance for the selected companies listed below were based on certain\npublicly available research analyst estimates for those companies, and (ii) the estimates of the future financial performance of the Company relied upon\nfor the financial analyses described below were based on the Financial Forecasts.\nMoelis\u2019 analyses were pro forma for the spinoff of NMG and reflected valuation for the Company\u2019s remaining broadcast television station business\nfollowing completion of the spinoff.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMoelis performed a discounted cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d) analysis of the Company (pro forma for the NMG spinoff) using the Financial Forecasts and other\ninformation and data provided by the Company\u2019s management to calculate an estimate of the present value of the estimated future unlevered after-tax free\ncash flows projected to be generated by the Company and an estimate of the present value of the Company\u2019s estimated terminal value, taking into\naccount the present value of the Company\u2019s cash tax rate of 30% during the projection period, as instructed by the Company\u2019s management. For\npurposes of the DCF analysis, Moelis calculated unlevered free cash flow as Adjusted LMG EBITDA, then less (i) taxes, (ii) cash payments for Broadcast\nRights, (iii) capital expenditures and (iv) changes in net working capital.\nIn performing the DCF analysis, Moelis utilized a range of discount rates of 6.00% to 8.00% based on an estimated range of the Company\u2019s weighted\naverage cost of capital (the \u201cWACC\u201d). The estimated WACC range reflected a cost of equity derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model using (i) a\nrisk-free rate based on 20-year U.S. government bonds, (ii) a selected range of unlevered betas and debt to total capitalization ratios informed by the\nselected publicly traded companies described below, (iii) an equity risk premium and (iv) a size premium. Moelis applied this range to the Company\u2019s\nestimated two-year average of the CY2024 and CY2025 Adjusted LMG EBITDA, as further adjusted to set depreciation and amortization equal to capital\nexpenditures. The foregoing range of discount rates was used to calculate (i) the estimated present values as of December 31, 2021 of the Company\u2019s\nestimated after-tax unlevered free cash flows for calendar years 2021 through 2025 using the mid-year convention and (ii) a range of estimated terminal\nvalues (based on the current and historical trading multiples for the publicly traded Pure-Play TV broadcasting companies described below) of 7.75x to\n9.25x.\nBased on the foregoing, Moelis derived implied per share reference ranges for the Company of $8.76 to $19.34. Moelis compared the implied per share\nreference ranges to the Merger consideration of $14.51 per share.\n80\nTable of Contents\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis\nMoelis reviewed financial information for nine transactions announced since 2017 involving companies in the television broadcasting industry with an\nEnterprise Value of at least approximately $500 million because those transactions primarily consisted of whole company transactions or station portfolio\ntransactions of comparable size. Moelis reviewed, among other things, transaction values of the selected precedent transactions as a multiple, to the\nextent information was publicly available, of two-year average Adjusted LMG EBITDA of the target company. Of the nine transactions evaluated, seven\nof the transactions had estimates of two-year average Adjusted LMG EBITDA of the target company available. Financial data for the relevant\ntransactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction. The selected precedent transactions\nused in this analysis and their implied transaction value to two-year average Adjusted LMG EBITDA multiples are summarized below:\nDate Announced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nEnterprise\nValue\n(in\nmillions)\nEV / 2-\nYear\nAvg.\nAdj.\nEBITDA\nFebruary 2021\nGray Television, Inc.\nQuincy Media, Inc.\n$\n925\n8.3x\nFebruary 2021\nGray Television, Inc.\nQuincy Media, Inc.\n$\n925\n8.3x\nMarch 2019\nE.W.

Moelis then applied such multiple range to the average of the Company\u2019s actual Adjusted LMG EBITDA for calendar year 2020 and estimated\nAdjusted LMG EBITDA for calendar year 2021 provided by the Company\u2019s management. This analysis indicated an implied per share reference range for\nthe Company of $5.95 to $16.66 per share. Moelis compared the implied per share reference range to the Merger consideration of $14.51 per share. In\nselecting its range, Moelis referenced the median of the data set (9.5x two-year average Adjusted LMG EBITDA).\n81\nTable of Contents\nThe other two transactions Moelis reviewed only had estimates for Broadcast Cash Flow of the target, for which Moelis reviewed, among other things,\ntransaction values of the selected precedent transactions as a multiple, to the extent information was publicly available, of two-year average BCF of the\ntarget company. Financial data for the relevant transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant\ntransaction. The selected precedent transactions used in this analysis and their implied transaction value to two-year average BCF multiples are\nsummarized below:\nDate Announced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nEnterprise\nValue\n(in\nmillions)\nEV /\n2-\nYear\nAvg.\nBCF\nFebruary 2019\nApollo Management, Inc.\nCox Television\n$\n3,100\n9.8x\nJune 2018\nGray Television, Inc.\nRaycom Media, Inc.\n$\n3,660\n9.3x\nMean\n9.5x\nBased on the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment, Moelis selected a multiple range of 9.0x to 10.0x two-year average BCF. Moelis then\napplied such multiple range to the average of the Company\u2019s actual BCF for calendar year 2020 and estimated BCF for calendar year 2021 provided by the\nCompany\u2019s management. This analysis indicated an implied per share reference range for the Company of $14.22 to $20.19 per share. Moelis compared the\nimplied per share reference range to the Merger consideration of $14.51 per share.\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis\nMoelis reviewed financial and stock market information of the selected publicly traded companies noted below that are in the television broadcasting\nbusiness, listed on a major U.S. exchange and deemed relevant by Moelis in certain respects to the Company.\nFinancial data for the selected companies were based on publicly available median consensus research analysts\u2019 estimates and public filings. In the case\nof projected Adjusted LMG EBITDA for the Company, Moelis reviewed the Financial Forecasts.\nThe results of this analysis are summarized in the following table:\nMarket\nCap\n($ in\nmillions)\nEnterprise\nValue\n($ in\nmillions)\nEV / 2-\nYear\nAvg.\nEBITDA\nPure-Play Broadcasters\nNexstar Media Group, Inc.\n$ 6,807\n$ 13,342\n8.0x\nTEGNA Inc.\n$ 4,482\n$\n8,001\n9.0x\nGray Television, Inc.\n$ 1,970\n$\n6,496\n8.2x\nDiversified Broadcasters\nSinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.\n$ 2,420\n$ 12,938\n6.6x\nE.W.

Moelis\u2019 range was informed by the Pure-Play Broadcasters given comparable\noperating and growth profiles to the Company. Moelis excluded TEGNA, Inc. from its multiple range because of the impact to TEGNA, Inc\u2019s trading levels\nfrom ongoing merger speculation. Moelis then applied its multiple range to the Company\u2019s average Adjusted LMG EBITDA for calendar year 2020 to\ncalendar year 2021, provided by the Company\u2019s management. This analysis indicated an implied per share reference range for the Company of $0.00 to\n$5.95 per share. Moelis compared the implied per share reference range to the Merger consideration of $14.51 per share.\n82\nTable of Contents\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing is a summary of the analyses undertaken by Moelis in connection with Moelis\u2019 opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nanalytical process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or summary set forth\nabove, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Moelis\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its\nfairness determination, Moelis considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis. Rather,\nMoelis made its fairness determination on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No\ncompany or transaction used in the analyses described above is identical to the Company or the Merger. In addition, such analyses do not purport to be\nappraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future\nresults are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses.\nBecause the analyses described above are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the\nparties or their respective advisors, neither the Company nor Moelis or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different\nfrom those forecast.\nThe Merger consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and the Acquiror and was approved by the Board.\nMoelis did not recommend any specific consideration to the Company or the Board, or that any specific amount or type of consideration constituted the\nonly appropriate consideration for the transaction. Moelis acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee\nfor its services, currently estimated to be approximately $33.6 million in the aggregate, $2.5 of which was earned in connection with the delivery of Moelis\u2019\nopinion dated May 3, 2021, in connection with the Board\u2019s consideration of the proposed Merger, regardless of the conclusion reached therein, and the\nremainder of which is contingent upon completion of the Merger. Furthermore, the Company has agreed to indemnify Moelis for certain liabilities,\nincluding liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.\nThe Board retained Moelis based upon Moelis\u2019s qualifications, experience, and expertise. Moelis\u2019 affiliates, employees, officers and partners may at any\ntime own securities (long or short) of the Company and Gray. Moelis may, in the future, provide investment banking or other services to the Company,\nGray, or other parties involved in the Merger and may receive compensation for such services. In the two years prior to the date hereof, Moelis acted as\nfinancial advisor to the Company in connection with a divestiture and earned fees of approximately $2.5 million in connection with such assignment.\nCertain Financial Forecasts Utilized by Meredith in Connection with the Merger",

            "text": "Certain Financial Forecasts Utilized by Meredith in Connection with the Merger\nOther than quarterly and annual financial guidance provided to investors, which the Company may update from time to time, the Company does not, as a\nmatter of course, publicly disclose forecasts as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other financial results due to, among other reasons, the\nunpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the Board\u2019s review of strategic and financial alternatives and\nevaluation of the Merger and the Spin-Off, the Company\u2019s management prepared certain forward-looking financial information with respect to LMG (after\ngiving effect to the Spin-Off) for calendar years 2021 through 2025 (the \u201cFinancial Forecasts\u201d) that were made available to the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisors. The Company has included below a summary of these forecasts for the purpose of providing shareholders and investors access to certain non-\npublic information that was furnished to third parties, and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. The inclusion of this information\nshould not be regarded as an indication that any of the Company, Moelis, their respective representatives or any other recipient of this information\nconsidered, or now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future results, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and it should\nnot be relied on as such.\nThe Financial Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance with published\nguidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American\n83Table of Contents\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts, or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(\u201cGAAP\u201d). In addition, the Financial Forecasts were not prepared with the assistance of or audited, reviewed, compiled or examined by independent\naccountants. The summary of the Financial Forecasts is not being included in this proxy statement to influence any shareholder\u2019s decision whether to\nsupport the Merger, but rather because the Financial Forecasts were made available by the Company to the Board and were used by Moelis in connection\nwith the rendering of its fairness opinion to the Board and performing its related financial analyses, as described under \u201cOpinion of Meredith\u2019s Financial\nAdvisor\u201d in this proxy statement. The Financial Forecasts may differ from publicly available analyst estimates and forecasts and does not take into\naccount any events or circumstances after the date they were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger and the Spin-Off.\nThe Financial Forecasts are subjective in many respects and were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may\nbe beyond the control of the Company\u2019s management. Because the Financial Forecasts cover multiple years, they become subject to greater uncertainty\nwith each successive year. Important factors that may affect actual results and result in such forecasts not being achieved include, but are not limited to:\nsignificant competition across the media landscape, including from other broadcasters, cable and satellite companies and digital content providers, social\nmedia platforms, search platforms, portals and marketing services, among others\u037e exposure to risks associated with the current challenging conditions in\nthe broadcast industry\u037e the risk of failure to develop or acquire technologies that adequately serve changing consumer behaviors and support the\nCompany\u2019s evolving business needs\u037e and other risk factors described in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2021, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8- K. In addition, the Financial Forecasts do not reflect any events that\ncould affect the Company\u2019s prospects, changes in general business or economic conditions or any other transaction or event that has occurred since, or\nthat may occur and that was not anticipated at the time the Financial Forecasts were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger and the Spin-\nOff. The assumptions upon which the Financial Forecasts were based necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future\neconomic, competitive and regulatory conditions and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of\nwhich are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Financial Forecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the forecasts contained in the Financial Forecasts will be realized, and actual results may vary materially from\nthose shown. The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Company or its affiliates,\nofficers, directors, advisors or other representatives considered or consider the Financial Forecasts necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the\nFinancial Forecasts should not be relied upon as such. None of the Company or its respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other\nrepresentatives can give any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Financial Forecasts, and the Company undertakes no obligation to\nupdate or otherwise revise or reconcile the Financial Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing or arising after the date such Financial Forecasts were\ngenerated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Financial Forecasts are shown\nto be in error. None of the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives intend to make publicly available any update or\nother revisions to the Financial Forecasts. None of the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives have made or make\nany representation to any shareholder or other person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the\nFinancial Forecasts or that forecasted results will be achieved. The Company has made no representation to Gray or Merger Sub, in the Merger\nAgreement or otherwise, concerning the Financial Forecasts.\nIn light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in these forecasts, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any,\nreliance on these forecasts.\n84\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a summary of the Financial Forecasts(1):\n($ in millions)\nCY2021E\nCY2022E\nCY2023E\nCY2024E\nCY2025E\nTotal Revenue\n$\n728\n$\n899\n$\n788\n$\n978\n$\n858\nTwo Year Average Revenue\n$\n783\n$\n813\n$\n843\n$\n883\n$\n918\nAdjusted LMG EBITDA(2)\n$\n207\n$\n338\n$\n219\n$\n374\n$\n246\nTwo Year Average EBITDA\n$\n267\n$\n272\n$\n278\n$\n297\n$\n310\n(1)\nExcludes Company\u2019s MNI business and People TV.\n(2)\nAdjusted LMG EBITDA is defined as Company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to include the impact of\nstock-based compensation expense and to exclude one-time charges and benefits and to reflect the full-year impact of material corporate\ntransactions.

Our Board was aware of these interests and\nconsidered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger. Shareholders should take these benefits into account in\ndeciding whether to vote for adoption of the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger.

Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Employee Matters Agreement,\nall payment obligations of Meredith to Mr. McCreery are retained by LMG RemainCo and not assumed by NMG SpinCo.\nTreatment of Equity Awards\nThe equity holdings of Meredith\u2019s directors and executive officers will generally be treated in the same manner as the equity holdings of all other equity\nholders.\nUpon the completion of the Merger, each outstanding stock option (whether or not then vested or exercisable), restricted stock award, restricted stock\nunit (\u201cRSU\u201d) and other Share-Based Award granted under Meredith\u2019s equity plans will be canceled and converted into the right to receive from Gray an\namount of cash equal to $16.99 per share (or in the case of stock options, the excess, if any, of $16.99 over the exercise price of such option, as adjusted in\nconnection with the Spin-Off as described below), without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding.\nPrior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, each outstanding stock option granted under Meredith\u2019s equity plans will be\nconverted into two options: (1) an adjusted Company stock option that will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in the\nMerger as described above, and (2) a stock option for NMG SpinCo shares. The number of shares subject to the adjusted Company stock option and the\nNMG SpinCo stock option will be equal to the number of shares subject to the related Company stock option prior to the Spin-Off, but the exercise prices\nwill be adjusted to reflect the relative values of LMG RemainCo and NMG SpinCo. The NMG SpinCo stock options will generally be subject to the same\nterms and conditions as set forth in the related Company stock option award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo stock options\nheld by employees of LMG RemainCo (including Mr. McCreery) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from NMG\nSpinCo as described below.\nPrior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, holders of restricted stock awards, RSUs and Share-Based Awards granted under\nMeredith\u2019s equity plans will receive restricted stock awards, RSUs and\n86\nTable of Contents\nShare-Based Awards in NMG SpinCo with respect to an equal number of shares subject to the related Company award prior to the Spin-Off. The NMG\nSpinCo restricted stock awards, RSUs and Share-Based Awards will generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the related\nCompany award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo RSUs held by employees of LMG RemainCo (including Mr. McCreery) will be\ncanceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from NMG SpinCo as described below.\nTo the extent that Meredith issues additional equity awards to its directors and executive officers after the date of this proxy statement but prior to the\ncompletion of the Spin-Off (or, in the case of Mr. McCreery, prior to the completion of the Merger), we anticipate that any such additional equity awards\nwill be treated in the Spin-Off and the Merger in a manner consistent with the existing equity awards held by Meredith\u2019s directors and executive officers,\nas described above.\nSee \u201cInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Cash-Out of Certain Meredith Equity Awards\u201d below for further detail.\nOutstanding Shares Held by Executive Officers and Directors\nAs of September 30, 2021, the executive officers and directors of Meredith owned, in the aggregate, 245,023 shares of Meredith Common Stock (which, for\nclarity, excludes shares of Meredith Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Meredith stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards,\nRSUs and other Share-Based Awards) and 2,157,657 shares of Meredith Class B Stock.\nThe following table sets forth (a) the number of shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock owned as of September 30, 2021 by each\nof our executive officers and directors and (b) the aggregate Merger consideration that would be payable for such shares.\nName\nNumber of\nShares of\nMeredith\nCommon\nStock Owned\n(#)\nNumber of\nShares of\nMeredith Class\nB Stock\nOwned (#)\nMerger\nConsideration\nfor Shares\nOwned ($)\nExecutive Officers\nThomas H.

The special incentive awards will be granted to Messrs. Harty, Frierott and Zieser following the Spin-Off\nand will have an aggregate approximate grant date value equal to $1,500,000, $1,000,000, and $1,000,000, respectively. Fifty percent of the special incentive\nawards in NMG SpinCo will be in the form of stock options and the remaining fifty percent will be in the form of restricted stock units and each award will\ncliff\n88\nTable of Contents\nvest after three years, subject to each executive\u2019s continued employment with NMG SpinCo. However, if the Dotdash Merger is consummated, the special\nincentive awards will be paid in cash in lieu of stock options and restricted stock units at the time of such consummation.\nChange in Control Severance Agreement\nThe Company previously entered into a change in control severance agreement (\u201cCIC Agreement\u201d) with each of Thomas Harty, Jason Frierott, John\nZieser, Patrick McCreery and Catherine Levene. The CIC Agreement provides for payments and other benefits if (i) the applicable executive is terminated\nin advance of or within two years of a change in control of the Company for any reason other than death, disability, mandatory retirement, \u201cCause\u201d or\ntermination by the executive other than for \u201cGood Reason\u201d, each as defined in the CIC Agreement, or (ii) the executive provides a notice of termination\nfor any reason during the 30 day period immediately following the first anniversary of the change in control.\nWith respect to Mr. McCreery, whose CIC Agreement will be retained by LMG RemainCo, the Merger will qualify as a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of\nhis CIC Agreement. With respect to the other executives, their respective existing CIC Agreements will be assigned to, and assumed by, NMG SpinCo\nprior to the Merger in connection with the Separation, and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and Spin-Off Agreements will not\nqualify as a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of their respective CIC Agreements. See \u201cRetention Agreements\u201d below. In light of the foregoing, the\nfollowing description of terms of the CIC Agreement, and the amounts set forth in the \u201cGolden Parachute\u201d Compensation table below, assume that the\nMerger constitutes a \u201cchange in control\u201d solely for purposes of Mr. McCreery\u2019s CIC Agreement.\nBase Salary. The CIC Agreement provide for the lump sum payment of three times Mr. McCreery\u2019s current annual base salary.\nAnnual Incentive. The CIC Agreement provides for the lump sum payment of three times the higher of Mr. McCreery\u2019s target Annual Incentive or the\nhighest Annual Incentive paid in respect of the three fiscal years immediately prior to the year in which the change in control occurred. Mr. McCreery is\nalso entitled to any earned but unpaid Annual Incentive in the year of termination.\nDeferred Compensation. The CIC Agreement provides for the lump sum payment of any compensation previously deferred including any accrued\ninterest or earnings as defined in the deferral agreements.\nPension Benefits. The CIC Agreement provides for an additional three years of age and service to be added (without affecting the life expectancy) in\ncalculating Mr. McCreery\u2019s pension benefit in the event of a change in control.\nContinuation of Benefits and Perquisites. The CIC Agreement provides that Mr. McCreery and his eligible dependents shall continue, to the extent\npermitted by law, to be covered by all services, programs, perquisites, defined contribution plans and insurance plans in which Mr. McCreery participated\nimmediately prior to the time of the change in control, for a period of three years after Mr. McCreery\u2019s date of termination, and, in the case of qualified\nplan matching contributions, any amounts forfeited as of the date of termination.\nPost-Retirement Welfare Benefits. The CIC Agreement provides for an additional three years of age and service to be added for purposes of determining\nMr. McCreery\u2019s post-retirement welfare benefits (including medical, dental and life). However, even with these additional years of service, Mr. McCreery\nwould not meet the eligibility requirements in order to participate in the post-retirement welfare plan.\nRetention Agreements\nThe Company entered into a Retention, Assignment and Acknowledgement Agreement (\u201cRetention Agreement\u201d) on August 10, 2021 with each of\nThomas Harty, Jason Frierott, John Zieser and Catherine Levene.\n89\nTable of Contents\nPursuant to the Retention Agreement and in connection with the Spin-Off, each applicable executive has agreed, among other things, to have his or her\nexisting employment agreement and CIC Agreement assumed by, and assigned to, NMG SpinCo, and acknowledged that the Separation, the Spin-Off and\nthe Merger do not constitute a change in control for purposes of his or her employment agreement and CIC Agreement. In addition, under the Retention\nAgreement, as an incentive for each executive to remain employed with the Company through the consummation of the Spin-Off, and with NMG SpinCo\nfollowing the Spin-Off and through August 10, 2024, each executive will be eligible to earn a cash retention bonus in an amount equal to the value of a\nnotional number of shares of common stock of NMG SpinCo, subject to the executive\u2019s continued employment with NMG SpinCo through August 10,\n2024 (or, if the executive\u2019s employment is terminated after the consummation of the Spin-Off and prior to August 10, 2024 by the Company without cause,\nby the executive for good reason (other than due to a change in duties and responsibilities as a result of the Spin-Off), or due to the executive\u2019s death or\ndisability, each as defined in the executive\u2019s applicable agreements). The notional number of shares are as follows: Harty (265,550), Frierott (132,775),\nZieser (151,750) and Levene (113,800). Based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock as of August 10, 2021 (less the $16.99 per share to be\nreceived in the Merger), the indicative values of the notional shares as of August 10, 2021, are approximately: Harty ($7,000,000), Frierott ($3,500,000),\nZieser ($4,000,000) and Levene ($3,000,000). The retention bonuses will not be paid if the Spin-Off and Merger are not consummated. The CIC Agreement\nfor each executive will remain in effect at least through August 10, 2024, and the retention bonuses will not be paid if the executive becomes entitled to\npayments under his or her CIC Agreement upon a qualifying termination following a change in control of NMG SpinCo, as defined in the executive\u2019s CIC\nAgreement, prior to August 10, 2024. Each Retention Agreement will also be assumed by, and assigned to, NMG SpinCo in connection with the\nSeparation and Spin-Off.\nImpact of Dotdash Merger\nAs described above under \u201cThe Separation, Distribution, Spin-Off and Merger,\u201d the Dotdash Merger will occur, if at all, after the consummation of the\nSpin-Off and the Merger (unless the Merger Agreement is terminated, in which case Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments\nto the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement). In addition to the payments\nand benefits described above that may be triggered as a result of the Spin-Off and the Merger, all NMG SpinCo stock options, restricted stock awards,\nRSUs and Share-Based Awards will accelerate, be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from Dotdash equal to the $42.18 cash\nper share consideration in the Dotdash Merger (subject to downward adjustment pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement), or, in the case of NMG\nSpinCo stock options, the excess, if any, of $42.18 (as adjusted) less the exercise price for such stock option. The Dotdash Merger will also qualify as a\n\u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of the CIC Agreement that the Company has entered into with each of Thomas Harty, Jason Frierott, John Zieser, and\nCatherine Levene, and in connection with the Dotdash Merger, each of Messrs. Harty, Frierott and Zieser and Ms. Levene may become entitled to the\npayments and benefits described above under \u201cInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Change in Control Severance\nAgreement\u201d. To the extent Mr. Harty, Frierott or Zieser or Ms. Levene becomes entitled to the payments and benefits under his or her CIC Agreement\nupon a qualifying termination following the Dotdash Merger, the retention bonus described above under \u201cInterests of Our Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger\u2014Retention Agreements\u201d will not be paid to the applicable executive.\n\u201cGolden Parachute\u201d Compensation\nThe following table sets forth the estimated amounts of \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation (for purposes of Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K) that each\nnamed executive officer of Meredith could receive in connection with the Spin-Off and the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts set forth in\nthe table do not reflect the impact of the Dotdash Merger, which will occur, if at all, after the consummation of the Spin-Off and the Merger (unless the\nMerger Agreement is terminated, in which case Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement\nand the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement). Unless otherwise specified in the accompanying footnotes, the\namounts set forth in\n90\nTable of Contents\nthe table assume that the Merger was completed, and the applicable named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination without cause or for\ngood reason, as of December 1, 2021. Certain of the amounts payable may vary depending on the actual dates on which the Merger is completed and\nwhether the named executive officer terminates employment. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may differ\nin material respects from the amounts set forth below. As noted above, except with regard to certain equity awards that will be cashed out in connection\nwith the Merger (as described above under \u201cInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Cash-Out of Certain Meredith Equity\nAwards\u201d), NMG SpinCo is obligated to assume responsibility for, pay and be liable for, all wages, salaries, welfare, incentive compensation and\nemployment-related liabilities, and all compensation and employment-related plans and agreements, with respect to each named executive officer (other\nthan Patrick McCreery).\nName\nCash\n($)(1)\nEquity\n($)(2)\nPension/\nNQDC\n($)(3)\nPerquisites/\nBenefits\n($)(4)\nOther\n($)(5)\nTotal\n($)\nThomas H.

Meredith, IV (the \u201cSupporting Shareholders\u201d), Company shareholders who collectively control 1.7% of\nthe issued and outstanding Meredith Common Stock and approximately 89.3% of the issued and outstanding Meredith Class B Stock (representing\napproximately 50.3% of the voting power when voting together as a single class) as of the Record Date. Pursuant to the Support Agreement, such\nshareholders agreed to vote their Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock in favor of the Merger Proposal and to take certain other actions\nin furtherance of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the Support Agreement, the Supporting Shareholders agreed to vote or execute consents in favor of the approval and adoption\nof the Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby and against (i) any acquisition proposal with respect to Meredith or any other\nmerger, consolidation, sale\n91\nTable of Contents\nof substantial assets, reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, winding up or any other business combination other than the transaction\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) any action or proposal to amend the Meredith articles of incorporation or bylaws, and (iii) any action,\nproposal, transaction or agreement involving Meredith or its subsidiaries that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede,\nfrustrate, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the mergers or the transaction. In addition, the Supporting Shareholders agreed not to\ntransfer any Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock held by them prior to the earlier of the effective time or the termination of the Merger\nAgreement other than (i) pursuant to the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) with the prior written consent of Gray, (iii) a transfer of up to\n100,000 shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock in the aggregate and (iv) certain transfers to affiliates and permitted transferees so\nlong as (A) such a transferee executes a customary joinder to the Support Agreement agreeing to be bound by its terms. The Supporting Shareholder\nalso agreed not to, prior to the earlier of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement, convert any shares of Meredith Class B Stock into\nshares of Meredith Common Stock.\nExcept as permitted under the Merger Agreement, the Supporting Shareholders also agreed to (and to cause their respective representatives to) cease all\ndiscussions with any person relating to any acquisition proposal in respect of Meredith and agreed not to (and to cause their respective representatives\nnot to) prior to the earlier of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit any acquisition inquiries or\nacquisition proposals for Meredith, (ii) furnish any non-public information regarding Meredith or any of its subsidiaries to any person who has made an\nacquisition proposal for Meredith, (iii) knowingly engage in discussions or negotiations with any person who has made any acquisition proposal for\nMeredith (other than discussions in the ordinary course of business that are unrelated to an acquisition inquiry or acquisition proposal), (iv) approve,\nendorse or recommend any acquisition proposal for Meredith or withdraw or propose to withdraw its approval and recommendation in favor of the\nSupport Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby or (v) enter into any agreement with respect to any acquisition\nproposal for Meredith.

Appraisal rights are not available under Iowa law with respect to shares of Meredith Common Stock.\nUnder the IBCA, holders of Meredith Class B Stock who do not vote in favor of the Merger and who comply with the applicable provisions of Sections\n490.1301 through 490.1340 of the IBCA (the \u201cIowa Appraisal Provisions\u201d) will have the right, under certain circumstances, to seek appraisal of the fair\nvalue of their Meredith Class B Stock if the Merger is completed. All holders of Meredith Class B Stock who follow the procedures set forth in the Iowa\nAppraisal Provisions to perfect their appraisal rights, and who do not elect to accept payment for their shares based on Meredith\u2019s estimate of the fair\nvalue of the Meredith Class B Stock, will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Iowa district court of Polk County (the \u201cIowa District Court\u201d),\nand to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of those shares as determined by the Iowa District Court, together with interest, if any. It is possible\nthat any determination of fair value by the Iowa District Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the consideration received by the Meredith\nshareholders in the Merger. Shareholders considering appraisal should be aware that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial\npoint of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, fair value\nunder the Iowa Appraisal Provisions.\n92Table of Contents\nIN ADDITION TO SUBMITTING A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL, IN ORDER TO PRESERVE ANY APPRAISAL RIGHTS THAT A MEREDITH\nSHAREHOLDER MAY HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THEIR SHARES OF MEREDITH CLASS B STOCK, SUCH MEREDITH SHAREHOLDER MUST\nNOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL AND MUST OTHERWISE FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES PRESCRIBED BY THE IOWA\nAPPRAISAL PROVISIONS. A SHAREHOLDER WISHING TO EXERCISE ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS MUST NOT SURRENDER ITS MEREDITH\nCLASS B STOCK FOR PAYMENT IN THE MERGER.\nThe following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions required to be followed by dissenting Meredith\nshareholders wishing to demand and perfect their appraisal rights with respect to their holdings of Meredith Class B Stock. This summary, however, is not\na complete statement of all applicable requirements and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, the full\ntext of which appears in Annex C to this proxy statement. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in the Iowa Appraisal Provisions will\nresult in the loss of appraisal rights. All references in the Iowa Appraisal Provisions to a \u201cshareholder\u201d and all references in this summary to a\n\u201cshareholder\u201d are to the record holder of Meredith Class B Stock.\nUnder the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, Meredith is required to include in the notice of the Special Meeting a statement that the corporation has concluded\nthat the shareholders are, or may be, entitled to assert appraisal rights. A copy of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions must be included with that notice sent to\nthose record shareholders that are entitled to exercise appraisal rights.\nIf a shareholder wishes to consider exercising its appraisal rights, such shareholder should carefully review the text of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions set\nforth in Annex C to this proxy statement and consult its legal advisor. If such shareholder fails to timely and properly comply with the requirements of the\nIowa Appraisal Provisions, its appraisal rights may be lost.\nIf a shareholder elects to demand appraisal of its Meredith Class B Stock, it must satisfy each of the following conditions:\n\u2022\nIt must deliver to Meredith a written notice of its intent to demand payment of the fair value of its Meredith Class B Stock under the Iowa\nAppraisal Provisions if the proposed Merger is effectuated. It must deliver such notice to Meredith before the vote is taken on the Merger\nat the Special Meeting.\n\u2022\nIt must not vote in favor of the Merger.\nAll demands for appraisal should be made in writing and addressed to:\nMeredith Corporation\n1716 Locust Street\nDes Moines, Iowa 50309\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nand must be executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the Meredith Class B Stock. If a shareholder does not satisfy the above requirements, it will\nnot be entitled to payment pursuant to the appraisal rights.\nA record shareholder may assert appraisal rights as to fewer than all the shares of Meredith Class B Stock registered in its name, but owned by a\nbeneficial shareholder, only if the record shareholder objects with respect to all of the Meredith Class B Stock owned by the beneficial shareholder and\nnotifies Meredith in writing of the name and address of each beneficial shareholder on whose behalf the appraisal rights are being asserted. The rights of\na record shareholder who asserts appraisal rights for only part of the Meredith Class B Stock held of record in its name will be determined as if the shares\nas to which the record shareholder objects and the record shareholder\u2019s other Meredith Class B Stock were registered in the names of different record\nshareholders. A\n93\nTable of Contents\nbeneficial owner may assert appraisal rights as to Meredith Class B Stock held on behalf of such beneficial owner only if it submits to Meredith the\nrecord shareholder\u2019s written consent to the assertion of such rights no later than the date specified in the written appraisal notice (discussed below)\nand does so with respect to all shares of the class that are beneficially owned by such beneficial owner.\nIf the Merger is completed, Meredith must send a written appraisal notice and form to each holder of Meredith Class B Stock who previously notified\nMeredith of such holder\u2019s intent to demand payment and who did not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. The appraisal notice must include, among\nother information, Meredith\u2019s estimate of the fair value of the Meredith Class B Stock. A record shareholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must\nexecute and return the form and, in a case of certificated shares, deposit the shareholder\u2019s certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the\ndate referred to in the notice. If a shareholder does not execute and return the form prior to the stated deadline and, in the case of certificated shares,\ndeposit the shareholder\u2019s share certificates where required, the shareholder will not be entitled to payment under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions and, in\nlieu thereof, will be entitled only to receive the Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Meredith Merger. A record shareholder who receives\nnotice and wishes to exercise appraisal rights must certify on the form whether beneficial ownership of the Meredith Class B Stock was acquired before\nthe date the principal terms of the Merger Proposal were announced publicly. If a record shareholder fails to make this certification, Meredith may elect to\ntreat the shareholder\u2019s shares as \u201cafter-acquired shares\u201d under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions as discussed below. Once a shareholder deposits its\ncertificates and returns the appraisal form prior to the stated deadline, such shareholder will lose its rights as a Meredith shareholder to receive the\nMerger Consideration payable in connection with the Merger and, instead, will be entitled to receive the fair value of its shares of Meredith Class B Stock\nin accordance with the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, subject to certain rights of withdrawal required to be set forth in Meredith\u2019s written appraisal notice.\nMeredith will pay in cash the amount Meredith estimates to be fair value of the record shareholder\u2019s shares, plus interest, to any record shareholder who\nreturns the appraisal form and complies with all provisions of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, within thirty (30) days after the form is due (except, as noted\nbelow, with respect to shares treated as \u201cafter-acquired shares,\u201d in which case Meredith must only make an offer to purchase such shares at the fair value\nas estimated by Meredith). The payment will be accompanied by Meredith\u2019s financial statements, a statement of Meredith\u2019s estimate of the fair value of\nthe shares and a statement that shareholders entitled to payment have the right to demand further payment under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, if the\nshareholders are dissatisfied with the payment made by Meredith, under certain circumstances described in detail in the Iowa Appraisal Provisions.\nA shareholder dissatisfied with Meredith\u2019s payment (based on Meredith\u2019s estimate of the fair value of the shares) may demand further payment by\nnotifying Meredith in writing of the shareholder\u2019s estimate of fair value and demanding payment of such shareholder\u2019s estimate of fair value (less the\namount of the Meredith payment previously made), plus interest. A shareholder who fails to notify Meredith of such shareholder\u2019s demand for further\npayment within thirty (30) days after receiving Meredith\u2019s payment will waive the right to demand further payment and will be entitled only to the\npayment made by Meredith. If the shareholder makes a demand for further payment based on its estimate of fair value, and such demand remains\nunsettled for a period of sixty (60) days after Meredith receives such demand, Meredith will then be required to commence a proceeding in the Iowa\nDistrict Court to determine the fair value of the shares. Upon the commencement of such action, the court may appoint one or more persons to act as\nappraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value to the court. To the extent that the court determines that the fair\nvalue of the shares exceed the amount of the payment previously made by Meredith, the shareholder will be entitled to judgment for the amount by which\nthe court\u2019s determination of fair value exceeds the payment previously made by Meredith, plus interest.\nThe procedure described above is somewhat different for shares of Meredith Class B Stock that Meredith is entitled to treat as \u201cafter-acquired shares\u201d\nunder the Iowa Appraisal Provisions. \u201cAfter-acquired shares\u201d are shares of Meredith Class B Stock of which beneficial ownership was acquired after the\ndate the principal terms\n94\nTable of Contents\nof the Merger Proposal were publicly announced (which for these purposes includes shares of Meredith Class B Stock for which the holder failed to\ncertify on the appraisal form that beneficial ownership of such shares was acquired prior to the date of such public announcement). To the extent that\nMeredith is entitled to treat any shares of Meredith Class B Stock as \u201cafter-acquired shares\u201d, then Meredith must only make an offer to purchase such\nshares based on Meredith\u2019s estimate of fair value in lieu of making an actual cash payment to the shareholder upon return of the appraisal form and\ndeposit of certificates. If the shareholder holding shares treated as \u201cafter-acquired shares\u201d elects to accept Meredith\u2019s offer, then Meredith will make a\ncash payment in the amount of the offer, plus interest, to such shareholder in full satisfaction of its demand under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions.\nIf a shareholder desires to exercise its appraisal rights, it must not vote for the Merger Proposal and it must strictly comply with the procedures set\nforth in the Iowa Appraisal Provisions.\nThe process of demanding and exercising appraisal rights requires strict compliance with technical prerequisites under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions. In\nview of the complexity of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, Meredith shareholders who may wish to dissent from the Merger and pursue appraisal rights\nwith respect to their shares of Meredith Class B Stock should consult their legal advisors. Failure to take any required step in connection with\nexercising appraisal rights may result in the termination or waiver of such rights. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing\nsummary and the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, the Iowa Appraisal Provisions will govern. The text of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions is attached hereto as\nAnnex C.\nPursuant to the Support Agreement, the Meredith shareholders signatory thereto, who collectively control approximately 89.3% of the issued and\noutstanding Meredith Class B Stock as of the Record Date, have waived such appraisal rights in writing.\nDelisting and Deregistration of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock",

This summary is based on the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), applicable\nTreasury Regulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings, each as in effect as of the date hereof. These laws and authorities are subject to\ndiffering interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax consequences to our shareholders as\ndescribed herein. No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) has been or will be sought with respect to any aspect of the transactions described\nherein, and no opinion of counsel will be rendered in connection with the transactions described herein.

Accordingly, an amount equal\nto the fair market value of the NMG SpinCo Stock received by a shareholder on the Distribution Date will be treated as a taxable dividend to the extent of\nsuch shareholder\u2019s ratable share of any current or accumulated earnings and profits of Meredith, with the excess treated first as a non-taxable return of\ncapital to the extent of such shareholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable, and then as capital\ngain. For this purpose, Meredith shareholders who acquired different blocks of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock at different\ntimes for different prices must calculate gain or loss separately for each identifiable block of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B\nStock, as applicable, owned by such shareholder. Meredith\u2019s earnings and profits generally will be increased by any gain recognized by Meredith as a\nresult of the transfer of assets between Meredith and NMG SpinCo in connection with the Spin-Off.\nA shareholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock held on the Distribution Date will be reduced (but not\nbelow zero) to the extent the fair market value of NMG SpinCo\u2019s shares received by such shareholder from Meredith exceeds such shareholder\u2019s ratable\nshare of Meredith\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Meredith will not be able to advise the shareholders of the amount of its earnings and\nprofits until after the Distribution and Merger. A shareholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of NMG SpinCo Stock received in the Distribution will be equal to\ntheir fair market value as of the Distribution Date.\nIn addition, Meredith or other applicable withholding agents may be required to withhold at the applicable rate on all or a portion of the Distribution\npayable to non-U.S. shareholders, and any such withholding would be satisfied by Meredith or the other applicable withholding agent withholding and\nselling a portion of the shares of NMG SpinCo Stock otherwise distributable to non-U.S. shareholders.\nTax Consequences of the Merger\nThe conversion of the Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock into cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction. Generally, this means\nthat our shareholders will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (a) the amount of cash they receive in the Merger, and (b) their adjusted\ntax basis in their Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable. For this purpose, Meredith shareholders who acquired different\nblocks of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock at different times for different prices must calculate gain or loss separately for\neach identifiable block of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable, surrendered in the exchange. As discussed in the\nsection titled\n97\nTable of Contents\n\u201cTax Consequences of the Distribution\u201d above, the Distribution may reduce a shareholder\u2019s basis in their shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith\nClass B Stock, as applicable, which may cause such shareholder to recognize additional capital gains (or reduced capital loss) as a result of the Merger.\nSubject to various exceptions, a shareholder\u2019s gain or loss on the disposition of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock will be characterized\nas capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has held their Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock,\nas applicable, for more than one year as of the effective time of the Merger. If a shareholder\u2019s holding period for any Meredith Common Stock or Meredith\nClass B Stock is one year or less at the effective time of the Merger, any gain or loss with respect to such Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B\nStock will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate shareholders generally are currently\ntaxable at preferential rates relative to the rates applicable to other forms of income. Capital losses are subject to limitations on deductibility.\nAppraisal or Dissenter\u2019s Rights\nA Meredith shareholder who exercises appraisal or dissenters\u2019 rights for such shareholder\u2019s Meredith Class B Stock with respect to the Merger and\nreceives payment for such stock in cash will generally recognize capital gain or loss, measured by the difference between the cash received and such\nshareholder\u2019s tax basis in its Meredith Class B Stock. Shareholders who exercise appraisal or dissenters\u2019 rights are urged to consult their own tax\nadvisors. Interest, if any, awarded in an appraisal proceeding by a court would be included in such shareholder\u2019s income as ordinary income for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes.\nTax Consequences of the Dotdash Merger\nThe following description of the tax consequences of the Dotdash Merger assumes that the Dotdash Merger is completed in accordance with the terms\nof the Dotdash Merger Agreement as described herein. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Dotdash Merger will constitute a fully taxable\ntransaction for a holder of NMG SpinCo Stock and each such holder will therefore recognize gain or loss, if any, as a result of the disposition of NMG\nSpinCo Stock in the Dotdash Merger.\nIn the Dotdash Merger, holders of NMG SpinCo Stock will recognize gain or loss, if any, equal to the difference between the cash they receive in\nexchange for their shares of NMG SpinCo Stock and their adjusted tax basis in such shares of NMG SpinCo Stock surrendered in the Dotdash Merger. If\nthe Dotdash Merger is completed on the Distribution Date, we expect each holder of NMG SpinCo Stock to have a tax basis in their NMG SpinCo Stock\nreceived in the Distribution that is equal to the cash received by such holder in the Dotdash Merger, in which case such a holder will not recognize gain\nor loss in connection with the Dotdash Merger. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the Distribution Date, any capital gain or loss by a holder of\nNMG SpinCo Stock should be short-term capital gain or loss, unless the NMG SpinCo Stock being disposed of has been held by such holder for more\nthan one year at the time the Dotdash Merger is completed. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate holders, including individuals,\nare currently subject to taxation at preferential rates. Short-term capital gains are taxed at rates applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of capital\nlosses is subject to limitations.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nA Meredith shareholder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to certain reportable payments including taxable proceeds received in\nexchange for the shareholder\u2019s shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable, in the Merger, or the shareholder\u2019s shares of\nNMG SpinCo Stock in the DotDash Merger. Backup withholding will generally not apply, however, to a Meredith shareholder who furnishes the exchange\nagent with a correct taxpayer identification number on IRS Form W-9 (if such shareholder is a U.S. person as defined in the instructions thereto) or the\nappropriate IRS Form W-8 (if the shareholder is not such a U.S. person) or otherwise establishes a basis for exemption from backup withholding. Each\nMeredith shareholder and, if applicable, each other payee, should properly complete and sign the IRS\n98\nTable of Contents\nForm W-9 included with each applicable letter of transmittal (or the applicable IRS Form W-8) to provide the information and certification(s) necessary to\navoid the imposition of backup withholding, unless an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the exchange agent. Meredith\nshareholders who fail to provide their correct taxpayer identification numbers and the appropriate certifications, or to establish an exemption as described\nabove, will be subject to backup withholding on cash they receive in the Merger and/or DotDash Merger, as applicable, and may be subject to penalties\nimposed by the IRS. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be credited against the tax liability of persons subject to backup\nwithholding, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nMeredith shareholders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualifications for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining\nsuch an exemption. If the exchange agent withholds on a payment to a shareholder, the affected shareholder should contact its tax advisor regarding\nwhether and how any refund, credit or other tax benefit might be recognized with respect to any such withheld amounts.\nTHE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL\nINCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISTRIBUTION, THE MERGER OR THE DOTDASH MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE DISCUSSION DOES\nNOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, A SHAREHOLDER\u2019S INDIVIDUAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES OR TO CERTAIN TYPES OF SHAREHOLDERS MENTIONED ABOVE. MOREOVER, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS\nANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY NON-U.S., STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISTRIBUTION, THE MERGER OR THE\nDOTDASH MERGER.",

            "text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nFCC Matters\nUnder U.S. federal communications laws, Meredith and Gray may not complete the Merger unless they have first obtained the FCC\u2019s consent. FCC\nconsent is sought through the filing of transfer of control applications with the FCC, which are subject to public comment and objections from third\nparties. The applications for FCC consent to the transaction were filed by Meredith and Gray on May 14, 2021.\nThe applications for consent to transfer the Meredith broadcast licenses to Gray involve a change of more than 50% of the voting rights representing\nultimate control of Meredith and its broadcast subsidiaries and thus will constitute a \u201csubstantial\u201d change in ownership or control of the Meredith\nlicensees within the meaning of the FCC\u2019s rules. Accordingly, the FCC must provide public notice for a period of 30 days prior to acting on the\napplications. During that period, interested parties, including members of the public, may file informal objections to the applications or petitions to deny\nthe applications. The filing of a petition to deny a transfer application or an informal objection could delay FCC processing of the applications. The\ndeadline for filing petitions to deny applications was June 25, 2021. One viewer filed comments that are not specific to the proposed transaction and Gray\nand Meredith jointly filed a response to the comments. Also, a company that sells outdoor television antennas filed the Objection proposing that the FCC\nimpose a condition on its approval of the transaction requiring Gray to accept reasonable advertisement requests from vendors of over-the-air antennas.\nMeredith and Gray responded to the Objection and asked the FCC to process the transaction without delay. To facilitate regulatory approvals for the\nMerger, Gray agreed to divest WJRT-TV in the Flint-Saginaw DMA, the only market in which both Gray and Meredith operate stations. On July 14, 2021,\nGray announced an agreement to divest WJRT-TV pursuant to an agreement with Allen Media. On July 23, 2021, Gray filed an application seeking\nconsent to assign the license for WJRT-TV to Allen Media. On July 27, 2021, the FCC issued a public notice accepting the application and establishing\nAugust 26, 2021 as the deadline for filing petitions to deny. The FCC granted the WJRT-TV assignment application on September 10, 2021, and Gray and\nAllen Media consummated the WJRT-TV transaction on September 23, 2021.\nIn determining whether to approve the transfer of control of a television broadcast licensee or an assignment of license, the FCC considers a number of\nfactors pertaining to the proposed licensee, including compliance with\n99Table of Contents\nvarious rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the licensee and those persons holding significant voting or positional\ninterests in the licensee or in the entities controlling the licensee, the Communications Act of 1934 (the \u201cCommunications Act\u201d) limitations on foreign\nownership and control of broadcast licensees, and compliance with FCC rules and regulations. The timing or outcome of the FCC approval process\ncannot be predicted.\nMeredith and Gray have each agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable any necessary consent, approval, waiver and\nauthorization of any governmental entity in connection with the transaction. For a further description, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Efforts to Close the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 117.\nAntitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act, and the related rules and regulations that have been issued by the FTC, certain acquisitions may not be consummated, nor may the\nacquiring party direct the operations of the acquired company, until certain information and documentary material has been furnished for review by the\nFTC and the Antitrust Division and waiting period requirements have been observed. These requirements apply to the Merger.\nUnder the HSR Act, the Merger may not be completed until the expiration or earlier termination of a thirty-calendar day waiting period, which began when\nMeredith and Gray filed a Notification and Report Form, together with required documentary attachments, with the FTC and the Antitrust Division on\nMay 14, 2021. On June 14, 2021, the Antitrust Division issued a Second Request. The Second Request defines the \u201cRelevant Area\u201d as the Flint-Saginaw-\nBay City, Michigan DMA and the \u201cRelevant Product\u201d as \u201cthe sale of spot advertising time on broadcast television stations.\u201d The issuance of a Second\nRequest extends the waiting period until thirty calendar days after Meredith and Gray comply with the Second Request or until the Antitrust Division\nterminates the waiting period.\nAt any time before or after the completion of the transaction, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as either\ndeems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking to unwind the Merger or seeking\nthe divestiture of assets of Meredith or Gray (or their respective subsidiaries). To address potential antitrust concerns with the Merger and to comply\nwith FCC rules, on July 14, 2021, Gray announced an agreement to divest its WJRT-TV station in the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City, Michigan DMA to Allen\nMedia Broadcasting, LLC. On September 21, 2021, the Antitrust Division advised that it had no objections to Allen Media Group as the buyer of WJRT-\nTV. On September 23, 2021, Gray consummated the sale of WJRT-TV to Allen Media. As a result, Gray and Meredith no longer operate stations in the\nsame DMA. The Antitrust Division informed Meredith on September 28, 2021 that it has closed its investigation of the Merger, and on October 8, 2021,\nthe waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated.\nState attorneys general may also bring legal action under both state and federal antitrust laws, as applicable. Private parties may also bring legal action\nunder the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nFinancing of the Transactions",

In connection with entering into the Dotdash Merger Agreement, and to facilitate the SpinCo Cash Payment obligations of Meredith (should the\nDotdash Merger not be completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger), Meredith has (i) terminated the Existing SpinCo\nCommitment Letter and (ii) entered the SpinCo Commitment Letter with the Commitment Parties on October 6, 2021, pursuant to which Meredith has\nreceived commitments from the Commitment Parties to provide to SpinCo (i) the Term Loan Facility, secured term loans in an aggregate principle amount\nof $725 and (2) the Revolving Facility, a secured revolving commitment in an aggregate principal amount of $150 million. The borrower under the Facilities\nwill be a designated subsidiary of NMG SpinCo and the obligations of the borrower will be guaranteed by NMG SpinCo and the subsidiaries of the\nborrower (subject to customary exceptions to be agreed). The amount of initial borrowings under the Facilities will be determined prior to the closing date\nof the Merger based on the total amount of funds necessary for NMG SpinCo to make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith (which, in turn, will depend\non the actual amount of Meredith\u2019s net debt on the closing date of the Merger) and to pay transaction fees and expenses.\nThe obligation of Meredith and Gray to consummate the Merger is subject to completion of the Distribution and Spin-Off. The obligation of Meredith to\nconsummate the Distribution and Spin-Off is subject to the consummation and funding of the Facilities in accordance with the SpinCo Commitment Letter\nand payment of the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nFunding of the Facilities is subject to customary conditions, including the negotiation of definitive documentation for the Facilities, that no material\nadverse effect on the financial condition, business or operations of SpinCo has occurred and other customary closing conditions consistent with the\nMerger Agreement and the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nAmong other termination rights, the obligations of the Commitment Parties under the SpinCo Commitment Letter will terminate automatically upon the\nearliest to occur of: (a) the earlier of (1) September 3, 2022 and (2) May 3, 2022 plus (x) in the event that the Separation shall not have been consummated\non or prior to such date due solely to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals (including any regulatory approvals required under the Merger\nAgreement, one automatic extension of three months and (y) if the Marketing Period (as defined in the SpinCo Commitment Letter) has commenced and\nhas not ended by the last business day immediately prior to May 3, 2022 (or if extended pursuant to the foregoing clause (x), the date that is three months\nfollowing such date), the fifth business day following the end of the Marketing Period, if in either case of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), the Closing\nDate shall not have occurred by such date, (b) consummation of the Separation without the funding of the facilities contemplated by the SpinCo\nCommitment Letter, (c) the date of execution and delivery of the definitive documentation for the Facilities, (d) the termination of the Separation and\nDistribution Agreement or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms prior to the funding of the Facilities and (e) the\nconsummation of the Dotdash Merger.\nFurther, the SpinCo Commitment Letter includes a customary marketing period to be completed prior to the closing date of the Facilities. Meredith is\nentitled to delay the Distribution until the date on which the proceeds of the SpinCo Debt Financing are available in full in accordance with the SpinCo\nCommitment Letter. Also, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the completion of the Merger will not occur prior to December 1, 2021, unless mutually\nagreed by the parties.\nThe Meredith Commitment Letter provides for an end date that is coterminous with the end date under the Merger Agreement.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, Meredith has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain financing for the transaction on the terms described\nabove.\n101\nTable of Contents\nIn the event Gray or Meredith is entitled to terminate, and elects to terminate, the Merger Agreement at the \u201cEnd Date\u201d (as defined in the Merger\nAgreement) prior to completion of the Merger and, at such time, all of the conditions to Meredith\u2019s obligation to consummate the Distribution, Spin-Off\nand Merger have been satisfied (other than the conditions that the SpinCo Debt Financing has been consummated and funded and that the SpinCo Cash\nPayment has been made), Meredith will be obligated to pay a termination fee to Gray in the amount of $73 million.\nGray\nGray anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to finance the transactions and to pay transaction fees and expenses will be approximately\n$2.89 billion. This amount is expected to be funded through one or more of the following sources: available cash on hand, the issuance and sale by Gray\nof notes in a public offering or in a Rule 144A private placement, and borrowings under the Gray term loan facility and bridge facility as described below.\nTo provide the debt financing required by Gray to consummate the Merger, Gray has entered into the Gray Commitment Letter, dated June 2, 2021\n(amending and restating its financing commitment letter, dated May 3, 2021) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and the other lenders party\nthereto, pursuant to which the lenders have committed to provide the debt financing for a portion of the purchase price to be paid to complete the Merger\nand the refinancing of certain existing indebtedness of Meredith, with an incremental term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.45 billion\nand a bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.475 billion less the principal amount of any notes issued prior to the date of completion of the\nMerger.

The number of shares subject to the adjusted Meredith stock option and the NMG SpinCo\nstock option will be equal to the number of shares subject to the related Meredith stock option prior to the Spin-Off, but the exercise prices will be\nadjusted to reflect the value of LMG RemainCo relative to NMG SpinCo based on the trading price of Meredith Common Stock on the last trading day\nimmediately prior to the Distribution Date relative to the \u201cwhen-issued\u201d trading price of NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day immediately\nprior to the Distribution Date (or, if a \u201cwhen-issued\u201d trading price is not available, the cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo\nCommon Stock under the Dotdash Merger Agreement). The sum of the exercise prices for the adjusted Meredith stock option and the NMG SpinCo stock\noption will equal the current exercise price of the related Meredith stock option prior to adjustment and the Spin-Off.

Prior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, holders of outstanding RSUs and Share-Based\nAwards granted under Meredith\u2019s equity plans will receive RSUs and Share-Based Awards in NMG SpinCo with respect to an equal number of shares\nsubject to the related Meredith award prior to the Spin-Off (in addition to Merger Consideration of $16.99 in respect of every share underlying such RSUs\nand Share-Based Awards). The NMG SpinCo RSUs and Share-Based Awards will generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the\nrelated Meredith award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo RSUs held by employees of LMG will be canceled and converted into\nthe right to receive a cash payment from NMG SpinCo equal to the \u201cwhen-issued\u201d trading price of NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day\nimmediately prior to the Distribution Date (or, if a \u201cwhen-issued\u201d trading price is not available, the cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG\nSpinCo Common Stock under the Dotdash Merger Agreement).\nWe encourage you to read the Employee Matters Agreement carefully.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement\nThe Tax Matters Agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of the Company, Gray and NMG SpinCo with respect to taxes,\ntax attributes, tax returns, tax contests and certain other tax matters in connection with the Spin-Off. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, (1) NMG\nSpinCo will be liable for all pre-closing taxes of the Company and NMG SpinCo and the post-closing taxes of NMG SpinCo, and (2) Gray will be liable for\nall transfer taxes imposed with respect to the Merger, all post-closing taxes of LMG RemainCo, and all taxes attributable to the station divestiture required\nto obtain regulatory approvals, subject to the specific terms and conditions of the Tax Matters Agreement. Additionally, the parties agreed that NMG\nSpinCo will prepare and Gray will file certain post-closing tax returns relating to pre-closing tax periods.\nWe encourage you to read the Tax Matters Agreement carefully.\nThe Transition Services Agreement\nUnder the Transition Services Agreement, Gray, the Company and NMG SpinCo agreed that NMG SpinCo will provide to LMG RemainCo on an interim,\ntransitional basis, various support services necessary for LMG RemainCo to be able to conduct business separate from the corporate functions of the\nCompany, which will be\n131\nTable of Contents\nheld by NMG SpinCo. The parties currently expect that such transitional services may include support with technology application services, technology\ninfrastructure services, network security services, benefits coverage matters, leave administration, finance operations, accounting matters, broadcast\noperations, and legal affairs.\nThe charges for these services are set forth on the schedules to the Transition Services Agreement. LMG RemainCo also agreed to reimburse NMG\nSpinCo for costs, fees and charges incurred in connection with performing the transition services. LMG RemainCo may, upon five days\u2019 notice, decline or\nreduce the scope of any of the transition services prior to the Spin-Off, or on fifteen days\u2019 notice during the term of the Transition Services Agreement. In\ngeneral, the services will begin on the date of the completion of the Spin-Off and will cover a period generally not expected to exceed four months\nfollowing the Spin-Off.\nWe encourage you to read the Transition Services Agreement carefully.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the\nMerger Proposal.\n132\nTable of Contents\nPROPOSAL 2\u2014ADVISORY VOTE ON COMPENSATION",

Such notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in\nreasonable detail and include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party\nClaim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of an Indemnified Party to provide notice in accordance with this Section 5.5(a) shall not relieve an\nIndemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent to which the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by\nthe Indemnified Party\u2019s failure to provide notice in accordance with this Section 5.5(a).\n(b) Subject to this Section 5.5(b) and Section 5.5(c), an Indemnifying Party may elect to control the defense of (and seek to settle or compromise), at its\nown expense and with its own counsel, any Third Party Claim\u037e provided that, prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming control of such defense it shall\nfirst (x) verify to the Indemnified Party in writing that such Indemnifying Party shall be fully responsible (with no reservation of any rights) for all\nliabilities and obligations relating to such claim for indemnification and that (without regard to any dollar limitations otherwise set forth herein) it shall\nprovide full indemnification (whether or not otherwise required hereunder) to the Indemnified Party with respect to such action, lawsuit, proceeding,\ninvestigation or other claim giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder and (y) enter into an agreement with the Indemnified Party in form and\nsubstance satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that unconditionally guarantees the payment and performance of any liability or obligation which may\narise with respect to such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder. Within thirty (30)\ndays after the receipt of notice from an Indemnified Party in accordance with Section 5.5(a) (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires),\nthe Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending the Third Party Claim\nand shall specify any reservations or exceptions to its defense. After receiving notice of an Indemnifying Party\u2019s election to assume the defense of a\nThird Party Claim, whether with or without any reservations or exceptions with respect to such defense, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to\nemploy separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the Indemnifying Party shall be\nresponsible for the fees and expenses of its counsel and, in any event, shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to\nthe Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party\u2019s expense, all witnesses, information and materials in such Indemnified Party\u2019s possession or under\nsuch Indemnified Party\u2019s control relating thereto\nD-26\nTable of Contents\nas are reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement (including Article IV hereof). If an\nIndemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, whether with or without any reservations or exceptions with respect to such\ndefense, then such Indemnifying Party shall be solely liable for all fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the defense of such Third Party\nClaim and shall not be entitled to seek any indemnification or reimbursement from the Indemnified Party for any such fees or expenses incurred during the\ncourse of its defense of such Third Party Claim, regardless of any subsequent decision by the Indemnifying Party to reject or otherwise abandon its\nassumption of such defense.\n(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.5(b), if any Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that (i) the Proceeding is criminal in nature, (ii) such Third Party\nClaim could reasonably have an adverse effect (reputational, economic or otherwise) that is material on the Indemnified Party and/or such Indemnified\nParty\u2019s Group, or otherwise materially impair any business relations of the Indemnified Party and/or such Indemnified Party\u2019s Group, or (iii) there is an\nactual conflict of interest if counsel for the Indemnifying Party represented both the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party\nshall have the right to employ separate counsel and to control the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the\nreasonable fees and expenses of one (1) separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties.\n(d) If an Indemnifying Party cannot or elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnified Party of its\nelection within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnified Party as provided in Section 5.5(b), the Indemnified Party may defend the\nThird Party Claim at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party is conducting the defense against any such Third Party\nClaim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying\nParty\u2019s expense, all witnesses, information and materials in such Indemnifying Party\u2019s possession or under such Indemnifying Party\u2019s control relating\nthereto as are reasonably required by the Indemnified Party, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement (including Article IV hereof).\n(e) Without the prior written consent of any Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no\nIndemnified Party may settle or compromise, or seek to settle or compromise, any Third Party Claim. Without the prior written consent of any Indemnified\nParty, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or\nenter into any settlement of any pending or threatened Third Party Claim for which the Indemnified Party is seeking or may seek indemnity pursuant to\nthis Section 5.5 unless such judgment or settlement is solely for monetary damages, does not impose any expense or obligation on the Indemnified Party,\ndoes not involve any finding or determination of wrongdoing or violation of law by the Indemnified Party and provides for a full, unconditional and\nirrevocable release of that Indemnified Party from all liability in connection with the Third Party Claim.\n5.6 Additional Matters.\n(a) Indemnification or contribution payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification or contribution\nunder this Article V shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party as such Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the Indemnified\nParty, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification or contribution payment, including\ndocumentation with respect to calculations made and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of such Liabilities. The\nindemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article V shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation\nmade by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party and (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnified Party of Liabilities for which it might be entitled to\nindemnification or contribution hereunder.\n(b) Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement which does not result from a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the\nIndemnified Party to the applicable Indemnifying Party\nD-27\nTable of Contents\ndescribing such claim in reasonable detail and including copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party\nrelating to such claim. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If\nsuch Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty (30)-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnified Party shall be free\nto pursue such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents without prejudice to\nits continuing rights to pursue indemnification or contribution hereunder.\n(c) If payment is made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying\nParty shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such\nIndemnified Party may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third Party\nClaim or against any other Person. Such Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and\nexpense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.\n(d) In an Action in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party shall so request, the\nparties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant if they conclude that substitution is desirable and practical. If such\nsubstitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow the Indemnifying Party to manage the\nAction as set forth in this Section 5.7(d), and the Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the named defendant against all costs of defending the Action\n(including court costs, sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys\u2019 fees, experts fees and all other external expenses), the costs of any judgment or\nsettlement, and the cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement.\n(e) For all Tax purposes, the Company and SpinCo agree to treat (i) any payment required by this Agreement (other than payments with respect to interest\naccruing after the Time of Distribution) as either a contribution by the Company to SpinCo or an assumption by SpinCo of a RemainCo Liability, as the\ncase may be, occurring immediately prior to the Time of Distribution, and (ii) any payment of interest as taxable or deductible, as the case may be, to the\nparty entitled under this Agreement to retain such payment or required under this Agreement to make such payment, in either case except as otherwise\nrequired by applicable Law.\n5.7 Remedies Cumulative\u037e Limitations of Liability. The rights provided in this Article V shall be cumulative and shall not preclude assertion by any\nIndemnified Party of any other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against any Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither\nSpinCo or its Affiliates, on the one hand, nor the Company or its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be liable to the other for any special, indirect,\npunitive, exemplary, remote, speculative, consequential or similar damages in excess of compensatory damages of the other arising in connection with the\nTransactions (provided, that any such liability with respect to a Third Party Claim shall be considered direct damages).\n5.8 Survival of Indemnities. The rights and obligations of each of the Company and SpinCo and their respective Indemnified Parties under this Article V\nshall survive the Distribution, the Effective Time and the sale or other transfer by any party of any Assets or businesses or the assignment by it of any\nLiabilities, including the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nARTICLE VI\nOTHER AGREEMENTS\n6.1 Further Assurances.\n(a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use (and\nwill cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates\nD-28\nTable of Contents\nto use) reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done,\nall things reasonably necessary on its part under applicable Law or contractual obligations to consummate and make effective the transactions\ncontemplated by this Agreement, including the Transactions, and the other Transaction Documents.
