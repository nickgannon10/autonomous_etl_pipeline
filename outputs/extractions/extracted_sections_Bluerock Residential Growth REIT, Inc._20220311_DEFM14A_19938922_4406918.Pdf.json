At the special meeting, holders of our Class A Common Stock,\n$0.01 par value per share (the \u201cClass A Common Stock\u201d), and our Class C Common Stock, $0.01 par value per\nshare (the \u201cClass C Common Stock\u201d and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), as\nof the record date, which was the close of business on March 7, 2022, will be asked to consider and vote on\n(1) a proposal to approve the merger (the \u201cproposal to approve the merger\u201d), (2) a proposal to approve, on a\nnon-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive\nofficers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the \u201cproposal to approve the merger-related\ncompensation\u201d) and (3) a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of\nsoliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger (the\n\u201cproposal to approve adjournment of the meeting\u201d).\nPursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law and our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the Notice\nof Special Meeting may be brought before the special meeting.\nRecord Date, Notice and Quorum\nAll stockholders of record of shares of our Common Stock as of the record date, which was the close of\nbusiness on March 7, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the special meeting or any\npostponement or adjournment of the special meeting. Each stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote on\neach matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class A Common Stock that such holder\nowned as of the record date, and will be entitled to cast 50 votes on each matter presented at the special\nmeeting for each share of Class C Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the\nrecord date, there were 29,260,629 shares of Class A Common Stock and 76,603 shares of Class C Common\nStock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.\n2 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe presence virtually via the special meeting website or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to\ncast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes\nof the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will\nbe counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not\npresent at the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later date. Pursuant\nto our bylaws, the board of directors may adjourn the meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, and\nreconvene as the board may determine (subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, including that\nin certain circumstances the special meeting may not be held, without Parent\u2019s consent, on a date that is\nmore than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).\nRequired Vote\nCompletion of the merger requires approval of the merger by the affirmative vote of the holders of the issued\nand outstanding Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger.\nEach stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each\nshare of Class A Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date, and will be entitled to cast 50\nvotes on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class C Common Stock that such\nholder owned as of the record date. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of\nvotes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to\nvote by proxy or at the special meeting via the special meeting website (including by abstaining), or fail to\ninstruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting\nagainst the proposal to approve the merger.\nEach of the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and the proposal to approve adjournment\nof the meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal. Approval of\nthese proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if\nyou fail to vote by proxy or at the special meeting via the special meeting website, or fail to instruct your\nbroker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals.\nAbstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of these\nproposals, assuming a quorum is present.\nThe vote of the holders of our Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cSeries B\nPreferred Stock\u201d), 7.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cSeries\nC Preferred Stock\u201d), 7.125% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cSeries D\nPreferred Stock\u201d), and Series T Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cSeries T Preferred\nStock\u201d), which we refer to collectively as \u201cPreferred Stock,\u201d is not required to approve any of the proposals\nat the special meeting and is not being solicited.\nAs of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of\napproximately 818,724 shares of our Class A Common Stock and approximately 72,964 shares of our Class C\nCommon Stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 13.50% of the voting power of our Common Stock\nentitled to vote at the special meeting, in each case including excess shares (as defined below). Our directors\nand executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares of Common Stock that they own\nin favor of the proposal to approve the merger, in favor of the proposal to approve the merger-related\ncompensation and in favor of the proposal to approve adjournment of the meeting. Under the Stockholders\nAgreement, dated October 31, 2017 among the Company and the stockholders party thereto (the\n\u201cstockholders agreement\u201d), if at any meeting of stockholders the holders of Class C Common Stock own\nshares of Class C Common Stock representing more than 9.9% of the voting rights of the then-outstanding\nCommon Stock (such shares, the \u201cexcess shares\u201d), then such holders shall vote such excess shares as\ndirected by the board of directors. Under the merger agreement, unless the board of directors effects a\ncompany adverse recommendation change, any excess shares must be voted in favor of the approval of the\nmerger. In addition, R. Ramin Kamfar, James G. Babb III, Ryan S. MacDonald, Jordan B. Ruddy, Michael L.\nKonig (who are members of our management) and certain of their affiliated entities, solely in their capacity as\nstockholders of the Company and limited partners of Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited\npartnership and the Company\u2019s operating partnership (the \u201coperating partnership\u201d or \u201cBluerock Residential\nHoldings\u201d), have entered into support agreements requiring, among other things, such persons to vote their\nshares of Common Stock, other than any excess shares, in favor of the proposal to\n3",

In addition, Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the\nmerger, Parent expects to cause the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities to be\nprepaid in full and our mortgage loans will be repaid or remain outstanding. As of December 31, 2021,\nnothing was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and we had approximately $1.37 billion in\nmortgage loans outstanding.\nParent has informed us that it is currently in the process of obtaining debt financing to be provided in\nconnection with the merger.

Parent has informed us that it\ncurrently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the debt financing would be secured by, among other\nthings, a mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned and/or ground leased by us, the direct\nand/or indirect equity interests in certain entities which own certain properties, certain escrows and reserves\nand such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the\napplicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the merger being completed and\nother customary conditions for similar financings.\nPursuant to the merger agreement, we have agreed to deliver, or we have agreed to use commercially\nreasonable efforts to cause any joint venture to deliver, promptly following Parent\u2019s request, a notice\nprepared by Parent, in form and substance reasonably approved by us, to each of the lenders under our\nexisting mortgage indebtedness requesting that such lender consent to, among other things, the\nconsummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to certain\nmodifications of the existing loan documents reasonably requested by Parent.

            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special\nmeeting and the proposed merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be\nimportant to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in\nthis proxy statement, as well as the additional documents to which it refers or which it incorporates by\nreference, including the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit\nA.\nWhat is the proposed transaction?\nThe proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by affiliates of Blackstone pursuant to the\nmerger agreement. After the merger has been approved by our common stockholders and the other\nclosing conditions under the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, the Company will merge\nwith and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company. The merger will occur\nat the time provided in the merger agreement.\nThe Company has agreed that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the\nCompany will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the separation of certain of the\nCompany\u2019s single-family properties and other assets (collectively, the \u201cBluerock Homes Business\u201d)\nfrom the remainder of our business and the distribution of Bluerock Homes common stock to our\ncommon stockholders. After the distribution is completed, Bluerock Homes will be a separate, externally\nmanaged, publicly traded REIT that will own and operate Bluerock Residential\u2019s single-family properties.\nThe separation and the distribution will be carried out in accordance with the terms of the separation\nprinciples. The completion of the separation and the distribution is a condition to the merger under the\nmerger agreement.\nFor additional information about the merger, please review the merger agreement, including the\nseparation principles, attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference into\nthis proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it\nis the principal document governing the merger.\nAs a common stockholder, what will I receive in the merger?\nFor each outstanding share of Common Stock that you own immediately prior to the merger effective\ntime, you will receive the merger consideration, which is $24.25 in cash, without interest and less any\napplicable withholding taxes. The merger consideration is in addition to the shares of Bluerock Homes\ncommon stock that our stockholders of record as of the record date for the distribution will be entitled\nto receive in the distribution.\nWill the shares of Bluerock Homes be publicly traded on an exchange?\nImmediately following the distribution, Bluerock Homes will be a publicly traded REIT. It will be a\ncondition to the distribution that the Bluerock Homes common stock that will be distributed in the\ndistribution has been approved for listing on the NYSE American, subject to official notice of\ndistribution, prior to the consummation of the distribution. Bluerock Homes expects that its common\nstock will be traded on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol \u201cBHM.\u201d\nWill I receive any regular quarterly dividends with respect to the shares of Common Stock that I own?\nOn December 10, 2021, our board of directors authorized and we declared a quarterly cash dividend of\n$0.1625 per share of Common Stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, which was paid in cash on\nJanuary 5, 2022, to holders of record of our Common Stock at the close of business on December 23,\n2021. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we may make, declare and pay regular quarterly cash\ndividends on Common Stock for the fiscal quarters ending March 30, 2022, and June 30, 2022, in\namounts up to $0.1625 per share per quarter (with record and payment dates consistent with historical\nrecord and payments dates for fiscal year 2021). Under the terms of the merger agreement, we may not\nauthorize, declare or pay any other dividends to the holders of shares of Common Stock for fiscal\nquarters ending after June 30, 2022, without the prior written consent of Parent, other than dividends\nreasonably determined to be required to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the\n15 Q: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npayment of income or excise tax or any other entity-level tax (with any such additional required dividend\nresulting in a corresponding decrease to the merger consideration).\nWhat will happen to my outstanding warrants in the merger?\nThe outstanding Company Warrants to purchase Common Stock will remain outstanding following the\nmerger effective time in accordance with their terms, but the terms of the warrant agreements with\nrespect to the Company Warrants will be adjusted so that the holder of any Company Warrant exercised\nafter the merger effective time will be entitled to receive in cash the amount of the merger consideration\nthat, if the Company Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the merger effective time, such\nholder would have been entitled to receive upon the consummation of the merger.\nWhat will happen to the Company\u2019s Dividend Reinvestment Plans (\u201cDRIPs\u201d) in the merger?\nOn December 19, 2021, the board of directors approved the suspension of the DRIPs with respect to our\nClass A Common Stock and Series T Preferred Stock until further notice, as required pursuant to the\nmerger agreement. Prior to the merger effective time, pursuant to the merger agreement, the board of\ndirectors will adopt resolutions or take other actions required to terminate the DRIPs effective prior to,\nbut subject to the occurrence of, the merger effective time.\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nIf our common stockholders vote to approve the merger, and assuming that the other conditions to the\nmerger are satisfied or waived, it is currently anticipated that the merger will be completed in the second\nquarter of 2022. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the closing of the merger will take place on the third\nbusiness day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger described under \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fConditions to the Merger\u201d  (other than (1) those conditions that by their nature are to be\nsatisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, and\n(2) the consummation of the separation and the distribution, but subject to the consummation of the\nseparation and the distribution prior to the merger effective time) or on such other date as may be\nmutually agreed in writing by us and Parent. For further information regarding the timing of the closing\nof the merger, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fEffective Time\u037e Closing Date.\u201d\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nIf the merger is not approved by our common stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any\nother reason, our common stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock\npursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, Bluerock Residential will remain a public company and\nshares of Common Stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed on the NYSE\nAmerican. Upon a termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, we will be required\nto pay Parent the company termination fee. In certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay\nus the parent termination fee upon termination of the merger agreement.\nIf the merger is completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares of Common Stock?\nFollowing the completion of the merger, your shares of Common Stock will automatically be converted\ninto the right to receive your portion of the merger consideration. Shortly after the merger is completed,\nyou will receive instructions describing how you may surrender your shares of Common Stock for the\nmerger consideration. If your shares of Common Stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or\nother nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action,\nif any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the merger\nconsideration.\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\nThe special meeting will be held on April 12, 2022, at 11:00 a.m., New York time. The special meeting will\nbe held solely via live webcast, and there will not be a physical meeting location, given the current\npublic health impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and our desire to promote the health and safety of our\nstockholders, as well as our directors, officers, employees and other constituents.\n16 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWho can vote and attend the special meeting?\nAll holders of record of shares of Common Stock as of the record date, which was the close of business\non March 7, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the special meeting or any\npostponement or adjournment of the special meeting. Each stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote\non each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class A Common Stock that such\nholder owned as of the record date, and will be entitled to cast 50 votes on each matter presented at the\nspecial meeting for each share of Class C Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date.\nThe vote of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock is not required to approve any of the proposals at\nthe special meeting and is not being solicited.\nWhat vote of common stockholders is required to approve the merger?\nApproval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of issued and outstanding Common\nStock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger. Because the required\nvote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast\nrather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including failure\nto give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same\neffect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve the merger.\nWhat vote of common stockholders is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation\nthat may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nmerger?\nApproval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable\nto our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger requires the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure\nto vote your shares of Common Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank\nor other nominee) and abstentions will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.\nWhat vote of common stockholders is required to approve adjournments of the special meeting?\nApproval of any adjournment of the special meeting to solicit additional proxies if there are not\nsufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure to vote your shares of\nCommon Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and\nabstentions will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.\nWhy is my vote important?\nIf you do not authorize your proxy or voting instructions or vote at the special meeting via the special\nmeeting website, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the special\nmeeting. In addition, because the proposal to approve the merger must be approved by the affirmative\nvote of the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger by\nthe holders of issued and outstanding Common Stock, your failure to authorize your proxy or voting\ninstructions or to vote at the special meeting via the special meeting website will have the same effect as\na vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the approval of the merger.\nWill I also vote on any proposals to approve the separation and the distribution?\nNo. No vote of Company stockholders is required to approve the separation and the distribution.\nHow does the merger consideration compare to the market price of the Company\u2019s shares of Common Stock?\nThe merger consideration of $24.25 per share in cash (without taking into account the value of the\nshares of Bluerock Homes to be received by holders of Common Stock in the distribution) represents a\npremium of approximately 124% to the unaffected closing price of $10.85 on September 15, 2021, the last\ntrading day prior to Bloomberg\u2019s report, on September 16, 2021, that the Company was evaluating\nstrategic alternatives.\n17 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHow does our board of directors recommend that I vote?\nOur board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the merger, \u201cFOR\u201d the\nproposal to approve the merger-related compensation, and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve adjournment\nof the meeting.\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related\ncompensation payable to our named executive officers?\nThe SEC has adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve\ncertain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based\non or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the merger.\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related\ncompensation?\nThe proposal to approve the merger-related compensation is a proposal separate and apart from the\nproposal to approve the merger. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the\nmerger. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our board of\ndirectors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject\nto stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is\ncompleted, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or\nbecome payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, in accordance with the\nterms and conditions applicable to such compensation.\nDo any of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have any interests in the merger that are different\nthan mine?\nOur directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in\naddition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. See \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of Our Directors\nand Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d for additional information about interests that our directors and\nexecutive officers have in the merger that are different than yours.\nWhat do I need to do now?\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the\nexhibits attached to this proxy statement, please vote your shares of Common Stock or authorize a proxy\nto vote your shares of Common Stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. You will\nbe entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class A\nCommon Stock that you owned as of the record date, and you will be entitled to cast 50 votes on each\nmatter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class C Common Stock that you owned as of\nthe record date.\nHow do I cast my vote?\nIf you are a holder of record of Common Stock on the record date, you may vote at the special meeting\nvia the special meeting website or authorize a proxy to vote your shares of Common Stock at the special\nmeeting. You can authorize your proxy by marking, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy\ncard by mail, or, if you prefer, by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions\nincluded with your proxy card. Specific instructions to be followed by stockholders of record interested\nin authorizing a proxy via the Internet or by telephone are shown on the accompanying proxy card.\nInternet and telephone procedures are designed to authenticate the stockholder\u2019s identity and to allow\nstockholders to authorize a proxyholder to vote the stockholder\u2019s shares and confirm that their\ninstructions have been properly recorded. A stockholder that authorizes a vote through the Internet\nshould understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges\nfrom Internet access providers and telephone companies, which will be borne by the stockholder.\n18 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHow do I cast my vote if my shares of Common Stock are held of record in a \u201cstreet name\u201d?\nIf your shares are held in a \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must direct your\nintermediary regarding how you would like your shares voted by following the voting instructions you\nreceive from your broker, bank or other nominee\u037e or, if you want to participate in the special meeting,\nyou must follow the instructions you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee.\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?\nWith respect to the proposal to approve the merger, if you abstain from voting and fail to cast your vote\nat the special meeting via the special meeting website or by proxy, or if you hold your shares of\nCommon Stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other\nnominee, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger. With respect to the proposal to\napprove the merger-related compensation and the proposal to approve adjournment of the meeting, if\nyou abstain from voting and you fail to cast your vote at the special meeting via the special meeting\nwebsite or by proxy, or if you hold your shares of Common Stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give\nvoting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of\nsuch proposals.\nHow will proxy holders vote my shares of Common Stock?\nIf you properly authorize a proxy prior to the special meeting, your shares of Common Stock will be\nvoted as you direct. If you authorize a proxy but no direction is otherwise made, your shares of\nCommon Stock will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the merger, \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve\nthe merger-related compensation and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve adjournment of the meeting.\nPursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law and our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the\nNotice of Special Meeting may be brought before the special meeting.\nWhat happens if I sell shares of Common Stock before the special meeting?\nIf you held shares of Common Stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective\ntime, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but not the right to receive the merger\nconsideration for those shares. The right to receive such consideration when the merger becomes\neffective will pass to the person who at that time owns the shares of Common Stock you previously\nowned.\nCan I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?\nYes. If you own shares of Common Stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a\npreviously authorized proxy at any time before it is exercised by filing with our Secretary a notice of\nrevocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending the meeting and voting via the\nspecial meeting website. Attendance at the meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a\npreviously authorized proxy. If you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares\nof Common Stock, the foregoing options for changing your vote do not apply, and instead you must\nfollow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.\nIs the merger expected to be taxable to me?\nYes. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the merger, taken together\nwith the distribution, is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete liquidation of the Company\nand will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of\nshares of Common Stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an\namount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the sum of (A) the amount of cash received with\nrespect to such U.S. holder\u2019s shares of Common Stock in the merger plus (B) the fair market value,\ndetermined when the distribution occurs, of the shares of Bluerock Homes common stock received in\nthe distribution, and (2) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Common Stock. The U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of the distribution and the merger will depend on\nvarious factors, including whether the receipt of such distributions and payments are treated as\ndistributions from the Company that are attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs pursuant to the\nprovisions of FIRPTA.

You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of\nthe merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state,\nlocal or foreign income and other tax laws). For further discussion, see \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences.\u201d\nWhat rights do I have if I oppose the merger?\nIf you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the proposal to\napprove the merger. You are not, however, entitled to exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or\nthe rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder\u2019s shares in connection\nwith the merger because, as permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter provides\nthat stockholders are not entitled to exercise any such rights unless our board of directors, upon the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors, determines that such rights apply. Our board of\ndirectors has made no such determination. See \u201cNo Dissenters\u2019 Rights of Appraisal.\u201d\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nWe intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that\nwe file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov when filed.\nHave any stockholders entered into a support agreement in connection with the merger?\nYes. Certain holders of Common Stock (R. Ramin Kamfar, James G. Babb III, Ryan S. MacDonald, Jordan\nB. Ruddy, Michael L. Konig (who are members of our management) and certain of their affiliated\nentities), solely in their capacity as our stockholders and limited partners of our operating partnership,\nhave entered into support agreements with Parent pursuant to which the holders agreed, among other\nthings, (i) to vote their respective covered shares other than any excess shares, in favor of the approval\nof the merger, (ii) to vote their respective covered shares, other than any excess shares, against any\ncompany takeover proposal and any other action that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere\nwith, delay, materially delay, materially postpone or adversely affect the merger or the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement or result in a breach in any material respect of any of the\ncovenants, representations or warranties or other obligations or agreements of us under the merger\nagreement, of us or Bluerock Homes under the separation documentation or of such holder under the\napplicable support agreement, and (iii) not to transfer their respective covered shares, in each case,\nsubject to certain exceptions.\nAs of the record date, the covered shares represented approximately 11.69% of the outstanding voting\npower of our Common Stock after giving effect to the voting provisions relating to \u201cExcess Shares\u201d  (as\ndefined in the stockholders agreement). Under the stockholders agreement, if at any meeting of\nstockholders the holders of Class C Common Stock own shares of Class C Common Stock representing\nmore than 9.9% of the voting rights of the then-outstanding Common Stock (such shares, the \u201cexcess\nshares\u201d), then such holders shall vote such excess shares as directed by the board of directors. Under\nthe merger agreement, unless the board of directors effects a company adverse recommendation change,\nany excess shares (which represented approximately 1.67% of the outstanding voting power of our\nCommon Stock as of the record date) must be voted in favor of the approval of the merger. The support\nagreements automatically terminate upon the earlier of (i) the merger effective time and (ii) the\ntermination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Support\nAgreements.\u201d\nCan I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?\nIf you are unable to attend the meeting via the special meeting website, we encourage you to complete,\nsign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or\nthrough the Internet.\n20 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhere can I find more information about the Company?\nWe file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov and on\nour website at www.bluerockresidential.com.

The effectiveness of the Form 10 is a condition to the consummation of\nthe separation and distribution which, in turn, is a condition to the consummation of the merger.

Our directors and executive\nofficers have informed us that they intend to vote the Common Stock that they own in favor of the proposal\nto approve the merger, in favor of the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and in favor of\nthe proposal to approve adjournment of the meeting.

        "Background of the Merger": {
            "text": "Background of the Merger\nOur management and board of directors regularly review our performance and prospects in light of the\ncurrent business, economic, capital markets and real estate environments, as well as developments in the\nmulti-family and single-family residential real estate businesses and the opportunities and challenges facing\nparticipants in those businesses. These reviews have included consideration, from time to time, of potential\nstrategic alternatives that could, taking into account market cycles and the level of investor demand for asset\nclasses represented in our portfolio, enhance and realize the value of our portfolio for our stockholders,\nincluding potential acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and business combination transactions, as well\nas remaining an independent standalone company. In connection with these reviews, our management from\ntime to time evaluates the properties in our portfolio, individually and collectively, and opportunities to\nenhance and realize the value of such properties for our stockholders. Our board of directors and\nmanagement have also considered the potential benefits that might result from enabling greater strategic and\nmanagement focus within our single-family residential real estate business by separating it from our multi-\nfamily residential real estate business and spinning it off to our stockholders as a standalone public\ncompany, which would also provide an opportunity for stockholders to invest only in our single-family\nresidential business.\nOn July 27, 2021, the board of directors held a meeting which was attended by management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, outside legal counsel to the Company (\u201cWachtell\nLipton\u201d), and KVCF, PLC, outside legal counsel to the Company (\u201cKVCF\u201d). During this meeting, the board of\ndirectors, with the assistance of management, reviewed our business performance and outlook in light of\ngeneral market conditions and considered opportunities and risks in our multi-family and single-family\nresidential real estate businesses. The directors discussed, among other matters, management\u2019s assessment\nthat the accumulation of available equity capital for stabilized multi-family residential real estate assets\nresulting in low capitalization rates for those assets, strong revenue fundamentals in the multi-family\nresidential real estate market in the sunbelt region, increasing supply of multi-family residential real estate\nassets, as well as the possibility of interest rate increases in the future, coupled with improvements in the\noutlook for the single-family residential real estate market and opportunities for margin improvement and\nvalue creation in the Company\u2019s portfolio of single-family residential real estate assets, presented an\nopportune environment for the Company to explore a potential strategic transaction involving the sale of our\nportfolio of multi-family residential real estate. The directors discussed with management and our advisors\nthe advantages and disadvantages of potential transaction structures, including with respect to tax\nefficiency and the allocation of risk, and that a transaction involving a sale of our portfolio of multi-family\nresidential real estate assets and a spin-off to our stockholders of our portfolio of single-family residential\nreal estate assets offered several advantages relative to alternative transaction structures. R. Ramin Kamfar,\nour chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, conveyed management\u2019s belief, which the\nboard of directors agreed with, that it would be in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders for\nthe board of directors to receive the assistance of one or more financial advisors to assess and pursue\npotential strategic opportunities, including a sale of our portfolio of multi-family residential real estate assets\nand a spin-off to our stockholders of our portfolio of single-family residential real estate assets, and the\nboard of directors discussed potential financial advisors. The Company later selected Morgan Stanley,\nEastdil Secured Advisors LLC (\u201cEastdil\u201d) and BofA Securities, Inc. (\u201cBank of America\u201d), based on their\nqualifications, expertise and reputation in our sector, and their knowledge of the business and affairs of the\nCompany and of potential counterparties, to serve as our financial advisors in connection with a potential\nstrategic transaction.\nFollowing the July 27, 2021 meeting of the board of directors, the Company, at the direction of the board of\ndirectors and with the assistance of its advisors, confirmed the optimal transaction structure and\n34 TABLE OF CONTENTS\ndesigned a process for the sale of our portfolio of multi-family residential real estate assets and a spin-off to\nour stockholders of our portfolio of single-family residential real estate assets. Throughout August and\ncontinuing through the first week of September 2021, the Company began to prepare for outreach to\npotential transaction counterparties after Labor Day 2021 and to assemble due diligence information that\ncould be made available to potential transaction counterparties. Also during this period, the Company began\nto consider retaining additional advisors to assess and opine on aspects of the potential separation\ntransaction, including the external management of Bluerock Homes. The Company, at the direction of the\nboard of directors, later in the process selected Duff & Phelps to provide advice with respect to the\nseparation and the distribution, including the Exchange, and Stanger to provide advice with respect to terms\nof a Management Agreement to be entered into by Bluerock Homes and an external manager that would be\nowned by certain members of the Company\u2019s management (the \u201cManager\u201d). The Company selected Duff &\nPhelps and Stanger based on their qualifications, expertise and reputation, and their knowledge of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Company.\nOver the course of the period between September 8, 2021, and September 16, 2021, representatives of Morgan\nStanley and Eastdil, at the Company\u2019s direction, contacted 16 parties identified by the Company, Morgan\nStanley and Eastdil as potentially having an interest in a potential transaction with the Company, including\nBlackstone on September 9, 2021.\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company received a written indication of interest from a third party (\u201cParty A\u201d)\nsetting forth the terms of an unsolicited, non-binding offer to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of the\nCompany in an all-cash transaction at a price of $13.89 per share.\nOn September 16, 2021, Bloomberg reported that the Company was evaluating strategic alternatives (the\n\u201cSeptember 16 Bloomberg article\u201d). Thereafter, 38 additional parties contacted the Company, Morgan Stanley\nor Eastdil regarding a potential transaction. The Company and our financial advisors invited all such parties\nto enter into non-disclosure agreements. Of the 55 total parties (including Party A), 28 executed non-\ndisclosure agreements with the Company.\nOn September 20, 2021, the board of directors held a meeting, with representatives of Wachtell Lipton and\nKVCF in attendance. The directors discussed the latest developments in our assessment of a potential\nstrategic transaction. The board of directors also discussed the written indication of interest received from\nParty A. The board of directors determined to instruct Morgan Stanley to invite Party A to participate in the\nstrategic transaction process, which would involve Party A entering into a non-disclosure agreement and\nconducting due diligence, in order to allow Party A to submit a more attractive proposal.\nDuring the last week of September and continuing through the first half of November 2021, the potential\ntransaction counterparties that had executed non-disclosure agreements received access to a virtual data\nroom containing information regarding our multi-family residential real estate portfolio and were able to\nconduct due diligence, including through telephone calls and videoconferences with our management and\nour advisors.\nOn October 18, 2021, at the Company\u2019s direction, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil provided a\nprocess letter (the \u201cOctober 18 process letter\u201d) to the 28 potential transaction counterparties that had\nexecuted non-disclosure agreements, which letter invited such parties to submit, no later than November 9,\n2021, non-binding indications of interest regarding a transaction to acquire the Company. The October 18\nprocess letter indicated that the Company, at the time of sale, would consist of only our interest in our 30\nmulti-family residential real estate operating assets and mezzanine and preferred investments in 25 multi-\nfamily residential real estate assets.\nOn November 2, 2021, the board of directors held a meeting to discuss various matters and received an\nupdate from representatives of management regarding the potential strategic transaction process, including\nwith respect to the potential transaction counterparties that had executed non-disclosure agreements and\ntheir due diligence activity to date.\nOver the course of November 9, 2021, and November 10, 2021, 10 potential transaction counterparties\nsubmitted non-binding indications of interest for our multi-family residential real estate portfolio. The initial\nindications of interest contemplated gross asset values between $2.6 billion and $3.5 billion for the assets\nthat the Company would own at the time of the potential transaction. Of the 10 proposals received from\n35 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npotential transaction counterparties, the four highest contemplated gross asset valuations of at least $3.2\nbillion: one potential transaction counterparty (\u201cParty B\u201d) proposed a $3.5 billion gross asset valuation of\nthe assets proposed to be sold in the potential transaction, while Blackstone and another potential\ntransaction counterparty (\u201cParty C\u201d) each proposed a $3.4 billion gross asset valuation, and another\npotential transaction counterparty (\u201cParty D\u201d) proposed a $3.2 billion gross asset valuation. Party A\nsubmitted a proposal that contemplated a $2.9 billion gross asset value. No potential transaction\ncounterparty expressed interest in any of our assets other than the multi-family residential real estate\nportfolio.\nFollowing the submission of the initial non-binding indications of interest, the Company and representatives\nof Morgan Stanley and Eastdil considered how to continue the process. The Company, in consultation with\nMorgan Stanley and Eastdil, believed that, subject to approval by the board of directors, the optimal path\nforward was to invite the four highest bidders into the second round of the process, and inform the\nremaining parties that submitted indications of interest that they would have to increase the value of their\nproposals in order to participate in the next round of bidding. On November 16, 2021, the Company directed\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil to invite, subject to the approval of the board of directors,\neach of Blackstone and Parties B, C and D to participate in a second phase of due diligence and thereafter to\nsubmit a best and final proposal, including the price per share of Common Stock, at which such party would\nbe willing to acquire the Company at a time when it would consist only of our multi-family residential real\nestate portfolio. Each such party was requested to submit, no later than December 6, 2021, a mark-up of a\ndraft merger agreement to be provided to each such party, and to submit its best and final proposal no later\nthan December 15, 2021. All potential transaction counterparties that submitted initial indications of interest\nother than Blackstone and Parties B, C and D were advised by representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nEastdil, on behalf of the Company, that they would have to increase the value of their proposals in order to\nparticipate in the next round of bidding. None of these other parties increased the value of their proposals.\nOn November 18, 2021, the board of directors met to discuss the status of the strategic transaction process,\nwith representatives of management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Eastdil, Wachtell Lipton and\nKVCF in attendance. During the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil presented an\noverview of the initial indications of interest and the plan proposed by the Company in consultation with its\nadvisors to advance the four highest bidders to the second round of the process and invite others to\nimprove their proposals in order to remain in the process. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with\nthe directors their duties in connection with their consideration of potential strategic alternatives for the\nCompany. Following the presentations from our advisors and discussion among the directors, the board of\ndirectors directed our management and financial advisors to continue to engage with each of Blackstone and\nParties B, C and D in order to be in a position, following the receipt of best and final proposals on December\n15, 2021, to expeditiously enter into definitive transaction documentation with one of such parties if the\nCompany were to receive an acceptable proposal.\nDuring the course of November 18, 2021, and November 19, 2021, management and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley, Eastdil and Wachtell Lipton held separate videoconferences with Blackstone, Party C and\nParty D in order to discuss the transaction structure and the process by which the Bluerock Homes Business\nwould be separated from the remainder of our business. Party B scheduled a videoconference with\nmanagement and its advisors, to be held on November 22, 2021, in order to receive an overview of the\nproposed transaction structure and the process by which the Bluerock Homes Business would be separated\nfrom the remainder of our business, but subsequently cancelled the meeting and did not reschedule.\nAlso on November 19, 2021, a draft merger agreement was provided to Blackstone and Parties B, C and D in\nthe virtual data room. The proposed draft of the merger agreement provided for, among other things: (1) the\nseparation of the Bluerock Homes Business from our multi-family residential real estate business and the\ndistribution of shares of Bluerock Homes common stock to our stockholders as contemplated by separation\nprinciples that would be attached to the merger agreement, (2) an outside date of nine months from the date\nof the agreement, after which date the merger agreement would be terminable by either party if the potential\ntransaction had not yet been completed, (3) a termination fee equal to 3.0% of the Company\u2019s equity value\nimplied by the transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by the Company upon a termination of the\nmerger agreement under certain circumstances, (4) a reverse termination fee equal to 10.0% of the Company\u2019s\nequity value implied by the transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by\n36 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe purchaser upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances and (5) the right of\nthe Company to continue to pay, during the pendency of the merger, a quarterly cash dividend to holders of\nCommon Stock not in excess of $0.17 per share per quarter.\nOn November 23, 2021, and November 24, 2021, respectively, Party B and Party D separately indicated to\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil that they would not be prepared to provide an actionable\nproposal on December 15, 2021, and that they each were uncertain about their ability to make such a\nproposal even with a greater amount of time. Party B and Party D were each advised by representatives of\nMorgan Stanley and Eastdil that, although the Company did not presently intend to extend the deadline for\nthe submission of proposals, each such party should continue to perform due diligence. However, both Party\nB and Party D ceased their due diligence activity in the virtual data room and did not thereafter contact the\nCompany or our advisors with respect to a potential transaction.\nThroughout the second half of November and the first half of December 2021, Blackstone and Party C, with\nthe assistance of their advisors, conducted additional due diligence with respect to the Company and its\nmulti-family residential real estate portfolio and discussed the structure of the potential transaction,\nincluding through telephone calls and videoconferences with our management and our advisors, including\nMorgan Stanley, Eastdil, Wachtell Lipton, KVCF and Vinson & Elkins LLP, tax counsel to the Company, as\nwell as due diligence site visits at certain properties within our multi-family residential real estate portfolio. In\nthese discussions, representatives of Morgan Stanley, Eastdil and Wachtell Lipton communicated to each of\nBlackstone and Party C that they were not the only potential transaction counterparty that had submitted a\ncompelling initial indication of interest, and that any final proposals submitted by such parties should take\ninto account this competitive dynamic, including with respect to purchase price and contract terms.\nOn November 27, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil, at the Company\u2019s direction, provided\na draft of the separation principles to each of Blackstone and Party C. The draft of the separation principles\nprovided for, among other things, a target cash level for the Company (after giving effect to separation of the\nBluerock Homes Business) at the closing of the merger, with all cash above that amount to be contributed to\nthe Bluerock Homes Business.\nOn December 1, 2021, representatives of Party C delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton, ahead of the December 6 deadline for comments to the merger agreement.\nAmong other terms, the revised draft of the merger agreement submitted by Party C provided for, among\nother things: (1) an outside date of six months from the date of the agreement, after which date the merger\nagreement would be terminable by either party if the potential transaction had not yet been completed, (2) a\ntermination fee equal to 4.0% of the Company\u2019s equity value implied by the transaction, including Preferred\nStock, payable by the Company upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, (3)\nreimbursement by the Company of Party C\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the\ntransaction in the event of a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, (4) a reverse\ntermination fee equal to 10.0% of the Company\u2019s equity value implied by the transaction, including Preferred\nStock, payable by Party C upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances and (5)\nthe right of the Company to pay, during the pendency of the merger, up to two quarterly cash dividends to\nholders of Common Stock, not in excess of $0.1625 per share per quarter. The revised draft of the merger\nagreement did not include a financing contingency.\nThereafter, between December 1, 2021, and December 6, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton exchanged\ndrafts of the transaction documentation and discussed various terms thereof with representatives of Party C\nwith a view towards improving the terms of Party C\u2019s final proposal. Among other things, Party C was\ninformed numerous times that the outside date, and its impact on the certainty of closing given the potential\ntimeline to consummate the separation and the distribution, was a critical factor on which best and final\nproposals would be evaluated.\nOn December 6, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley, on behalf of the Company, informed Blackstone\nthat the Company had already been negotiating transaction documentation with at least one other potential\ntransaction party and that Blackstone should assume that, by the December 6, 2021 deadline, the Company\nwould have received at least one merger agreement that were substantially acceptable to the Company from a\npotential transaction counterparty whose initial indications of interest was at or above the valuation of the\nmulti-family residential real estate portfolio proposed by Blackstone in its initial indication of interest.\n37 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 6, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to\nrepresentatives of Party C that provided for, among other things: (1) an outside date of six months from the\ndate of the agreement, which would be extended to nine months from the date of the agreement in certain\ncircumstances that would render the distribution unable to be completed within six months, (2) a termination\nfee equal to 4.0% of the Company\u2019s equity value implied by the transaction, including Preferred Stock,\npayable by the Company upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, (3)\nreimbursement by the Company of Party C\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the\ntransaction in the event of a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, subject to a\nmaximum reimbursement of 0.5% of the Company\u2019s equity value implied by the transaction, including\nPreferred Stock, which reimbursement would be credited against any termination fee that became payable, (4)\na reverse termination fee equal to 10.0% of the Company\u2019s equity value implied by the transaction, including\nPreferred Stock, payable by Party C upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances\nand (5) the right of the Company to pay, during the pendency of the merger, up to three quarterly cash\ndividends to holders of Common Stock, not in excess of $0.1625 per share per quarter.\nRepresentatives of Party C characterized the revised draft of the merger agreement as substantially\nacceptable to Party C, subject to any revisions from lenders providing financing to Party C in connection\nwith a potential transaction.\nAlso on December 6, 2021, representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel to Blackstone\n(\u201cSimpson Thacher\u201d), delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell\nLipton. The revised draft of the merger agreement provided for, among other things: (1) an outside date of\nnine months from the date of the agreement that could be extended by Blackstone for an additional three\nmonths in the event that all conditions to closing had been satisfied other than the completion of the\nseparation and the distribution, (2) a termination fee equal to 3.0% of the Company\u2019s equity value implied by\nthe transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by the Company upon a termination of the merger\nagreement under certain circumstances, (3) a reverse termination fee equal to 10.0% of the Company\u2019s equity\nvalue implied by the transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by Blackstone upon a termination of the\nmerger agreement under certain circumstances and (4) the right of the Company to pay, during the pendency\nof the merger, a quarterly cash dividend to holders of Common Stock in December 2021 and for the first two\nfiscal quarters of 2022, not in excess of $0.1625 per share per quarter. The revised draft of the merger\nagreement did not include a financing contingency, but provided that the Company would not have a right to\nspecific performance to require Blackstone to complete the merger. The revised draft of the merger agreement\nalso indicated that Blackstone would expect to receive support agreements from holders of our Class C\ncommon stock, including from Mr. Kamfar, our chairman and chief executive officer. Under the stockholders\nagreement, dated October 31, 2017 among us and the stockholders party thereto (the \u201cstockholders\nagreement\u201d), if at any meeting of stockholders such holders own shares of Class C Common Stock\nrepresenting more than 9.9% of the voting rights of our then-outstanding common stock, then such holders\nmust vote such excess shares as directed by the board of directors. The revised draft of the merger\nagreement also provided that unless the board of directors effected a company adverse recommendation\nchange, any such excess shares would be required to be voted in favor of the approval of the merger.\nRepresentatives of Simpson Thacher also delivered on December 6, 2021, a revised draft of the separation\nprinciples to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. The revised draft of the separation principles provided for,\namong other things, a target cash level for the Bluerock Homes Business at the closing of the merger, with\ncash in excess of such amount to be retained by the Company.\nThereafter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed various terms of the draft merger agreement and\nother transaction documents with representatives of Simpson Thacher.\nOn December 10, 2021, representatives of Simpson Thacher provided to representatives of Wachtell Lipton a\ndraft form of support agreement to be executed by holders of our Class C common stock.\nOn December 14, 2021, Party C submitted a revised draft of the merger agreement reflecting comments from\nthe lenders providing financing to Party C in connection with a potential transaction, along with revised\ndrafts of the separation principles, equity commitment letter and limited guarantee. Among other revisions,\n38 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe revised draft of the merger agreement submitted by Party C provided for: (1) an outside date of six\nmonths from the date of the agreement, without the possibility of an extension to nine months from the date\nof the agreement and (2) the right of the Company to pay, during the pendency of the merger, up to two, but\nnot three, quarterly cash dividends to holders of Common Stock, not in excess of $0.1625 per share per\nquarter.\nOn December 15, 2021, Party C submitted a proposal to acquire the Company (after the separation and\ndistribution of the Bluerock Homes Business) for $22.22 in cash per share of Common Stock, reflecting a\ngross asset value of $3.5 billion. Party C did not alter its position that the merger agreement should provide\nfor a six month outside date.\nOn December 15, 2021, Blackstone submitted a written proposal to acquire the Company for $23.25 in cash\nper share of Common Stock. In its letter, Blackstone noted that it had sufficient fully discretionary equity\ncapital to complete the acquisition of the Company without any partners, and also indicated that it had\ncompleted all of its due diligence and was prepared to sign binding definitive documentation as soon as\npossible. Blackstone included with its written proposal revised drafts of the merger agreement and the\nseparation principles. The revised draft of the merger agreement provided for, among other things: (1) an\noutside date of nine months from the date of the agreement, which could be extended in certain\ncircumstances by the Company to up to 10 months, and by Blackstone to up to 12 months from the date of\nthe merger agreement, (2) a termination fee equal to 3.0% of the Company\u2019s equity value implied by the\ntransaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by the Company upon a termination of the merger agreement\nunder certain circumstances, (3) a reverse termination fee equal to 10.0% of the Company\u2019s equity value\nimplied by the transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by Blackstone upon a termination of the\nmerger agreement under certain circumstances and (4) the right of the Company to pay, during the pendency\nof the merger, a quarterly cash dividend to holders of Common Stock in December 2021 and for the first two\nfiscal quarters of 2022, not in excess of $0.1625 per share per quarter.\nFollowing submission of Blackstone\u2019s proposal, representatives of Morgan Stanley, on behalf of the\nCompany, contacted representatives of Blackstone to encourage Blackstone to increase its bid. Blackstone\nthereafter engaged in multiple discussions with representatives of Morgan Stanley which culminated in\nBlackstone\u2019s oral submission on December 15, 2021, which was confirmed in writing on the morning of\nDecember 16, 2021, of a proposal to acquire the Company (after the separation and distribution of the\nBluerock Homes Business) for $24.25 in cash per share of Common Stock.\nOn December 16, 2021, the board of directors held a special meeting to review and consider the proposals\nsubmitted by Blackstone and Party C, which meeting was attended by representatives of Morgan Stanley,\nWachtell Lipton, KVCF, Duff & Phelps and Stanger. Representatives of Morgan Stanley presented their\npreliminary valuation analyses of the Company, and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Wachtell Lipton\nreviewed the terms of the proposals and draft merger agreements and other transaction documents submitted\nby Blackstone and Party C, each of which provided for an acquisition of the Company, after the distribution\nof shares of Bluerock Homes common stock to our common stockholders, at a significant premium to the\nunaffected closing price of $10.85 on September 15, 2021, the last day prior to the September 16 Bloomberg\narticle reporting that the Company was considering strategic alternatives. The directors, management and\nour advisors discussed Blackstone\u2019s experience in acquiring real estate assets and its substantial available\ncapital, as well as Blackstone\u2019s willingness to provide for an outside date that could be extended by the\nCompany to up to 10 months after execution of the merger agreement in order to accommodate the potential\ntimeline to consummate the separation and distribution. The directors, management and our advisors also\nconsidered that the draft merger agreement submitted by Blackstone did not entitle the Company to\nspecifically enforce the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter, and that the Company\u2019s exclusive\nremedy would be limited to a $200 million reverse termination fee payable by Parent in certain circumstances\n(the payment of which would be guaranteed by Blackstone Real Estate Partners IX L.P.), as well as\nBlackstone\u2019s track record of completing REIT acquisitions. The directors, management and the advisors\ncompared Blackstone\u2019s proposal to Party C\u2019s lower per-share offer, and also considered the uncertainties in\nthe financing plan proposed by Party C, as well as its proposal for an outside date of six months from the\ndate of the merger agreement, which the board of directors believed increased the risk of not closing. The\nboard of directors also considered the number of potential transaction counterparties that expressed an\ninterest in a transaction involving our multi-family residential real estate\n39 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nportfolio and participated in the transaction process, but that only Blackstone indicated it would be able to\nacquire the Company on terms that would be acceptable to the Company. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton\nreviewed the structure of the proposed transaction and the steps to be taken to consummate the separation\nand the distribution, including the operating partnership\u2019s distribution of its interests in the New LP holding\nour multi-family residential real estate business to the Company as consideration for a redemption of the\nRedeemed Units in the Exchange, followed by a contribution of the Company\u2019s remaining interest in the\noperating partnership to Bluerock Homes prior to the distribution. The directors, management and our\nadvisors also discussed the treatment of management and their interests in the proposed transaction,\nincluding the Exchange, which will result in an increase in the ownership of the Bluerock Homes Business by\nholders of operating partnership interests (other than Bluerock Homes), and management\u2019s commitment to\nour single-family residential real estate business through their commitments not to redeem their operating\npartnership interests, as well as management\u2019s ownership of the Manager proposed to enter into the\nManagement Agreement with Bluerock Homes. The board of directors then received a presentation from Duff\n& Phelps regarding the proposed terms of the Exchange and a presentation from Stanger regarding the\nproposed terms of the Management Agreement between Bluerock Homes and its Manager. After deliberation,\nthe board of directors determined that Blackstone was the potential acquirer that was likely to offer the\ngreatest value and the greatest certainty of closing and that the Company should pursue the potential\ntransaction with Blackstone but continue to improve the terms of the merger agreement and other transaction\ndocuments.\nOver the course of the following days, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Simpson Thacher negotiated\nthe remaining unresolved terms in the merger agreement and other transaction documents.\nOn December 18, 2021, Party C submitted a revised proposal, increasing its proposed purchase price to\n$23.00 in cash per share of Common Stock. Party C did not offer any extension to the six-month outside date\ncontemplated by its revised draft of the merger agreement submitted on December 14, 2021. Party C also\nexplained that it would require until the end of December 2021 in order to be in a position to enter into a\nmerger agreement and announce a transaction.\nOn the afternoon of December 19, 2021, the board of directors held a special meeting during which\nmanagement and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Wachtell Lipton reviewed the history of the\ntransaction process, negotiations with Blackstone and Party C and the terms of Blackstone\u2019s proposal.\nRepresentatives of Eastdil, Bank of America, KVCF and Duff & Phelps were also in attendance.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley provided an updated financial presentation regarding the final proposal\nfrom Blackstone and a valuation analysis of the Company and then delivered to the board of directors\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of the date of such opinion and\nsubject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and\nlimitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the\nConsideration to be received by the holders of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the merger agreement is\nfair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Common Stock. Prior to the meeting, the\ndirectors were provided with a relationship disclosure letter from Morgan Stanley, Eastdil, Bank of America,\nDuff & Phelps and Stanger, and, at the meeting, representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the\ndirectors the relationship disclosure letters. The directors also received, prior to the meeting, the Duff &\nPhelps Opinion and the Stanger Opinion. At the meeting, representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with\nthe directors their duties in connection with their consideration and potential approval of the transaction\nwith Blackstone. Following discussion, the board of directors unanimously determined and declared the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, to be advisable and in the best\ninterests of the Company and our stockholders and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the\nmerger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and resolved to\nrecommend that the holders of Common Stock approve the merger. In addition, the board of directors and\nmanagement discussed our communications plan with respect to the proposed transaction with Blackstone\nand reviewed a draft press release to be issued in connection with the transaction.\nThe parties finalized and executed the merger agreement and the other transaction documents early in the\nmorning of December 20, 2021. Thereafter, later in the morning of December 20, 2021, the parties issued a\npress release announcing the transaction.\n40 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b",

best interests of the Company and our stockholders and to\napprove the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to recommend that the holders of Common Stock approve\nthe merger, the board of directors consulted with our senior management team, as well as our financial and\nlegal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors which the board\nof directors viewed as supporting its decision:\nthe current and historical trading prices of shares of Common Stock, and the fact that the merger\nconsideration of $24.25 per share in cash (without taking into account the value of the shares of\nBluerock Homes to be received by holders of Common Stock in the distribution) represents a premium\nof approximately 124% to the unaffected closing price of $10.85 on September 15, 2021, the last day\nprior to the September 16 Bloomberg article reporting that the Company was considering strategic\nalternatives\u037e\nthe course and history of competitive negotiations between the Company and the potential\ntransaction counterparties, including Party C and Blackstone, and the belief of the board of directors\nthat it had obtained Blackstone\u2019s best and final offer and that it was unlikely that any other party\nwould be willing to transact at a higher valuation\u037e\nthe fact that Party C\u2019s highest bid was $23.00 per share and that Party C\u2019s proposal provided for a six\nmonth outside date\u037e\nthe process conducted by the Company, including the fact that the Company or our advisors\ncontacted or were contacted by 55 potential transaction counterparties, including following the\nSeptember 16 Bloomberg article reporting that the Company was evaluating strategic alternatives, and\nthat a total of 28 parties executed non-disclosure agreements with the Company in order to conduct\ndue diligence\u037e\nthe fact that no potential transaction counterparty that submitted an initial indication of interest\n(other than Party A in its initial unsolicited proposal prior to Party A\u2019s participation in the process),\nexpressed any interest in any of our assets other than the multi-family residential real estate portfolio\u037e\nthe fact that all potential transaction counterparties that submitted initial indications of interests,\nother than the four highest bidders, whose proposals exceeded $3.2 billion in gross asset value and\nwho advanced to the final round of diligence and proposals, were advised by representatives of\nMorgan Stanley and Eastdil, on behalf of the Company, that they would have to increase the value of\ntheir proposals in order to participate in the next round of bidding, and that no such parties increased\nthe value of their proposals\u037e\nthe fact that, in late November 2021, each of Party B and Party D indicated that it was uncertain about\nits ability to make a best and final proposal prior to the December 15, 2021 deadline for the submission\nof proposals, or even with a greater amount of time, and the fact that, while Party B and D were\nadvised by representatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil, on behalf of the Company, that, although\nthe Company did not intend to delay the deadline, each such party should continue to perform due\ndiligence, both Party B and Party D subsequently ceased their due diligence activity in the virtual\ndata room and did not thereafter contact the Company or our advisors with respect to a

the prospects of Bluerock Homes on a\nstandalone basis, that the combined value of the merger consideration and the shares of Bluerock\nHomes common stock that stockholders will receive in the

The Company did\nnot provide bidders with financial information contemplated by the \u201cfull deployment\u201d assumptions\nunderlying the Bluerock Homes projections, as discussed above, or with respect to the reinvestment of\nproceeds received from maturing mezzanine and preferred investments in the multi-family residential real\nestate portfolio nor with respect to certain mezzanine or preferred investments that were not expected to be\nheld by the Company at the time of the merger.\nThe Company also provided financial projections to the board of directors and to Stanger in connection with\nits fairness opinion that included $0 in incentive fees payable to the Manager under the Management\nAgreement under three scenarios assuming capital raises of $1 billion, $1.25 billion and $1.5 billion.\nCertain of the above financial projections above were not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including NOI,\nMezzanine / Preferred Cash Flows, EBITDA, G&A, Capex, Funding Commitments, NAV, FFO, Net Debt, Total\nDebt, GAV, interest income and incentive fees. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our\nfinancial results and believe that they enhance investors\u2019 understanding of our financial performance and the\ncomparability of our results to prior periods, as well as against the performance of REITs. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ\nfrom others in the industry and are not necessarily comparable with similarly titled amounts used by other\ncompanies. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the financial projections were relied upon by Morgan\nStanley for purposes of its fairness opinion and by the board of directors in connection with its\nconsideration of the merger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the\ndefinition of non-GAAP financial measures and therefore are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures\nof non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon\nby Morgan Stanley for purposes of its fairness opinion or by the board of directors in connection with its\nconsideration of the merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures\nincluded in the financial projections above.\nWe do not intend to update or otherwise revise the above financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after\nthe date when they were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the\nassumptions underlying such unaudited prospective financial information are no longer appropriate.\n47",

The following summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses performed\nand factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses\ndescribed represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of\nfinancial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial\nanalyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each\n49 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsummary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses\nlisted in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion of such\nanalyses and of the factors reviewed, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading\nor incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion. Furthermore, mathematical analysis\n(such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to\nbelow.\nFor purposes of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the analyses described below, the consideration to be\nreceived by holders of shares of our Common Stock in connection with the Transactions was assumed to be\n$24.25 per share in cash, together with shares of Bluerock Homes common stock to be received by holders of\nshares of our Common Stock in the distribution pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.\nComparable Public Companies Analysis\nMorgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain publicly available financial information, publicly available\nratios and publicly available market multiples relating to the Company with equivalent publicly available data\nfor companies that share similar business characteristics with the Company to derive an implied equity value\nreference range for the Company. Morgan Stanley reviewed the following publicly traded companies (which\nare referred to as \u201cselected companies\u201d in this section): Preferred Apartment Communities Inc., BRT\nApartments Corp., Centerspace, Independence Realty Trust Inc. and NexPoint Residential Trust Inc.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed certain statistics for each of these companies for\ncomparison purposes, including the ratios of share price to consensus Wall Street research analyst (\u201cStreet\nconsensus\u201d) estimated funds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) for calendar years 2022 and 2023 and share price to\nStreet consensus estimated adjusted funds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) for calendar years 2022 and 2023.\nMorgan Stanley also analyzed for each of these companies the premium or discount represented by the ratio\nof share price to Street consensus estimated NAV per share, the premium or discount represented by the\nratio of share price to Street consensus estimated GAV per share and the capitalization rate implied by each\nof these companies\u2019 share prices. The multiples, ratio and implied capitalization rate for each of the selected\ncompanies were calculated using their respective closing prices on December 17, 2021, and were based on\nthe most recent publicly available information, Capital IQ consensus estimates and SNL Financial consensus\nestimates as of December 17, 2021, which represents the last closing price for our Common Stock and the\nselected companies\u2019 stock prior to the announcement of the Transactions. Morgan Stanley derived a range\nfor each metric using the mean value for each statistic for the applicable comparable companies as a midpoint\nand setting a range using (a) 2.0x above and below that midpoint for share price to 2022 and 2023 estimated\nFFO and share price to 2022 and 2023 estimated AFFO, (b) 2.5% above and below the midpoint for the\npremium or discount of share price to Street consensus estimated NAV per share and GAV per share and (c)\n0.25% above and below the midpoint for the implied capitalization rate. Morgan Stanley selected these\nranges based on its professional judgment after reviewing the selected companies\u2019 ranges for each metric\nand the historical ranges of the Company for each metric.\nMorgan Stanley then used these multiple and percentage ranges to derive separate implied per share equity\nvalue reference ranges for the Company using each of the metrics reviewed by applying the range derived\nfrom the comparable companies for each metric to the corresponding Street consensus metrics for the\nCompany. The following table reflects the results of this analysis:\nRange\nImplied Per\nShare \nEquity Value\nRange\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nPrice / 2022E FFO\n19.0\n23.0\n$15.17\n$18.37\nPrice / 2023E FFO\n16.5\n20.5\n$15.42\n$19.16\nPrice / 2022E AFFO\n20.8\n24.8\n$15.13\n$18.03\nPrice / 2023E AFFO\n17.7\n21.7\n$14.64\n$17.94\nPremium / Discount to the mean Street consensus estimated NAV\n(5\n1\n$15.58\n$16.39\nPremium / Discount to the mean Street estimated GAV\n(5\n1\n$12.61\n$16.18\nImplied Capitalization Rate\n5.3\n4.8\n$11.21\n$17.03\n50 \nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n)%\n%\n)%\n%\n%\n%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following implied per share equity value reference range\nfor the Company based on the average of the low and high end of the selected range determined by taking\nthe average of the respective low and high FFO, AFFO and NAV metrics above, in each case, using levered\nvalue, and the respective GAV and Implied Capitalization Rate metrics above, in each case, using unlevered\nvalue. This analysis indicated the following implied per share equity value reference range for a share of our\nCommon Stock, as compared to the Consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nPer Share Consideration\n$13.55 to $17.29\n$24.25 and shares of Bluerock Homes common stock to\nbe \nreceived in the distribution\nNo company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating\ncomparable companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry\nperformance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are\nbeyond the Company\u2019s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company and the industry\ngenerally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and\nprospects of the Company or the industry, or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such\nas determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company\ndata.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley calculated a range of implied equity value per share of our Common Stock, based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis utilizing the financial projections provided by our management, which\nfinancial projections are described in the section entitled \u201c- Forward-Looking Financial Information.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company\nby calculating the present value of estimated future unlevered free cash flows, terminal value and in the\nCompany\u2019s mezzanine and preferred investments. The \u201cunlevered free cash flows\u201d or \u201cfree cash flows\u201d refer\nto a calculation of the future cash flows of an asset without including, in such calculation, any debt-\nservicing costs. The present value of a terminal value, representing the value of unlevered free cash flows\nbeyond the end of the forecast period (excluding unlevered free cash flows from mezzanine and preferred\ninvestments), and the present value of the Company\u2019s mezzanine and preferred investments, are added to\narrive at a total aggregate value. Outstanding debt, the liquidation value of preferred equity and\nnoncontrolling interests are subtracted and the Company\u2019s cash on hand as of September 30, 2021 is added\nto arrive at an equity value. The calculated equity value is then divided by the number of fully diluted shares\nof our Common Stock, in order to arrive at an implied equity value per share.\nThe projected unlevered free cash flows from September 30, 2022 through the end of 2026 were discounted to\npresent value using a range of discount rates from 5.4% to 5.8% representing the Company\u2019s weighted\naverage cost of capital, which weighted average cost of capital was calculated by Morgan Stanley based on\ninformation provided to it by the Company. The weighted average cost of capital was determined utilizing the\ncapital asset pricing model to calculate the Company\u2019s cost of equity and utilizing the Company\u2019s current\nweighted average interest rate on its current indebtedness to calculate the Company\u2019s cost of debt.\nMorgan Stanley then calculated a range of implied terminal enterprise values of the Company as of\nSeptember 30, 2026, by applying a range of implied exit capitalization rates of 5.0% to 5.5% to the forecasted\nNOI of the Company for the 12 months ending September 30, 2027. The range of capitalization rates was\nselected using the Company\u2019s implied capitalization rate as of December 17, 2021 and the Company\u2019s five-\nyear historical average implied capitalization rate as of December 17, 2021 as the low end and the high end,\nrespectively. The implied terminal enterprise value of the Company was then discounted to present value\nusing the range of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital as the discount rates. This present value\nof the implied terminal enterprise value of the Company was then added to the implied present value of the\nunlevered free cash flows as described above and the implied present value of the Company\u2019s mezzanine and\npreferred investments, subtracting outstanding debt, the liquidation value of preferred equity and\nnoncontrolling interests and adding the Company\u2019s cash on hand as of September 30, 2021, and dividing by\nthe number of fully diluted shares of Common Stock as of September 30, 2021 (accounting for dilution by\nCompany Warrants outstanding as of December 14, 2021), all as provided by the Company\u2019s management.\n51 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThis analysis implied the following range for our Common Stock, as compared to the Consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nPer Share Consideration\n$13.48 to $19.96\n$24.25 and share(s) of Bluerock Homes common stock to\nbe \nreceived in the distribution\nNet Asset Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley analyzed the value of the Company as a function of the net value of its assets. Morgan\nStanley based its net asset value analysis on our management\u2019s estimates of asset value as of September 30,\n2021. Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated net asset value per share of our Common Stock by applying\nto management\u2019s estimated forward NOI of $131 million a range of capitalization rates of 3.6% to 5.8%, which\nrange was selected based on, among other factors, market-specific capitalization rates per Green Street.\nMorgan Stanley added the estimated value of the Company\u2019s preferred and mezzanine portfolio, cash,\nrestricted cash, amounts due from affiliates and accounts receivable, prepaids and other, and deducted\nproperty-level debt, accounts payable, other accrued liabilities, amounts due to affiliates, distributions\npayable, joint venture partner interests and promotes payable and the liquidation value of preferred equity\nfrom the aggregate value of the Company\u2019s assets. Additionally, Morgan Stanley deducted the estimated\ncosts required to consummate the Transactions and prepay property-level debt of the Company as provided\nby management. An implied per share equity value reference range for the Company was then calculated\nbased on the range of our net asset values derived from such analysis divided by the number of fully diluted\nshares of Common Stock outstanding as of September 30, 2021 (accounting for dilution by Company\nWarrants outstanding as of December 14, 2021). This analysis indicated the following implied per share\nequity value reference range for each share of our Common Stock, net of estimated transaction costs, as\ncompared to the Consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nPer Share Consideration\n$17.57 to $26.18\n$24.25 and share(s) of Bluerock Homes common stock to\nbe \nreceived in the distribution\nPremiums Paid Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of selected public company\nprecedent transactions announced since 2000, in which the targets were publicly traded U.S. multi-family\nREITs and the transaction value was at least $100 million (excluding student housing and merger-of-equals\ntransactions). All transactions that Morgan Stanley found that satisfied the foregoing criteria were included\nin the premiums paid analysis.\nSelected Precedent Transactions\nTransaction Announcement Date\nTarget\nAcquiror\nJuly 2019\nPure Multi-Family REIT\nCortland Partners\nJuly 2017\nMonogram Residential Trust\nGreystar-led consortium\nJanuary 2017\nMilestone Apartments\nStarwood Capital Group\nAugust 2016\nPost Properties\nMid-America Apartment\nCommunities\nJune 2015\nHome Properties\nLone Star Americas Acquisitions\nMay 2015\nTrade Street Residential\nIndependence Realty Trust\nApril 2015\nAssociated Estates Realty Corp.\nBrookfield Property Group\nDecember 2013\nBRE Properties\nEssex Property Trust\nJune 2013\nColonial Properties Trust\nMid-America Apartment\nCommunities\nJune 2007\nAmerica First Apartment\nInvestors\nSentinel Omaha LLC\n52 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTransaction Announcement Date\nTarget\nAcquiror\nMay 2007\nArchstone Smith Trust\nTishman Speyer & Lehman\nBrothers\nDecember 2005\nTown & Country Trust\nMorgan Stanley / Onex Real\nEstate JV\nOctober 2005\nAmli Residential Properties\nPrime Property Fund\nJune 2005\nGables Residential Trust\nING Clarion\nOctober 2004\nCornerstone Realty Income Trust\nColonial Properties Trust\nOctober 2004\nSummit Properties\nCamden Property Trust\nMay 2001\nCharles E.

Morgan Stanley noted that the mean of the premiums paid in these precedent\ntransactions was 13.8%.\nBased on the results of this analysis and the premiums paid in precedent transactions as outlined above,\nMorgan Stanley applied a premium range of 9.0% to 17.2% based on the observed bottom quartile and top\nquartile, respectively, to the last unaffected price for our Common Stock of $10.85 on September 15, 2021,\nwhich resulted in the following implied Common Stock equity value range of the Company, as compared to\nthe Consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nPer Share Consideration\n$11.82 to $12.72\n$24.25 and share(s) of Bluerock Homes common stock to\nbe \nreceived in the distribution\nNo company or transaction utilized in the premiums paid analysis is identical to the Company or the\nTransactions. The fact that points in the range of implied value per share of the Company derived from the\nvaluation of premiums paid in precedent transactions were less than or greater than the Consideration is not\nnecessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis of the Consideration, but is one of\nmany factors Morgan Stanley considered.\nHistorical Stock Price\nMorgan Stanley reviewed our stock price performance during the 52 weeks ending December 17, 2021, and\nthe volume-weighted average stock price during the 30-trading-day and 90-trading-day periods ending\nSeptember 15, 2021, the last unaffected trading date for our Common Stock. Based on this review, Morgan\nStanley noted our Common Stock had traded in the following ranges over the applicable 52-week period\nending December 17, 2021, and the 30-day and 90-day periods ending September 15, 2021, as compared to the\nConsideration:\n52 Weeks Ending \nDecember 17, 2021\n30-day Period\nEnding \nSeptember 15,\n2021\n90-day Period\nEnding \nSeptember 15,\n2021\nPer Share \nConsideration\n$8.80 to $16.62\n$\n11.60\n$\n10.47\n$24.25 and share(s)\nof \nBluerock Homes \ncommon stock to \nbe received in the \ndistribution\n53 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPrivate Buyer Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a hypothetical take-private analysis to determine the prices at which a financial\nsponsor might effect a leveraged buyout of the Company under current market conditions. In preparing this\nanalysis, Morgan Stanley utilized the financial projections provided by our management, including estimated\nNOI for the years ending September 30, 2022 through September 30, 2026. Morgan Stanley based its analysis\non the financial projections provided by our management and assumed a September 30, 2026 exit at a range\nof market capitalization rates of 3.9% to 4.4%. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that (i) the acquisition\noccurred on September 30, 2021, based on our September 30, 2021 financial statements, (ii) a five-year hold\nperiod, (iii) the potential impact of any property tax resets was disregarded, (iv) the buyer incurs new CMBS\ndebt in connection with the transaction in an aggregate principal amount resulting in a loan-to-value ratio of\n60%, and (v) the buyer is targeting a levered internal rate of return of 10% to 12%. Based upon these\nassumptions, Morgan Stanley calculated the following implied per share equity value reference range for our\nCommon Stock, as compared to the Consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nPer Share Consideration\n$15.01 to $28.25\n$24.25 and share(s) of Bluerock Homes common stock to\nbe \nreceived in the distribution\nResearch Analyst Price Targets and NAV Targets\nMorgan Stanley reviewed available public market trading price targets for our Common Stock by all four\nequity research analysts that provided a price target for the Company prior to November 16, 2021, the date of\nthe most recent report available at the time of such analysis. Morgan Stanley reviewed the most recent price\ntarget published by each of the analysts prior to such date. These targets reflect each analyst\u2019s estimate of\nthe future public market trading price of our Common Stock at the time the price target was published. Based\non this review, Morgan Stanley noted that the equity research analysts had the following range of price\ntargets per share of our Common Stock, as compared to the Consideration:\nResearch Analyst Price Targets\nPer Share Consideration\n$11.50 to $14.50\n$24.25 and share(s) of Bluerock Homes common stock to\nbe \nreceived in the distribution\nMorgan Stanley also reviewed available equity research analyst estimates of NAV per share of our Common\nStock prior to November 16, 2021. Morgan Stanley reviewed the most recent estimates of NAV per share\npublished by five equity research analysts, including four of the same analysts who published price targets\nprior to such date. Based on this review, Morgan Stanley noted that the equity research analysts had the\nfollowing range of estimates of NAV per share of our Common Stock of the Company, as compared to the\nConsideration:\nResearch Analyst NAV Per Share Estimates\nPer Share Consideration\n$12.07 to $20.50\n$24.25 and share(s) of Bluerock Homes common stock to\nbe \nreceived in the distribution\nThe public market trading price targets and estimates of NAV per share published by equity research\nanalysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for our Common Stock, and these targets\nand estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of the Company and\nfuture financial market conditions. Moreover, the NAV per share estimates published by equity research\nanalysts typically do not account for the costs required to execute a merger. Such costs include transfer\ntaxes, debt breakage costs, compensation costs trigged by a change of control, professional and advisory\nfees, and other miscellaneous costs.\nBluerock Homes Common Stock\nMorgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain publicly available financial information, publicly available\nratios and publicly available market multiples regarding publicly traded U.S. single-family REITs and publicly\ntraded externally managed REITs, which companies shared certain business characteristics with\n54 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBluerock Homes, including Bluerock Homes\u2019 expected leverage, structure and geographical profile. Morgan\nStanley then applied the 2022 consensus EBITDA multiple, 2022 consensus FFO multiple and Premium/\u200b\nDiscount to the mean consensus estimated NAV, in each case, of certain of these comparable companies to\nour management\u2019s financial projections and estimates with respect to Bluerock Homes\u2019s NAV, EBITDA and\nFFO, each as described in the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Financial Information,\u201d in order to derive a\nreference range of implied trading value of Bluerock Homes per share of Bluerock Residential Common Stock\nof $3.45 to $5.98 per share of Bluerock Residential Common Stock, as compared to the $5.60 NAV of Bluerock\nHomes per share of Bluerock Residential Common Stock, based on management\u2019s estimate of Bluerock\nHomes\u2019 NAV of $494 million.\nGeneral\nMorgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its\nopinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a\npartial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of\nall of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it\nconsidered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of these analyses, without considering all\nanalyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In\naddition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other\nanalyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other\nassumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above\nshould not be taken to be Morgan Stanley\u2019s view of the actual value of the Company.\nIn performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters.\nThese include, among other things, the impact of competition on the businesses of the Company and the\nindustry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial\ncondition and prospects of the Company, or the industry, or in the financial markets in general. Many of\nthese assumptions are beyond the control of the Company. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nanalyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or\nless favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view of the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of our Common Stock\npursuant to the merger agreement, and in connection with the delivery of its opinion as of December 19,\n2021, to our board of directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at\nwhich shares of our Common Stock might actually trade.\nThe Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and\nwas unanimously approved by our board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Company\nwas unanimously approved by our board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Company\nduring these negotiations. Morgan Stanley did not, however, recommend any specific form or amount of\nconsideration to us or our board of directors, or that any specific consideration constituted the only\nappropriate consideration for the Transactions. Morgan Stanley was not requested to opine as to, and its\nopinion does not in any manner address, the underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with\nor effect the Transactions or the likelihood of consummation of the Transactions, nor does it address the\nrelative merits of the Transactions as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other\nalternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion was not intended to, and does not, express an opinion or a recommendation as to how any holder of\nshares of our Common Stock should vote at the special meeting to be held in connection with the merger, or\nas to any other action that a holder of shares of our Common Stock should take relating to the Transactions.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and presentation to our board of directors was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by our board of directors in deciding to determine and declare that the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the\nCompany and its stockholders (see \u201c- Reasons for the Merger\u201d and \u201c- Recommendation of Our Board of\nDirectors\u201d). Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the\n55 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nopinion of our board of directors with respect to the Consideration or of whether our board of directors\nwould have been willing to agree to a different consideration.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other\nprofessionals in accordance with its customary practice. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm\nengaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses.

In\naddition, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may have committed and may commit in the\nfuture to invest in private equity funds managed by affiliates of Parent.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided our board of directors with financial\nadvisory services and a financial opinion, and we have agreed to pay Morgan Stanley an aggregate fee equal\nto approximately $29 million, a portion of which is payable quarterly during the term of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nengagement, a portion of which was contingent upon rendering of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial opinion and a\nportion of which is contingent upon the closing of the merger. We have also agreed to reimburse Morgan\nStanley for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional\nadvisors, incurred in performing its services.

Morgan Stanley has provided financial advisory and financing services to Parent and its affiliates\n(including certain majority-controlled affiliates and portfolio companies of Parent identified by Morgan\nStanley and disclosed to us) and, in the two years prior to December 17, 2021, received fees of approximately\n$250 million to $300 million in connection with such services.

Duff & Phelps also took into account its assessment of\ngeneral economic, market and financial conditions, as well as its experience in real estate and business\nvaluations, in general, and with respect to similar transactions, in particular.

Duff & Phelps noted that the analyses have been designed\nspecifically for the opinion and may not translate to any other purposes. The preparation of a fairness\nopinion is a complex analytical process, and therefore is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or\nsummary description. While this summary describes the analyses and factors that Duff & Phelps deemed\nmaterial in its presentations to the board of directors and its opinion, it does not purport to be a\ncomprehensive description of all analyses and factors considered by Duff & Phelps. The opinion is based on\nthe comprehensive consideration of the various analyses performed. This summary is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the full text of the opinion attached as Exhibit C to this proxy statement.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Duff & Phelps did not attribute any particular weight to any particular analysis or\nfactor considered by it and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or\nfactor for purposes of its opinion, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance\nof each analysis and factor. Several analytical methodologies were employed by Duff & Phelps in its\nanalyses, and no one single method of analysis should be regarded as critical to the overall conclusion\nreached by Duff & Phelps. Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature\nof the available information may further affect the value of particular techniques. Accordingly, Duff & Phelps\nbelieves that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of\nthe factors considered by Duff & Phelps, without considering all analyses and factors in their entirety, could\ncreate a misleading or incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying the opinion. The conclusion\nreached by Duff & Phelps, therefore, is based on the application of Duff & Phelps\u2019s own experience and\njudgment to all analyses and factors considered by Duff & Phelps, taken as a whole.\nDuff & Phelps used various financial analyses (described in detail below) to estimate the value of the\nBluerock Homes Business\u2019s interests in properties within its portfolio. Duff & Phelps applied different\nfinancial analyses to valuing different properties based on a number of factors unique to each property,\nincluding, among other factors, the type of interest that the Bluerock Homes Business had in such property\nand the recency of the investment in such property.\nDuff & Phelps combined the valuation results from these financial analyses to determine a range of value for\nthe Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s interests in the properties within its portfolio. Duff & Phelps then added the\nBluerock Homes Business\u2019s estimated cash and cash equivalents of $168.0 million (which is also the target\ncash amount for Bluerock Homes set forth in the separation principles, and was provided to Duff & Phelps\nby Company management) to the aggregate value of those interests. The result was a net asset value range\nfor the Bluerock Homes Business of $483.3 million to $504.1 million. Duff & Phelps noted that the value of the\nBluerock Homes Business of $498.7 million implied by the exchange consideration fell within the range of the\nresulting valuations.\nDirect Capitalization Analysis for Stabilized Properties\nDuff & Phelps employed the direct capitalization approach to estimate the value of certain stabilized\nproperties in the Bluerock Homes Business portfolio in which the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s interest is\ncommon equity ownership. These properties were not included in the analysis described in the sections\nbelow entitled \u201cLiquidation Valuation\u201d or \u201cLetter of Intent and Broker Price Opinion Valuation Analyses for\nMiscellaneous Properties.\u201d For this purpose, a stabilized property refers to a property that was identified as\na stabilized property by Company management, generally where construction or renovation of the property\nhad been completed and the property had achieved or nearly achieved a high occupancy rate. Under the\ndirect capitalization approach, the stabilized NOI for each such property is determined, and then a direct\ncapitalization analysis is used to determine the gross asset value of the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s interest\nin these portfolio properties by applying a capitalization rate to the stabilized NOI.\n58 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor purposes of the analysis performed by Duff & Phelps, the stabilized NOI for each such property was\nselected by Duff & Phelps in its professional judgment based upon recent third-party appraisals and third-\nparty broker price opinions, as applicable, for each property. A range of appropriate capitalization rates was\ndetermined using Duff & Phelps\u2019s professional judgment based upon qualitative property characteristics,\ncompetitive position and market conditions, industry surveys, other comparable single-family residential\ntransactions, single-family portfolio transactions and an analysis of publicly traded REITs that Duff &\nPhelps deemed relevant. The high and low capitalization rates for each property were then applied to the\nproperty\u2019s stabilized NOI, and the resulting range of capitalized NOI was used to calculate a high and low\ngross asset value of each such property. All debt and preferred equity interests were valued at face value.\nThe face value of any debt and preferred interests in a property were deducted from these gross asset\nvalues. The resulting figure was multiplied by the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s percentage of common equity\ninterest in each property to derive a valuation range of the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s common equity\ninterest in each such property.\nLiquidation Valuation\nDuff & Phelps employed a liquidation valuation to estimate the value of investments in the properties in the\nBluerock Homes Business portfolio in which the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s investments consist of only\ndebt or preferred equity. Duff & Phelps also used the liquidation valuation for the properties in the Bluerock\nHomes Business in which the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s investments consists of debt or preferred equity\nand common equity ownership and the properties were recently acquired or no NOI was provided by or\nascertainable from information provided by Company management. For these properties, the Bluerock Homes\nBusiness\u2019s investments in the properties were valued at the face value of the investments made by the\nBluerock Homes Business to the date of the valuation. As these valuations were equal to the cost of the\ninvestment by the Bluerock Homes Business, this analysis yielded a single net asset value, with no range.\nDCF analyses were utilized to confirm that the values of investments in certain properties were not impaired,\nin order to support using liquidation values for these properties.\nLetter of Intent and Broker Price Opinion Valuation Analyses for Miscellaneous Properties\nFor one property for which a letter of intent for a disposition of that property by the Bluerock Homes\nBusiness had been entered into prior to the valuation date, and which was provided by Company\nmanagement to Duff & Phelps, the estimated year-end closing sale price of $141 million set forth in the letter\nof intent was used to calculate the value of the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s preferred interest in that\nproperty. From the $141 million purchase price, all debt and preferred interests not held by the Bluerock\nHomes Business were deducted. As the resulting value was greater than the face value of preferred interests\nheld by the Bluerock Homes Business, and thus that preferred interest would not be impaired in the sale, the\nvalue of the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s preferred interest in the property was valued at the face value of the\npreferred investment made by the Bluerock Homes Business.\nA third-party broker price opinion was used to value the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s common equity interest\nin one other property. The value of the common equity interest based on the broker price opinion was then\nadded to the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s debt and preferred interests in that property to derive a valuation\nfor the Bluerock Homes Business\u2019s investments in that property.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses by Duff & Phelps\nBased on the valuation indications derived from its valuation analyses, Duff & Phelps determined a value\nrange for the net asset value of the Bluerock Homes Business of $483.3 million to $504.1 million. Duff &\nPhelps noted that the value of the Bluerock Homes Business of $498.7 million implied by the exchange\nconsideration fell within the range of the resulting net asset values. As a result, subject to the assumptions,\nqualifications, and limitations set forth in the Duff & Phelps Opinion, Duff & Phelps determined that the\nexchange consideration to be paid by the Company in the Exchange is fair, from a financial point of view, to\nthe Company.\n59 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAssumptions, Qualifications and Limiting Conditions\nIn performing its analyses, rendering its opinion with respect to the exchange consideration, Duff & Phelps,\nwith the Company\u2019s consent:\nRelied upon the accuracy, completeness, and fair presentation of all information, data, advice,\nopinions and representations obtained from public sources or provided to it from private sources,\nincluding Company management, and did not independently verify such information\u037e\nRelied upon the fact that the board of directors and the Company are advised by counsel as to all\nlegal matters with respect to the Exchange and the other aspects of the Exchange and the\nTransactions\u037e\nAssumed that any estimates, evaluations, forecasts and projections furnished to Duff & Phelps were\nreasonably prepared and based upon the best currently available information and good-faith\njudgment of the person furnishing the same, and Duff & Phelps expressed no opinion with respect to\nsuch projections or the underlying assumptions\u037e\nAssumed that information supplied and representations made by Company management were\nsubstantially accurate regarding the Bluerock Homes Business and the Exchange\u037e\nAssumed that the merger will be consummated at the price set forth in the merger agreement and that\nsuch price represents a fair value for the Company after giving effect to the Company\u2019s contribution\nof its remaining interest in the operating partnership (including the general partnership interest) after\ngiving effect to the Exchange to Bluerock Homes and distribution of its ownership interest in\nBluerock Homes to the holders of Common Stock (the \u201ccontribution and distribution\u201d)\u037e\nAssumed that the final versions of all documents reviewed by Duff & Phelps in draft form conformed\nin all material respects to the drafts reviewed\u037e\nAssumed that there was no material change in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of\noperations, business, or prospects of the Company since the date of the most recent financial\nstatements and other information made available to Duff & Phelps, and that there was no information\nor facts that would make the information reviewed by Duff & Phelps incomplete or misleading\u037e\nAssumed that the Exchange would be completed in accordance with the transaction documents\nwithout any amendments thereto or any waivers of any terms or conditions thereof\u037e and\nAssumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the\nconsummation of the Exchange would be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or the\nBluerock Homes Business.\nThe foregoing assumptions or any of the material facts on which the opinion was based may prove to be\nuntrue. Furthermore, in Duff & Phelps\u2019s analysis and in connection with the preparation of its opinion, Duff\n& Phelps made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, market and\neconomic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of any party involved in the\nExchange.\nDuff & Phelps prepared its opinion effective as of December 19, 2021. The opinion is necessarily based upon\nmarket, economic, financial and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of the\nopinion, and Duff & Phelps disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in\nany fact or matter affecting its opinion which may come or be brought to the attention of Duff & Phelps after\nthe date thereof. Duff & Phelps expressed no view as to the potential effects of any unusual volatility in the\ncredit, financial and stock markets on the Company or the Exchange.\nDuff & Phelps did not evaluate the Company\u2019s solvency or conduct an independent appraisal or physical\ninspection of any specific assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise). Duff & Phelps was not requested,\nand did not advise the board of directors or any other party with respect to alternatives, to the Exchange.\nDuff & Phelps did not express any opinion as to the market price or value of the Company\u2019s common stock\n(or anything else) after the announcement or the consummation of the Transactions. The opinion should not\nbe construed as a valuation opinion, credit rating, solvency opinion, an analysis of the Company\u2019s\n60 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncreditworthiness, as tax advice, or as accounting advice. Duff & Phelps did not make, and assumes no\nresponsibility to make, any representation, or render any opinion, as to any legal matter.\nIn rendering its opinion, Duff & Phelps did not express any opinion with respect to the amount or nature of\nany compensation to any of the Company\u2019s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons,\nrelative to the consideration to be received by the public shareholders of the Company in the Transactions,\nor with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nFees and Expenses, Prior Relationships\nUnder the terms of the Company\u2019s engagement letter with Duff & Phelps, we have agreed to pay Duff &\nPhelps an aggregate fee of $600,000, $250,000 of which was paid upon its engagement, $250,000 of which was\npaid upon Duff & Phelps informing the Company that it was prepared to deliver the opinion (regardless of\nthe conclusion reached in the opinion), and $100,000 of which was paid upon the public announcement of\nthe Transactions. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Duff & Phelps for its out-of-pocket\nexpenses and to indemnify Duff & Phelps and certain related persons against liabilities arising out of Duff &\nPhelps\u2019s service as a financial advisor to the board of directors. The terms of the fee arrangement with Duff\n& Phelps, which the Company and Duff & Phelps believe are customary in transactions of this nature, were\nnegotiated at arm\u2019s length between the Company and Duff & Phelps, and the board of directors is aware of\nthe Transactions. No portion of Duff & Phelps\u2019s fee was contingent on either the conclusions reached in its\nopinion or the consummation of the Exchange and the Transactions or any other transaction.\nDuring the two years preceding the date of the opinion, Duff & Phelps has provided certain valuation\nservices to the Company for which it received fees that are immaterial to Duff & Phelps, and it is the intent of\nthe Company to engage Duff & Phelps for certain opinion services related to the contribution and\ndistribution (the fees of which are expected to be immaterial to Duff & Phelps). Additionally, Duff & Phelps\nhas in the past provided, and continues to provide, affiliates of Parent with periodic portfolio valuation\nservices. Furthermore, Duff & Phelps has previously been and is currently engaged to provide financial\nadvisory services to affiliates of Parent in connection with related party transactions and valuation advisory\nservices for certain of the portfolio companies of affiliates of Parent. For these prior and future engagements,\nDuff & Phelps received, and will receive, customary fees (which have been and are expected to be immaterial\nto Duff & Phelps), expense reimbursement, and indemnification. For the avoidance of any doubt, Duff &\nPhelps is not engaged to provide any services to Parent in connection with the Exchange and the\nTransactions. Duff & Phelps may provide valuation and financial advisory services to the Company or the\nCompany\u2019s board of directors (or any committee thereof) in the future. The information disclosed in this\nparagraph is based upon information provided to us by Duff & Phelps.\nOpinion of Robert A. Stanger & Company, Inc.\nWe retained Stanger to provide us with financial advisory services in connection with our board of directors\u2019\nconsideration of the proposed terms of the Management Agreement. We selected Stanger to act in this\ncapacity based on Stanger\u2019s qualifications, expertise and reputation in our sector, and its knowledge of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Company. As part of this engagement, our board of directors requested that\nStanger evaluate the fairness from a financial point of view of the proposed terms of the Management\nAgreement. Prior to the December 19, 2021 meeting of our board of directors, Stanger delivered its written\nopinion to our board of directors, dated December 19, 2021, that, as of that date, Stanger concluded based\nupon its analysis and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations cited in its written fairness opinion, and\nin reliance thereon, that as of the date of the fairness opinion the terms of the Management Agreement are\nfair to Bluerock Homes, from a financial point of view.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Stanger, dated as of December 19, 2021, is attached to this proxy statement as\nExhibit D and is hereby incorporated into this proxy statement by reference in its entirety. You should read the opinion\nin its entirety for a discussion of the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications\nand limitations on the review undertaken by Stanger in rendering its opinion.

Stanger\u2019s opinion\nis directed to our board of directors, in its capacity as such, in connection with its consideration of the proposed terms\nof the Management Agreement.\n61 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSummary of Materials Considered\nIn the course of Stanger\u2019s analysis to render its opinion regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nto Bluerock Homes of the terms of the Management Agreement, Stanger: (i) reviewed a copy of a\nManagement Agreement Term Sheet setting forth the key terms of the Management Agreement (the \u201cTerm\nSheet\u201d)\u037e (ii) reviewed a five-year projection model for the Bluerock Homes Business as prepared by\nmanagement of the Company\u037e (iii) reviewed the financial terms of management agreements for 12 publicly\ntraded REITs (the \u201cPublicly Traded Externally Advised REITs\u201d)\u037e (iv) reviewed the financial terms of\nmanagement agreements for 15 non-traded REITs (the \u201cNon-Traded Externally Advised REITs\u201d)\u037e and (v)\nconducted such other analyses as Stanger deemed appropriate.\nSummary of Analyses\nIn preparing its opinion for the board of directors, Stanger performed a variety of analyses, including those\ndescribed below. In rendering the opinion, Stanger applied judgment to a variety of complex analyses and\nassumptions. Stanger advised the board of directors that the preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess that involves various quantitative and qualitative judgments and determinations with respect to\nfinancial, comparative and other analytical methods and information and the application of these methods\nand information to the unique facts and circumstances presented. Stanger arrived at its opinion based on the\nresults of all analyses undertaken and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from\nor with regard to any individual analysis, analytic method or factor. The fact that any specific analysis is\nreferred to is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis.\nStanger made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after\nconsidering the results of its reviews and analyses. The assumptions made and the judgments applied in\nrendering the opinion are not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Accordingly,\nStanger advised the board of directors that its entire analysis must be considered as a whole, and that\nselecting portions of its analyses, analytical methods and the factors considered without considering all\nfactors and analyses and assumptions, qualifications and limitations of each analysis would create an\nincomplete view of the evaluation process underlying the opinion.\nStanger\u2019s opinion was provided to the board of directors in connection with the board of directors\u2019s\nconsideration of the financial terms in the Term Sheet and was one of several factors considered by the\nboard of directors in evaluating the Management Agreement. Neither Stanger\u2019s opinion nor its analyses were\ndeterminative of the terms of the Management Agreement or of the views of the board of directors. Below is\na summary of the material valuation analyses prepared in connection with Stanger\u2019s opinion.\nOverview of Reviews and Analyses\nIn conducting its reviews and analysis of the financial terms of the Term Sheet, Stanger considered, among\nother things a comparable transactions analysis.\nStanger reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of management agreements for the following Publicly\nTraded Externally Advised REITs and Non-Traded Externally Advised REITs.\n62 \n(a) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n#\nPublicly Traded Externally Advised REITs\n#\nNon-Traded Externally Advised REITs\n1.\nAmerican Finance Trust\n1.\nAres Real Estate Income Trust Inc.\n2.\nAshford Hospitality Trust\n2.\nBlack Creek Industrial REIT IV, Inc.\n3.\nBraemar Hotels and Resorts\n3.\nBlackstone Real Estate Income Trust\n4.\nBrookfield Property\n4.\nBrookfield Real Estate Income Trust, Inc.\n5.\nDiversified Healthcare Trust\n5.\nCantor Fitzgerald Income Trust, Inc.\n6.\nFront Yard Residential\n6.\nCIM Income NAV, Inc.\n7.\nGladstone Commercial\n7.\nClarion Partners Real Estate Income Fund Inc.\n8.\nGladstone Land\n8.\nCottonwood Communities, Inc.\n9.\nGlobal Medical REIT\n9.\nHines Global Income Trust, Inc.\n10.\nGlobal Net Lease\n10.\nInvesco Real Estate Income Trust\n11.\nJernigan Capital\n11.\nJones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc.\n12.\nNexpoint Residential Trust\n12.\nKKR Real Estate Select Trust, Inc.\n13.\nNuveen Global Cities REIT, Inc.\n14.\nRREEF Property Trust, Inc.\n15.\nStarwood Real Estate Income Trust, Inc.\nStanger observed that the management agreements for seven of the Publicly Traded Externally Advised\nREITs provide for a performance fee based on FFO, AFFO or core earnings (the \u201cGroup A REITs\u201d). Stanger\nadditionally observed that three of the management agreements for the Publicly Traded Externally Advised\nREITs provide for a performance fee based on the total return of the REIT over a specified period in excess of\na defined peer average (the \u201cGroup B REITs\u201d).

Stanger\n63 \n(a)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nobserved that the annual base management fee per the Term Sheet is within the range of the annual base\nmanagement fees for the Management Agreement Comparables.\nThe annual incentive fee per the Term Sheet is 20% of AFFO after stockholders receive an 8.0% annual return\non equity with no manager incentive fee catch up as compared to: (i) 15.0% of FFO to 25.0% of Core Earnings\nafter a 5.0% to 19.7% stockholder return with no manager fee catch up for the Group A REITs\u037e (ii) 5.0% to\n12.0% of the excess return over a peer average with no manager fee catch up for the Group B REITs\u037e (iii) no\nincentive fee for the Group C REITs\u037e and (iv) none to 12.50% of total return after a 5.0% to 7.0% stockholder\nreturn with a 25.0% to 100.0% manager catch up for the Group D REITs. Stanger observed that the annual\nincentive fee per the Term Sheet is within the range of the annual incentive fees for the Management\nAgreement Comparables.\nThe Term Sheet does not include a disposition fee. The disposition fee for the Group A REITs range from\nnone to 15.0% of the cumulative net gain from the sale of investments. The management agreements for the\nGroup B REITs and the Group C REITs do not provide for a disposition fee and the Group D REITs provide\nfor a disposition fee ranging from none to 2.0%. Stanger observed that the absence of a disposition fee in\nthe Term Sheet is in line with the Management Agreement Comparables.\nThe Term Sheet provides for a termination fee of 3.0x the Base and Incentive Fees earned during the 12-\nmonth period immediately preceding such termination as compared to: (i) 1.5x to 3.0x the Base and Incentive\nFees for the Group A REITs\u037e (ii) 12.0x to 22.0x of the Manager\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes and\ndepreciation (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) earned during the 12-month period immediately preceding such termination for the\nGroup B REITs\u037e (iii) no termination fees are provided for in the management agreements of the Group C\nREITs\u037e and (iv) no termination fee to the recoupment of contingent deferred fees for the Group D REITs.\nStanger observed that the termination fee per the Term Sheet is within the range of the termination fees for\nthe Management Agreement Comparables.\nThe Term Sheet provides for an internalization fee formula of 2.75x the Base and Incentive Fees earned\nduring the 12-month period immediately preceding such internalization. Stanger estimated the proposed\ninternalization fee formula per the Term Sheet was the equivalent to an implied 4.6x to 5.5x EBITDA multiple\nassuming a 40% to 50% expense ratio. The management agreements for the Group A REITs provided for an\ninternalization fee formula of 5.0x to 6.0x trailing 12-month EBITDA and the management agreements for the\nGroup B REITs, the Group C REITs and the Group D REITs do not provide an internalization fee formula.\nStanger additionally reviewed 65 precedent internalization transactions totaling over $7.6 billion (the\n\u201cPrecedent Transactions\u201d) and observed that the EBITDA multiple on the Precedent Transactions ranged\nfrom 2.0x to 13.6x, had a median of 6.4x and an average of 7.0x. Stanger observed that the internalization fee\nformula in the Term Sheet is within the range of the internalization fee formulas for the Management\nAgreement Comparables and the Precedent Transactions.\nThe Term Sheet also provides for expense reimbursements to the Manager so that Bluerock Homes will pay\nall of the costs and expenses of Bluerock Homes and will reimburse the Manager or its affiliates for\ndocumented expenses of the Manager and its affiliates incurred on behalf of Bluerock Homes that are\nreasonably necessary for the performance by the Manager of its duties and functions under the\nManagement Agreement, which may include Bluerock Homes\u2019 pro rata portion of rent, telephone, utilities,\noffice furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of the Manager and\nits affiliates required for Bluerock Homes\u2019 operations. The Term Sheet states that the Manager will be\nresponsible for the expenses related to any and all personnel of the Manager. The expense reimbursement\nprovisions of the Term Sheet are in line with the expense reimbursement provisions for the Management\nAgreement Comparables.\nConclusions\nStanger concluded based upon its analysis and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations cited in its\nwritten fairness opinion, and in reliance thereon, that as of the date of the fairness opinion the terms of the\nManagement Agreement are fair to Bluerock Homes, from a financial point of view. The issuance of the\nfairness opinion was approved by Stanger\u2019s fairness opinion committee.\n64 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nAssumptions\nIn conducting its review and rendering its opinion, Stanger assumed with the consent of the board of\ndirectors that the terms of the Management Agreement will not, when executed, differ in any material respect\nfrom the Term Sheet, including that the Management Agreement, when executed, will not require Bluerock\nHomes to internalize Bluerock Homes at any time. In rendering its opinion, Stanger has been advised that it\nmay rely upon, and therefore relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and\ncompleteness in all material respects of all financial and other information furnished or otherwise\ncommunicated to Stanger by the Company.\nLimitations and Qualifications\nStanger was not requested to, and therefore did not: (i) appraise the assets or liabilities of Bluerock Homes\u037e\n(ii) estimate or opine to the impact of the Management Agreement on the anticipated trading price of the\nBluerock Homes shares\u037e (iii) make any recommendation to the Company with respect to whether or not to\nadopt the Management Agreement or the impact, tax or otherwise, of adopting the Management Agreement\u037e\n(iv) express any opinion as to (a) the business decision to pursue the implementation of the Management\nAgreement or alternatives to the Management Agreement\u037e (b) the amount of expenses relating to the\nManagement Agreement\u037e (c) any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters\u037e or (d) any other aspect of the\nManagement Agreement other than the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Bluerock Homes of the\nterms of the Management Agreement as set forth in the Term Sheet\u037e or (v) opine as to the fairness of the\namount or the nature of any compensation or consideration to any officers, directors, or employees of any of\nthe Parties, or any class of such persons, relative to the compensation or consideration to be paid to the\nstockholders of Company common stock pursuant to the separation and distribution.\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial\nanalysis or summary description. Stanger advised the board of directors that Stanger\u2019s entire analysis must\nbe considered as a whole and that selecting portions of Stanger\u2019s analysis and the factors considered by\nStanger, without considering all analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of the evaluation\nprocess underlying the opinion.\nCompensation and Material Relationships\nStanger has been paid a fee of $250,000 in connection with this fairness opinion engagement. Stanger served\nas financial advisor to the board of directors in connection with the board of directors\u2019s review of the\nfinancial terms of the Term Sheet. Stanger will also be reimbursed for certain out-of-pocket expenses,\nincluding legal fees, and will be indemnified against liabilities arising under any applicable federal or state\nlaw or otherwise related to or arising out of Stanger\u2019s engagement or performance of its services to the\nCompany. Payment of the fairness opinion fee to Stanger was not dependent upon completion of any\ntransaction or upon the findings of Stanger with respect to fairness. Other than this fairness opinion\nengagement, during the past two years preceding the date of its opinion, Stanger has not been engaged by\nthe Company.",

Our board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other\nmatters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to determine and\ndeclare the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, to be advisable and in\nthe best interests of the Company and our stockholders and to approve the execution, delivery and\nperformance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and\nto resolve to recommend that the holders of Common Stock approve the merger.\nThese interests include:\ncontinued employment with an affiliate of the Manager for Bluerock Homes for all our executive\nofficers other than Michael L.

Vohs (Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer)\nand Michael L. Konig (Chief Legal Officer and Secretary).\nTreatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\nOur executive officers hold vested and unvested long-term incentive plan units (\u201cLTIP Units\u201d) in our\noperating partnership. Unvested LTIP Units are subject to time and/or performance-based vesting\nrequirements and may convert into units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership (\u201cOP\nUnits\u201d) upon reaching capital account equivalency with the OP Units held by the Company, and may then be\nredeemed for cash or, at the option of the Company, settled in shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one\nbasis.\nImmediately prior to the effective time of the distribution:\noutstanding and unvested time-based LTIP Units will vest in full\u037e and\noutstanding and unvested performance-based LTIP Units will vest based on the level of achievement\nof the applicable performance goals calculated through the latest practicable date prior to the\neffective time of the distribution, pro-rated to reflect the truncated performance period, and any\nportion of such unvested performance-based LTIP Units that do not so vest will be forfeited.\nNo LTIP Units held by our executive officers (other than those held by Mr. Konig) will be cashed out in\nconnection with the merger and our operating partnership will be controlled by Bluerock Homes following\nthe separation and the distribution. Following the merger effective time, the vested LTIP Units held by our\nexecutive officers (other than those held by Mr. Konig) will continue to be eligible to convert to common\nunits of the operating partnership upon reaching capital account equivalency with common units in the\noperating partnership, and may then be redeemed for cash or, at the option of Bluerock Homes, settled in\nshares of Class A common stock of Bluerock Homes.\nIn the case of Mr. Konig, who is not expected to continue his employment with Bluerock Homes after the\nmerger effective time, his vested LTIP Units will convert into shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis\nprior to the record date for the distribution and each share of Common Stock so converted that is\noutstanding as of the merger effective time will become entitled to receive (x) the per share dividend of\nBluerock Homes common stock and (y) the merger consideration. See the section entitled \u201c- Quantification of\nPotential Payments and Benefits to our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for an\nestimate of the value and benefits described above that would become payable to each of our named\nexecutive officers in respect of their LTIP Units. The estimated aggregate amounts that would become\npayable at the merger effective time to the executive officer who is not a named executive officer is as\nfollows: unvested LTIP Units\u202f-\u202f$943,824 (based on estimated performance and proration assuming the merger\neffective time occurs on March 7, 2022, and using a per unit price of $26.60, the average closing price of\nCommon Stock on the first five trading days following public announcement of the merger).\nAll of the LTIP Units held by our non-employee directors are fully vested at the time of grant pursuant to\ntheir terms.\nNone of our executive officers or directors owns any awards of restricted Common Stock.\nEmployment Payments\nThe Company has entered into employment agreements with each of its executive officers (collectively, the\n\u201cEmployment Agreements\u201d). The Employment Agreements provide certain cash severance benefits upon a\ntermination of employment by the Company without \u201ccause,\u201d or a resignation by the executive officer for\n\u201cgood reason,\u201d subject to such executive officer\u2019s execution of a general release.\nThe severance benefits under each Employment Agreement, if such termination or resignation occurs on or\nwithin 18 months following a change in control of the Company (or, in the case of Mr. Kamfar, with or\nwithout a change in control), are:\ncash severance equal to three times (or in the case of the executive officer who is not a named\nexecutive officer, one times) the sum of the executive officer\u2019s (x) annual base salary in effect at the\n67 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\ntime of termination and (y) the average of the annual bonuses paid to him with respect to the two\ncompleted calendar years prior to the year in which the employment termination occurs\u037e\na prorated target annual bonus for the year of termination\u037e and\nthe executive officer\u2019s COBRA premium under our group health plans during the executive officer\u2019s\nCOBRA continuation period (together with the cash severance and pro-rated annual bonus described\nabove, the \u201cEmployment Payments\u201d).\nUnder the merger agreement, each executive officer is entitled to the Employment Payment at the merger\neffective time (upon which time each executive officer\u2019s employment with the Company will terminate),\nsubject to (i) the executive officer\u2019s continuous employment with the Company (or a subsidiary) through the\nmerger effective time, (ii) the executive officer\u2019s execution of a customary release of claims in favor of the\nCompany and Bluerock Homes and (iii) an aggregate cap for all Employment Payments (and to the extent the\nEmployment Payments would otherwise exceed such cap, the Employment Payments for each applicable\nindividual will be reduced pro rata).\nExcept as described below, the Employment Payments will be an obligation of the Company. Under the\nmerger agreement, if any executive officer waives the Company\u2019s obligation with respect to his Employment\nPayment, (i) Bluerock Homes will instead assume such obligation, and (ii) the cash that the Company will\ncontribute to Bluerock Homes immediately prior to the effective time of the distribution will be increased by\nthe amount of such Employment Payment, as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fThe\nSeparation and the Distribution\u201d. As of the date of this proxy statement, no executive officer has waived, or\nis expected to waive, the Company\u2019s obligation to pay any Employment Payment.\nEach Employment Agreement provides that for the one-year period following the termination of the executive\nofficer\u2019s employment or its service relationship with the Company for any reason (which will occur upon the\nconsummation of the merger), he will not solicit our employees or exclusive consultants or independent\ncontractors, and for the eighteen-month period following the termination of his employment with us for any\nreason, each executive officer will not solicit our investors or customers or compete with us.\nSee the section entitled \u201c- Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to our Named Executive Officers\nin Connection with the Merger\u201d of this proxy statement for the estimated amounts of the Employment\nPayments that each of our named executive officers would be entitled to receive upon the consummation the\nmerger, assuming the merger effective time occurs on March 7, 2022. The estimated aggregate amount of the\nEmployment Payment paid in cash to the executive officer who is not a named executive officer is $703,088.\nCash Retention Program\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the Company may grant cash retention awards with an aggregate\nvalue of up to $1.5 million, with any awards to be paid in full immediately prior to the merger effective time.\nAmounts under this cash retention program will be allocated among our employees who are identified, and in\nthe amounts and on the terms determined, by our Chief Executive Officer. As of the date of this proxy\nstatement, no cash retention awards have been, or are expected to be, granted to any of our executive\nofficers.\nContinued Relationship with Bluerock Homes\nFollowing the consummation of the merger, our executive officers will cease to serve as executive officers or\nemployees of the Company, and, with the exception of Mr. Konig, will hold the same roles at Bluerock Homes\nand its Manager as they currently hold at the Company. Although they will not receive compensation from\nBluerock Homes, as executive officers, they will be eligible to receive Bluerock Homes equity awards, the\namounts and vesting terms of which will be determined by the board of directors of Bluerock Homes. In\naddition, certain of our executive officers will have ownership interests in the Manager of Bluerock Homes.\nIn connection with the separation and the distribution, the operating partnership (which will be controlled by\nBluerock Homes following the separation and the distribution) will create new series of LTIPs\n68 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nand common units (\u201cC-LTIPs\u201d and \u201cC-common units,\u201d respectively). C-LTIPs will be issued by the operating\npartnership to the Manager of Bluerock Homes pursuant to the Management Agreement. One half of each\nquarterly installment of each of the base management fee and the incentive fee under the Management\nAgreement will be payable in C-LTIPs. The remainder of each of the management fee and the incentive fee\nwill be payable in cash or in C-LTIPs, at the election of the board of directors of Bluerock Homes. Additional\nC-LTIPs will also be issuable to the executive officers of Bluerock Homes or other service providers of\nBluerock Homes at the discretion of the board of directors of Bluerock Homes.\nC-LTIPs, subject to (1) vesting in accordance with their terms and (2) achievement of capital account\nequivalency with common units in the operating partnership, may, at the option of the holder, be converted\ninto C-common units. C-common units will be redeemable at the option of the holder, and the operating\npartnership may elect to settle any such redemption in cash or Class C common stock of Bluerock Homes.\nThe terms of Class C common stock are further described below. However, Class C common stock of\nBluerock Homes will not be issuable on redemption of other common units in the operating partnership\n(which will be redeemable for cash or Class A common stock of Bluerock Homes at the election of the\noperating partnership), including those outstanding prior to the separation and the distribution.\nFollowing the consummation of the merger, our directors will cease to serve as the directors of the Company\nand will become the directors of Bluerock Homes. The non-employee directors of Bluerock Homes will be\ncompensated for their board service as determined by the Bluerock Homes board of directors.\nOwnership of Bluerock Homes Immediately Following the Distribution\nAs of the record date, our executive officers and directors or their respective affiliates held approximately\n818,724 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company, 72,964 shares of the Class C Common Stock of the\nCompany, 5,646,435 OP Units and 5,262,426 LTIP Units, representing in the aggregate an approximate 29.09%\ndirect and indirect interest in the operating partnership.\nAll of our executive officers, other than Mr. Konig, along with certain entities related to them, have agreed to\nretain their interests in the operating partnership until the earlier of the merger effective time and the\ntermination of the merger agreement, rather than redeeming their interests for cash or shares of Common\nStock. Holders of OP Units and LTIP Units, including our executive officers and their related entities, who do\nnot redeem those interests for Common Stock prior to the record date for the distribution will not receive any\nof the merger consideration in respect of their interests in the operating partnership and will instead continue\nto hold their interests in the operating partnership following the separation and distribution.\nIn the distribution, holders of our Class C Common Stock will receive shares of Class C common stock of\nBluerock Homes in the same ratio that shares of Class A common stock of Bluerock Homes will be distributed\nin respect of shares of our Class A Common Stock. Each share of Bluerock Homes Class C common stock will\nentitle its holder to up to 50 votes, whereas each share of Bluerock Homes Class A common stock will entitle\nits holder to 1 vote. However, no holder of Bluerock Homes Class C common stock will be entitled to a\nnumber of votes in respect of its shares of Bluerock Homes Class C common stock that exceeds the number\nof shares of Bluerock Homes Class C common stock, C-LTIPs, LTIPs, C-common units and other common\nunits in the operating partnership beneficially owned by such holder. Consequently, no holder of Bluerock\nHomes Class C common stock will be entitled to a number of votes in excess of the number of its direct and\nindirect economic interests in the operating partnership.\nAs a result of the separation and the distribution, including the consummation of the Exchange in\nconnection therewith, our executive officers and directors are expected to have an indirect ownership interest\nof approximately 65% in the Bluerock Homes Business through their ownership of Bluerock Homes Class A\nand Class C common stock and their continued ownership in the operating partnership (which will be\ncontrolled by Bluerock Homes following the separation and distribution). See the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u202f-\u202fThe Separation and the Distribution\u201d for more information regarding the separation and\nthe distribution, including the Exchange.\nAs described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\u201d, the\nreceipt of cash by the holders of our Common Stock pursuant to the merger, taken together with the\n69 \n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nshares of Bluerock Homes common stock to be received by them in the distribution, is expected to be treated\nas a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, the holders of OP Units and\nLTIP Units, including our executive officers and their related entities (other than Mr. Konig), are generally\nnot expected to recognize taxable gain in respect of their OP Units and LTIP Units as such OP Units and LTIP\nUnits will be retained and not cashed out in connection with the separation and the distribution or the\nmerger.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, our non-employee directors and executive officers will be\nentitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance\npolicies following the merger.\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-\nK, which requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of\nthe Company that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. For additional details regarding the terms\nof the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption \u201c- Interests of Our\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d above.\nThe amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not\nactually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the\nfootnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of\nthe merger.

This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, applicable U.S.\nTreasury Regulations, judicial opinions and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal\nRevenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), each, as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to\ndiffering interpretations and may change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or\ndiffering interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this\ndiscussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a\nposition contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. We have not sought and will not seek an\nadvance ruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this section.

The remainder of this\ndiscussion assumes that the distribution and the merger will be treated as described above.\nThere can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the treatment of the distribution and the merger\ndescribed above. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this treatment, it is possible that the distribution\nwould instead be treated as a taxable distribution separate from the deemed liquidation of the Company\npursuant to the merger. In such case, the value of the Bluerock Homes common stock distributed in the\ndistribution would not be considered part of the merger consideration. In addition, although the Company\nwill ascribe a value to the shares of the Bluerock Homes common stock distributed in the distribution, this\nvaluation is not binding on the IRS or any other taxing authority. These taxing authorities could ascribe a\nhigher valuation to the distributed Bluerock Homes common stock, particularly if, following the distribution,\nthose shares trade at prices significantly above the value ascribed to those shares by the Company. Such a\nhigher valuation may affect the distribution amount and thus the tax consequences of the distribution and\nthe merger to stockholders.",

            "text": "Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock\nGeneral\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of distributions and payments made with\nrespect to such non-U.S. holder\u2019s shares of Common Stock in connection with the merger (and the\ndistribution) will depend on various factors, including whether the receipt of such distributions and\npayments are treated as distributions from the Company that are attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs\npursuant to the provisions of FIRPTA. The IRS announced in Notice 2007-55 that it intends to take the\nposition that under current law a non-U.S. holder\u2019s receipt of a liquidating distribution from a REIT\n(including distributions and payments made in connection with the distribution and the merger, which as\nnoted, are expected to be treated as distributions in complete liquidation of the Company for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) is generally subject to tax under FIRPTA as a distribution to the extent attributable to\ngain from the sale of USRPIs. Although legislation effectively overriding Notice 2007-55 has previously been\nproposed, it is not possible to say if or when any such legislation will be enacted. Accordingly, we intend to\ntake the position that distributions and payments made with respect the Company\u2019s shares of Common Stock\npursuant to the merger (and the distribution) will be subject to tax in accordance with Notice 2007-55, subject\nto the 10% Exception, as described in more detail below. In general, the provisions governing the taxation of\ndistributions by REITs can be less favorable to non-U.S. holders than the taxation of sales or exchanges of\nREIT stock by non-U.S. holders, and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the\napplication of these provisions.\nDistribution of Gain from the Disposition of U.S. Real Property Interests\nTo the extent that the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 applies, and the 10% Exception described in\nthe next paragraph below does not apply, then, to the extent that distributions and payments received by a\nnon-U.S. holder with respect to such non-U.S. holder\u2019s Common Stock pursuant to the merger (and the\ndistribution) are treated as attributable to gain from the deemed or actual sale of Bluerock Residential\u2019s\nUSRPIs, such amounts will be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the\nnon-U.S. holder, and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis. A corporate non-U.S.\nholder will also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty).

In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be\nsubject to the branch profits tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable\nincome tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain described above.\nA non-U.S. holder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year\nof the merger (and the distribution) and who meets certain other requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax\non the gain recognized in connection with the merger (and the distribution), which may be offset by certain\nU.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder.\nIf a non-U.S. holder\u2019s shares of Common Stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by\nsuch holder on a sale of such stock will be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net\n75",

We have agreed to\nprepare and provide drafts of the separation documentation to Parent reasonably in advance of the intended\ndate for filing the forms of such documents as part of the Bluerock Homes registration statement and have\nagreed to make our applicable representatives available to Parent\u2019s representatives for purposes of\ndiscussing such drafts. We and Bluerock Homes have agreed to not file forms or drafts of the separation\ndocumentation with the SEC without the prior written approval of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,\ndelayed or conditioned).\nWe have agreed to provide a draft of the Bluerock Homes registration statement, or any amendment or\nsupplement thereto, to Parent reasonably in advance of the intended date for the filing thereof with the SEC,\nand have agreed to cause our representatives to consider in good faith, prior to the filing thereof, the\nreasonable comments of Parent and its counsel to the extent relating to descriptions of the merger agreement,\nour assets and liabilities (after giving effect to the separation) or the separation documentation. We have\nagreed to notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of\nany request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Bluerock Homes\nregistration statement and have agreed to cooperate with Parent with respect to any responses to such\ncomments. We have agreed to promptly notify Parent in writing of the effectiveness of the Bluerock Homes\nregistration statement and will consult with Parent regarding the timing of the declaration, payment and\nrecord date for the distribution.\nPrior to the separation and the distribution, we and our applicable subsidiaries have agreed to enter into the\nseparation documentation, which will contain terms consistent with the separation principles. The separation\nprinciples, which are included in Exhibit A hereto, provide that the separation and the distribution will\ngenerally be consummated pursuant to terms and conditions customary for public company spin-off\ntransactions in conjunction with a business combination transaction with a third party involving the public\ncompany or the spun-off company, to the extent not otherwise provided in the merger agreement (including\nthe separation principles). In connection with the separation, the separation principles provide, among other\nthings, that all assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries primarily related to the Bluerock\nHomes Business, including certain specific assets identified therein, will be allocated to Bluerock Homes,\nand that all other assets and liabilities will be retained by us. The separation documentation will include\ncustomary indemnification provisions pursuant to which we (after giving effect to the separation) and\nBluerock Homes will indemnify each other for certain specified losses.\nImmediately prior to the effective time of the distribution, we will contribute to Bluerock Homes an amount of\ncash equal to $185,700,000, which amount will be (x) reduced dollar-for-dollar by (i) cash used or paid by us\nor our subsidiaries after the execution of the merger agreement to acquire assets that will be\n98 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nallocated to Bluerock Homes in the separation to the extent not funded with Bluerock Homes debt, (ii) cash\nused by us or our subsidiaries after the execution of the merger agreement to pay any principal in respect of\nBluerock Homes debt, (iii) cash paid (and an equivalent amount for shares of our Common Stock issued\nabove a specified threshold) in redemption of common units of our operating partnership after the execution\nof the merger agreement, and (iv) cash held by Bluerock Homes and its subsidiaries immediately prior to such\ncontribution and (y) increased dollar-for-dollar by (i) the Employment Payments (as defined below), to the\nextent that such payments are waived by the applicable service provider(s), (ii) cash received by us and our\nsubsidiaries after the execution of the merger agreement in connection with the disposition or redemption of\nassets to be allocated to Bluerock Homes, (iii) cash proceeds received in respect of Bluerock Homes debt\nincurred after the execution of the merger agreement, to the extent that the proceeds thereof or cash received\ntherefrom are not used to acquire assets that will be allocated to Bluerock Homes in the separation, and (iv)\nthe net levered cash flow attributable to the operation of the Bluerock Homes business after the execution of\nthe merger agreement. To the extent that the cash amount referenced in the immediately prior sentence is a\nnegative number, then immediately prior to the effective time of the distribution, Bluerock Homes will\ndistribute to us an amount of cash equal to the absolute value of such cash amount.\nThe separation principles provide that Bluerock Homes will assume all assets and liabilities relating to\ncurrent and former service providers of our or our subsidiaries and employee benefit plans and agreements,\nother than (i) liabilities with respect to the restricted stock awards (as described in \u201c- Treatment of Common\nStock, Preferred Stock, Company Warrants and Equity Awards\u202f-\u202fRestricted Stock Awards\u201d) and (ii) certain\nemployment payments (the \u201cEmployment Payments\u201d) that certain service providers of ours are entitled to\nupon the consummation of the merger (subject to certain conditions), unless such Employment Payments are\nwaived by the applicable service provider(s). With respect to transaction litigation, the separation principles\nprovide that following the closing, Bluerock Homes will control the defense, settlement or prosecution of any\ntransaction litigation, but may not compromise, settle or agree to compromise or settle any such litigation\nwithout our prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Bluerock\nHomes will give the surviving company the opportunity to participate in (but not control) the defense or\nsettlement of any such litigation and will give due consideration to the surviving company advice with\nrespect to such litigation. Liabilities related to any such litigation will be borne by the surviving company, up\nto a specified deductible, then will be borne 25% by Bluerock Homes and 75% by the surviving company.\nThe separation principles provide that the consummation of the distribution will be subject to conditions\ncustomary for public company spin-off transactions, including (i) all necessary permits and authorizations\nunder the Securities Act and the Exchange Act relating to the issuance and trading of shares of common\nstock of Bluerock Homes having been obtained and being in effect and such shares of common stock of\nBluerock Homes having been approved for listing on the applicable stock exchange, (ii) our having received\nopinion(s) (which continue to be valid) in customary form from one or more nationally recognized valuation\nor accounting firms or investment banks reasonably acceptable to Parent, as to the solvency of Bluerock\nHomes after giving effect to the distribution, and (iii) certain internal restructuring steps contemplated by the\nseparation principles, including the Exchange, having been completed in all material respects.\nIn order to implement the internal restructuring steps contemplated by the separation principles, among other\nthings, our operating partnership will contribute its interests in our multi-family residential real estate\nbusiness and certain other assets to a newly-formed limited partnership (\u201cNew LP\u201d). Our operating\npartnership will then redeem all of our preferred units in the operating partnership and 25,210,092 of our\ncommon units in the operating partnership as consideration for all of the operating partnership\u2019s interests in\nNew LP in the Exchange. As a result, our operating partnership will cease to hold interests in our multi-family\nresidential real estate business, and will only hold the assets related to the Bluerock Homes Business. All of\nour executive officers, other than Mr. Konig, along with certain entities related to them, have agreed to retain\ntheir interests in the operating partnership until the earlier of the merger effective time and the termination of\nthe merger agreement, rather than redeeming their interests for cash or shares of Common Stock. As a result,\nimmediately following the separation, taking into account the equity interests of our operating partnership\nheld by the Company which are to be redeemed in the Exchange, the Company is expected to own\napproximately 35% of the Bluerock Homes Business and the holders of units in our operating partnership\n(other than the Company) will own approximately 65% of the Bluerock Homes Business. The Company\u2019s\napproximately 35% interest in the Bluerock Homes Business will then be distributed\n99 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nto our common stockholders pursuant to the distribution.

The Manager will be an affiliate of Bluerock Real Estate, L.L.C., which is an\naffiliate of our former external manager, BRG Manager, LLC. The Manager will be responsible for, among\nother things, (i) the selection, purchase and sale of Bluerock Homes\u2019 portfolio investments, (ii) Bluerock\nHomes\u2019 financing activities, and (iii) providing Bluerock Homes with advisory services. Certain individuals\nwho are currently our executive officers are expected to be executive officers of Bluerock Homes and the\nManager following the distribution, and our directors are expected to be members of the board of directors of\nBluerock Homes following the distribution. Bluerock Homes will pay the Manager a base management fee of\n1.50% per year of Bluerock Homes\u2019 new stockholders\u2019 equity, per year. Bluerock Homes will also pay the\nManager a quarterly incentive fee of an amount, not less than zero, equal to the difference between (1) the\nproduct of (i) 20% and (ii) the difference between (a) Bluerock Homes\u2019 AFFO for the previous twelve (12)-\nmonth period and (b) the product of (A) the product of (x) the weighted average of the price per share of\nequity securities of Bluerock Homes as derived from the NAV and the issue price of equity securities of\nBluerock Homes issued in future offerings and transactions, multiplied by (y) the weighted average number\nof all shares of common stock of Bluerock Homes outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (including any\nrestricted stock units, any restricted shares of common stock of Bluerock Homes, LTIP units, and other\nshares of common stock of Bluerock Homes underlying awards granted under incentive plans and units in\nthe operating partnership) in the previous twelve (12)-month period multiplied by (B) 8%, and (2) the sum of\nany incentive fee paid to our Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous\ntwelve (12)-month period\u037e provided, however, that no incentive fee is payable with respect to any calendar\nquarter unless AFFO is greater than zero for the four most recently completed calendar quarters, or the\nnumber of completed calendar quarters since the distribution date, whichever is less. For purposes of\ncalculating the incentive fee during the first 12 months after completion of the distribution, AFFO will be\ndetermined by annualizing the applicable period following completion of the distribution. One half of each\nquarterly installment of each of the base management fee and the incentive fee will be payable in C-LTIPs.\nThe remainder of each of the base management fee and the incentive fee will be payable in cash or C-LTIPs,\nat the election of Bluerock Homes\u2019 board of directors. Bluerock Homes will also reimburse the Manager for\ncertain expenses. The Management Agreement will have an initial term that will expire on the first\nanniversary of the distribution and will be automatically renewed for a one-year term on each anniversary\ndate thereafter, unless terminated or not renewed pursuant to its terms. A termination fee of 3.0x the base\nmanagement and incentive fees earned during the twelve (12) months prior to termination will be payable in\nthe event the Management Agreement is not renewed or terminated in certain circumstances. Upon an\ninternalization of the management of Bluerock Homes, the Management Agreement provides for a payment to\nthe Manager in an amount equal to 2.75x the base management and incentive fees earned during the twelve\n(12) months prior to internalization.",

With respect to the financial projections of the Company, we\nhave assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the\nCompany and we express no opinion on such projections. In addition, we have assumed that the\nTransactions and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated in\naccordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any\nterms or conditions that would be material to our analysis. We express no opinion as to the terms of\nfinancing by Buyer or the terms or conditions upon which it is obtained.
