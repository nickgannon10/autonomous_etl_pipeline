        "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER": {
            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions\nregarding the Special Meeting and the Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that\nmay be important to you as a holder of Archaea common stock. You should read the more detailed information\ncontained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to\nin this proxy statement.\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\nOn October 16, 2022, the Company and its subsidiary, Opco, entered into the Merger Agreement with\nParent, Merger Sub and Opco Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to\nthe conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the\nsurviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Opco Merger Sub will merge with and into\nOpco with Opco continuing as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nYou are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Archaea Board\nin favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the Adjournment Proposal.\nAs a holder of Archaea common stock, what will I receive in the Merger?\nEach share of Class A common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective\nTime (other than any shares of Class A common stock that are held by the Company as treasury stock or owned\nby Parent, Merger Sub, Opco Merger Sub or any other subsidiaries thereof, or any shares of Class A common\nstock as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised in accordance with Delaware law) will be\nautomatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any\napplicable withholding taxes.\nEach share of Class B common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective\nTime will be automatically canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid\ntherefor. Each holder of Class B common stock also holds an equivalent number of Opco Units. Each Opco Unit\nheld by a holder other than the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is issued and outstanding as of\nimmediately prior to the Opco Merger Effective Time will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted\ninto the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding\ntaxes. The Merger Consideration represents the aggregate consideration payable in respect of an Opco Unit and\nits corresponding share of Class B common stock.\nThe exchange of shares of Class A common stock and Opco Units for cash pursuant to the Merger will\ngenerally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the section of this proxy statement\ntitled \u201cThe Merger \u2014 Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d for a more detailed description of the\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You are urged to consult your tax advisor for a full\nunderstanding of how the Merger will affect you for federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. tax purposes.\nHow does the Merger Consideration compare to the recent trading price of the Class A common stock?\nThe Merger Consideration of $26.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 54% over the Class A\ncommon stock\u2019s closing share price on October 14, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the transaction\nannouncement. On November 11, 2022, the most recent practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement,\nthe closing price of the Class A common stock was $25.75 per share.\nWhat is the consideration payable in respect of the Class B common stock and Opco Units?\nArchaea has an \u201cup-C\u201d structure, whereby the Company\u2019s only assets are its equity interests in Opco. The\nClass B common stock represents a non-economic interest in the Company, and each holder of shares of Class B\ncommon stock holds an equivalent number of Opco Units, which represent such holder\u2019s direct economic\ninterest in Opco. As such, (i) in the Merger, each share of Class B common stock that is issued and outstanding\nas of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically canceled and extinguished without any\nconversion thereof or consideration paid therefor, and (ii) in the Opco Merger, each Opco Unit held by a holder\nother than\n1\n1Table of Contents\nthe Company or any of its subsidiaries that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Opco\nMerger Effective Time will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive cash in\nan amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. The Merger Consideration\nrepresents the aggregate consideration payable in respect of an Opco Unit and its corresponding share of\nClass B common stock.\nWhat will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the Merger?\nEach Vested RSU, Vested PSU, Director RSU, Deemed Vested RSU and Deemed Vested PSU will, at the\nEffective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and\nsubject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Class A\ncommon stock subject to such Vested RSU, Vested PSU, Director RSU, Deemed Vested RSU and Deemed Vested\nPSU, respectively, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (with performance vesting conditions for Deemed\nVested PSUs being deemed achieved at maximum levels of performance) and (ii) $26.00.\nEach Unvested RSU and Unvested PSU will, at the Effective Time, be canceled and converted into a\nDeferred Cash RSU Award or Deferred Cash PSU Award, respectively. Each Deferred Cash RSU Award or\nDeferred Cash PSU Award will, subject to the holder\u2019s continued service through the applicable vesting dates,\nvest and be payable on the earlier of (a) the same time as the Unvested RSU or Unvested PSU for which the\nDeferred Cash RSU Award or Deferred Cash PSU Award, respectively, was exchanged would have vested and\nbeen payable pursuant to its service-based vesting schedule and (b) the first anniversary of the closing date, in\neach case, subject to full accelerated vesting upon a termination of employment by the Company without\n\u201ccause\u201d or a resignation for \u201cgood reason.\u201d\nWhat will happen to the Warrants?\nEach of the Warrants will be redeemed for cash immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time in\naccordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Warrant Agreement Amendment, which provides\nthat immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, each Warrant that is issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically redeemed for the right to receive an amount, in cash,\nequal to (i) the Merger Consideration minus (ii) the Warrant Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreement and\nwhich is currently $11.50) as reduced pursuant to the calculation provided in Section 4.4 of the Warrant\nAgreement, without interest.\nWhen and where is the Special Meeting?\nThe special meeting will be held virtually on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, at 7:00 AM, Central time.\nStockholders will be able to attend the Special Meeting by visiting\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LFG2022SM and by using the 16-digit control number included in their\nproxy materials. We are conducting the Special Meeting solely online so our stockholders can participate from\nany geographic location with Internet connectivity. We believe this enhances accessibility to the Special\nMeeting for all of our stockholders and reduces the carbon footprint of our activities. We have worked to offer\nthe same rights and opportunities to participate as would be provided at an in-person meeting, while providing\nan online experience available to all stockholders regardless of their location.\nInstructions on how to attend and participate in the Special Meeting virtually are posted at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LFG2022SM. You should ensure that you have a strong Internet\nconnection and allow plenty of time to log-in and ensure that you can hear streaming audio prior to the start of\nthe Special Meeting. We will offer live technical support for all stockholders attending the Special Meeting.\nTechnical support phone numbers will be available on the virtual only meeting platform at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LFG2022SM.\nWho is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?\nOnly holders of record of common stock as of the close of business on November 9, 2022, the record date\nfor the Special Meeting, are entitled to vote the shares of common stock they held as of the record date at the\nSpecial Meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 120,645,305 shares of common stock\nissued and outstanding and entitled to vote. On each of the proposals presented at the Special Meeting, each\nholder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held by such stockholder on the\nrecord date.\n12\nTable of Contents\nMay I attend the Special Meeting and vote at the Special Meeting?\nYes. If you are an Archaea stockholder of record, you may attend the Special Meeting virtually via the\nInternet at the virtual meeting website on December 13, 2022, and complete a virtual ballot, whether or not you\nsign and return your proxy card. If you are an Archaea stockholder of record, you will need your assigned\ncontrol number to vote shares electronically at the Special Meeting. The control number can be found on the\nproxy card.\nEven if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at\nthe Special Meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying\nprepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the\ninstructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). If you attend the Special Meeting and complete a virtual\nballot, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to\nvote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or\nother nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt\nthe Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may not vote\nyour shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other\nnominee.\nWhat proposals will be considered at the Special Meeting?\nAt the Special Meeting, holders of Archaea common stock will be asked to consider and vote on the\nfollowing proposals:\n\u2022\n        \na proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (the \u201cMerger Proposal\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\n        \na proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to\nsolicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of\nthe Special Meeting.\nPursuant to Archaea\u2019s bylaws, the only business that will be transacted at the Special Meeting are the\nabove two proposals, as stated in the accompanying notice of the Special Meeting.\nI understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a\nquorum for purposes of the Special Meeting?\nThe representation in person or by proxy of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock\nentitled to vote at the Special Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The\ninspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will determine whether a quorum is present. The\ninspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a\nquorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the adjournment or\npostponement of the meeting to another date or time.\nWhat vote of Archaea stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?\nThe approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the\noutstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record date.\nAccordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to\nvote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder\u2019s bank, broker or other\nnominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger\nProposal.\nThe approval of the Adjournment Proposal shall be determined by the majority of votes cast by the\nholders of common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, shares\ndeemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to vote or a \u201cstreet\nname\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder\u2019s bank, broker or other nominee),\nabstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.\n13\nTable of Contents\nWhat is a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d?\nIf a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a bank, broker or other nominee\ndoes not provide the organization that holds the owner\u2019s shares with specific voting instructions, then, under\napplicable rules, the organization that holds the owner\u2019s shares may generally vote on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d matters\nbut cannot vote on \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d matters. A so-called \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d results when banks, brokers and\nother nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide\ndiscretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary\nauthority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of\nrelevant shares. Archaea does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules\napplicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on\nproposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is\nconsidered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be permitted to vote your shares of\ncommon stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or\nother nominee as to how to vote your shares of common stock will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.\nHow does the Archaea Board recommend that I vote?\nThe Archaea Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment\nProposal. For a discussion of the factors that the Archaea Board considered in determining to recommend that\nArchaea stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, see the section of this proxy statement titled\n\u201cThe Merger \u2014 Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Archaea Board.\u201d In addition, in considering\nthe recommendation of the Archaea Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that\ncertain of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition\nto, the interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders generally. See the section of this proxy statement titled\n\u201cThe Merger \u2014 Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of common stock before the Special Meeting?\nThe record date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you sell or\ntransfer your shares of common stock after the record date, but before the Special Meeting, you will retain your\nright to vote such shares at the Special Meeting. However, the right to receive the Merger Consideration will\npass to the person to whom you transferred your shares of Class A common stock or Opco Units (and\ncorresponding shares of Class B common stock). In order to receive the Merger Consideration in connection\nwith the Merger, you must hold your shares of Class A common stock or Opco Units (and corresponding shares\nof Class B common stock) through the Effective Time or Opco Merger Effective Time, respectively.\nWhat is a proxy?\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written\ndocument describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy\nstatement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a \u201cproxy\ncard.\u201d\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your\nproxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process\nor the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting\non all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted\non a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\n14\nTable of Contents\nHow do I cast my vote if I am a stockholder of record?\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer &\nTrust Company, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In that case,\nthis proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.\nIf you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may vote by submitting your proxy via the\nInternet, by telephone or by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid\nreply envelope. You may also vote your shares by ballot via the Internet during the Special Meeting. Even if you\nplan to attend the Special Meeting, you are encouraged to submit your vote by proxy as early as possible to\nensure that your shares will be represented. For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these\nmethods, see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Special Meeting \u2014 Voting Procedures.\u201d\nIf you are a holder of record of shares of common stock and you submit a proxy card but do not direct\nhow to vote on each item, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares in favor of each of the Merger\nProposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the Adjournment Proposal.\nHow do I cast my vote if my shares of common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank, broker or other\nnominee?\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d\nof shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you\nby your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of\nrecord.\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you must follow the\ninstructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote such shares. Your bank, broker or other\nnominee will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by properly completing the voting\ninstruction form sent to you by your bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement. Without providing\nthose instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nMerger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?\nIf you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy or\nfail to give voting instructions to your broker, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger\nProposal.\nAssuming a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions, failures to vote and failures to give\nvoting instructions to your broker will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.\nCan I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or my voting instructions?\nYes. If you are a stockholder with shares of common stock registered in your name, you may revoke your\nproxy at any time prior to the time it is voted by:\n\u2022\n        \nfiling with our Corporate Secretary a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nproperly casting a new vote via the Internet or by telephone at any time before the closure of the\nInternet or telephone voting facilities described under \u201cThe Special Meeting \u2014 Voting Procedures\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nduly completing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Corporate\nSecretary\u037e or\n\u2022\n        \nattending the Special Meeting online and voting electronically during the meeting (although\nattendance at the Special Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy).\nAny written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent so as to be delivered to our offices\nat Archaea Energy Inc., 4444 Westheimer Road, Suite G450, Houston, Texas 77027, Attention: Corporate\nSecretary, before the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting. If you want to revoke your proxy by sending a\nnew proxy card or an instrument revoking the proxy to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new\nproxy card or instrument revoking the proxy in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the\nSpecial Meeting.\n15\nTable of Contents\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you must contact your\nbank, broker or other nominee to change your vote or obtain a legal proxy to vote your shares electronically at\nthe Special Meeting.\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement or\nmultiple proxy or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares of common stock in more than\none brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which\nyou hold shares of common stock. If you are a holder of common stock of record and your shares of common\nstock are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please submit your proxy\nand/or voting instructions for each set of materials that you receive to ensure that all your shares of common\nstock are voted.\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nIf available, we may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. We\nintend to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the\nSpecial Meeting. All reports that Archaea files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more\ninformation, see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information.\u201d\nAm I entitled to rights of appraisal under the DGCL?\nIf the Merger is completed, holders of Archaea common stock who continuously hold shares of Archaea\ncommon stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,\nwho properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands, and who otherwise comply\nwith the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of\ncommon stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares\nof Archaea common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to\nreceive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Class A common stock or Opco Units (and\ncorresponding share of Class B common stock), exclusive of any elements of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the amount determined to be fair value, if\nany, as determined by the court (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference between the\namount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the\nentry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding). Holders of Archaea common stock who wish to seek appraisal of\ntheir shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of\nappraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL\nfor exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and Section 262 of the\nDGCL regarding appraisal rights is accessible without subscription or cost at the following publicly available\nwebsite: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply with the provisions\nof Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. See the\nsection of this proxy statement titled \u201cAppraisal Rights.\u201d\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\nWe are working toward completing the Merger as promptly as possible, and the parties to the Merger\nAgreement are targeting completing the Merger by the end of 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of\nthe Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger\nAgreement, some of which are outside of our control.\nWhat effect will the Merger have on Archaea?\nIf the Merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Archaea, the separate corporate\nexistence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease, and Archaea will continue to exist following the Merger as a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Following completion of the Merger, shares of Class A common stock will be\ndelisted from the NYSE, and the registration of shares of Class A common stock under the Exchange Act will be\nterminated.\n16\nTable of Contents\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nIf the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any\nother reason, the holders of Archaea common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of Archaea\ncommon stock or Opco Units in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company would remain an\nindependent public company and stockholders would continue to own their shares of Archaea common stock\nand Opco Units. The Class A common stock would continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed\nand traded on the NYSE. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, Archaea may be obligated\nto pay to Parent a termination fee. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement \u2014 Termination Fees and Expenses.\u201d\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more\nstockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance\nnotice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of\nthe meeting and proxy card. If your shares are held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you will receive your voting instruction\nform from your bank, broker or other nominee and you will return your voting instruction form to your bank,\nbroker or other nominee. You should vote on and sign each proxy card or voting instruction form you receive as\ndiscussed above. To request that only one copy of any of these materials be mailed to your household, please\ncontact your bank, broker or other nominee.\nWho can help answer my questions?\nIf you need assistance in completing your proxy card or have questions regarding the Special Meeting,\nplease contact Archaea\u2019s proxy solicitor:\nD.F.

As a result, since the completion of the Company\u2019s business combination with Aria\nEnergy LLC and Archaea Energy LLC in September 2021, representatives of the Company have from time to time\nengaged in discussions with representatives of other companies in, or interested in, the biogas industry, as well\nas financial sponsors regarding such financial and strategic opportunities available to the Company. In addition,\nParent and the Company are party to the Mavrix LLC joint venture (the \u201cMavrix Joint Venture\u201d), and, from time to\ntime, Parent and the Company have met to discuss matters relating to the Mavrix Joint Venture.\nOn February 8, 2022, members of Company management met with representatives of Parent during an\nindustry event, during which time the parties discussed the biogas industry generally and matters relating to the\nMavrix Joint Venture.\nOn April 28, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase\nNextGen Power Holdings LLC (\u201cINGENCO\u201d) for $215 million in cash.\nOn May 5, 2022, the Company announced a joint venture (the \u201cLightning Joint Venture\u201d) with Republic\nServices, Inc. (\u201cRepublic\u201d) to develop RNG projects across the country. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive\nagreements governing the Lightning Joint Venture, the Company was required to contribute approximately\n$800 million to the joint venture over the course of five years.\nOn June 3, 2022, members of Company management and representatives of Parent had a call to discuss,\namong other things, the biogas industry generally, during which time Parent expressed an interest in expanding\nin the biogas industry and learning more about the Company\u2019s business. Representatives of Parent expressed\ninterest in a variety of potential transactions and projects with the Company. No financial or other material terms\nof any potential transaction with the Company were discussed on the call.\nOn June 16, 2022, during a meeting between members of Company management and representatives of\nParent to discuss matters relating to the Mavrix Joint Venture, representatives of Parent again expressed an\ninterest in the Company\u2019s business beyond that joint venture, and, at the request of Parent, the Company\ndiscussed with representatives of Parent publicly available information relating to the Company\u2019s broader\nbusiness and financial results.\nIn addition, over the course of the summer of 2022 and after the announcement of the Lightning Joint\nVenture, a number of financial parties, including parties referred to herein as \u201cParty A\u201d, \u201cParty B\u201d, and \u201cParty C\u201d,\nmet with members of Company management and Daniel J.

During the course of such\ndiscussions, these financial parties expressed an interest in the Company, including in potentially participating in\na variety of potential transactions with the Company, ranging from (i) financing transactions to finance the\nINGENCO purchase, the Lightning Joint Venture capital contributions and other capital expenditures within the\nCompany\u2019s development plan to (ii) potential strategic transactions to allow such financial parties to\nmeaningfully participate in the growing biogas industry. No financial or other material terms of a potential\nacquisition of the Company were discussed at any of these meetings.\n30Table of Contents\nOn June 24, 2022, given the increasing interest from the various parties noted above in a wide range of\ntransactions with the Company, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of\nKirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d), legal advisor to the Company, in attendance to discuss the interest of such\nparties, including whether any engagement with such parties in respect of strategic transactions was appropriate\nat the time in light of the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties. During this meeting, the Board discussed the outreach from\nParty A, Party B, Party C and Parent. Representatives of Kirkland also provided the Board with a review of the\nBoard\u2019s fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in the context of the interest expressed by third parties in\nexploring strategic alternatives with the Company and the Board\u2019s potential consideration of strategic\nalternatives. Next, the Board discussed and considered the potential benefits and risks of conducting a targeted\nassessment to help the Board determine how best to maximize value for stockholders, including considerations\nsuch as the relative scarcity of RNG assets at the Company\u2019s scale, which could drive further interest in the\nCompany as part of a marketed process given the overall market dynamics. The Board also discussed and\nconsidered the risks to the Company and its business inherent in a potential market check, including demands on\nmanagement\u2019s time and attention and the risk of leaks. Taking into consideration the foregoing, the Board\ndetermined that an initial step of engaging with a financial advisor to assist the Board in considering the benefits\nand risks of a targeted market check was warranted, including to provide additional perspective for the Board\nand the Company\u2019s management in ongoing interactions with the various parties expressing interest in engaging\nwith the Company. At the end of the meeting, the Board authorized Company management and Mr. Rice to\nengage with potential financial advisors to meet with the Board.\nOver the course of the next several days, Company management and Mr. Rice considered the engagement\nof several financial advisors to meet with the Board to discuss a potential market check process and determined\nto introduce representatives of BofA Securities to the Board following a meeting between representatives of\nBofA Securities and Company management where representatives of BofA Securities noted that significant time\nand attention would be dedicated to the potential engagement by its senior leadership team with significant\nexperience in the energy and infrastructure spaces.\nOn June 30, 2022, during a call between members of Company management and representatives of Parent\nto discuss matters relating to the Mavrix Joint Venture, representatives of Parent asked, and Company\nmanagement answered, a number of questions relating to the Company\u2019s business generally and the Company\u2019s\nfunding obligations relating to the Lightning Joint Venture.\nThat same day, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of Kirkland in\nattendance and, for a portion of such meeting, representatives of BofA Securities in attendance to interview\nrepresentatives of BofA Securities as a potential financial advisor to the Board. During its meeting with the\nBoard, BofA Securities highlighted its experience in the energy and infrastructure industries as well as its ability\nto connect with senior members of various potential strategic and financial parties that might be interested in a\nstrategic transaction with the Company. Following such meeting, the Board, having considered BofA Securities\u2019\ncredentials, expertise and experience, determined to retain BofA Securities to act as financial advisor to the Board\nin connection with the Board\u2019s review of strategic alternatives. The Board also discussed potential next steps,\nincluding the need for the Company to prepare financial forecasts in order for BofA Securities to perform a\nfinancial analysis of the Company, and directed Company management to prepare such financial forecasts.\nOver the course of the next several weeks, Company management developed financial forecasts as\npreviously directed by the Board in order to permit BofA Securities to present the Board with a preliminary\nfinancial analysis and also to assist in the Board\u2019s consideration of whether a market check might be warranted.\nOn July 13, 2022, representatives of Parent had a call with a member of the Company\u2019s management to\ndiscuss Parent\u2019s questions regarding the Company\u2019s financial metrics and ownership structure.\nOn July 24, 2022, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of each of\nKirkland and BofA Securities in attendance to review the financial forecast prepared by Company management,\nto review BofA Securities\u2019 preliminary financial analysis and to discuss potential bidders that would most likely\nbe interested in a potential acquisition of the Company. During the meeting, the Board reviewed the financial\nforecast prepared by the Company\u2019s management at the direction of the Board (the \u201cJuly Forecasts,\u201d as\ndescribed further in the section entitled \u201c\u2014 Certain Financial Projections\u201d) and engaged in a discussion\nregarding the key assumptions and other factors underlying such financial forecasts. Representatives of BofA\nSecurities also reviewed BofA Securities\u2019 preliminary financial analysis based on the July Forecasts and provided\nan overview of conditions in the debt and equity markets and mergers and acquisitions market. The Board also\ndiscussed with Company management\n31\nTable of Contents\nand advisors the potential bidders, both financial and strategic, including the parties noted above, that would\nlikely have both the interest and financial capacity to engage in a potential acquisition of the Company, as well\nas the risks and benefits of reaching out to multiple bidders and potential impediments or challenges associated\nwith such parties pursuing a potential acquisition of the Company. Following discussion by the Board\nhighlighting the benefits and risks of assessing the Company\u2019s valuation in a potential sale through the\nengagement with a targeted group of potential buyers, the Board directed Company management to begin, with\nthe assistance of BofA Securities, exploring a process for a potential sale with a targeted group of financial\nparties and strategic parties and to report back to the Board with a process timeline and suggested potential\nfinancial and strategic bidders to involve in such a process.\nOn July 26, 2022, the Company signed an engagement letter with BofA Securities.\nOn July 28, 2022, representatives of Parent had a call with a member of the Company\u2019s management. During\nthe call, representatives of Parent informed the Company that Parent was considering submitting a preliminary\nnon-binding proposal for the acquisition of the Company, and representatives of the Company informed\nrepresentatives of Parent that the Company had retained BofA Securities to act as financial advisor to the Board\nand that representatives of BofA Securities would reach out to Parent to discuss next steps, if the Board\ndetermined such actions appropriate.\nOn August 2, 2022, the Board met at a regularly scheduled meeting with members of Company management\nand representatives of each of Kirkland and BofA Securities in attendance to further discuss considerations\nrelating to conducting a market check and to refine a list of potential bidders to involve in such a market check.\nThe Board specifically discussed the pros and cons of running a targeted market check and considered a number\nof factors in determining the scope of a potential market check process, including (i) the business risk associated\nwith involving strategic buyers and potential disclosure of confidential information to industry participants,\n(ii) the risk of leaks and the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with contacting more potential bidders\nversus fewer, (iii) the potential for increased management distraction and (iv) the fact that certain parties had\nalready expressed an interest in the Company. Representatives of BofA Securities expressed their views that, if\nthe Board were to explore a potential sale, it would be beneficial to commence discussions with a targeted group\nof both potential financial buyers as well as potential strategic buyers as the two types of bidders have different\nstrategic and market objectives that would help create competition in a sale process. In this context, the Board\ndiscussed with the Company\u2019s management and advisors the identities of parties which would likely be\ninterested in pursuing a strategic transaction with the Company, including those that had already expressed an\ninterest in various types of transactions with the Company. Following discussions highlighting the benefits and\nrisks of assessing the Company\u2019s valuation in a potential sale through the engagement with a targeted group of\npotential buyers in a targeted market check, the Board directed members of Company management, together with\nrepresentatives of BofA Securities, to (i) begin conducting a targeted market check involving parties that had\npreviously expressed interest in the Company and certain additional strategic and financial parties and\n(ii) facilitate such parties\u2019 due diligence of the Company, subject to such parties entering into suitable\nconfidentiality agreements.\nOn August 3, 2022, after being contacted by representatives of BofA Securities, representatives of Parent\ncalled Mr. Rice to inform Mr. Rice that Parent was considering imminently submitting a proposal to acquire the\nCompany, independent of the process being run by BofA Securities. Mr. Rice encouraged representatives of\nParent to participate in the process being run by BofA Securities.\nDuring the beginning of August, at the request of the Board, representatives of BofA Securities contacted\nfive financial parties selected by the Board, including Party A, Party B, and the parties referred to herein as\n\u201cParty D\u201d, \u201cParty E\u201d, \u201cParty F\u201d, and three strategic parties selected by the Board, including Parent and parties\nreferred to herein \u201cParty G\u201d and \u201cParty H\u201d, and provided draft confidentiality agreements prepared by Kirkland\nto such parties. Two of the parties, Party F and Party H, informed BofA Securities that they did not wish to\nparticipate in the potential sale process and did not execute a confidentiality agreement. Party C and one\nadditional financial party, referred to herein as \u201cParty I\u201d, expressed an unsolicited interest in participating in the\nmarket check and were subsequently included in the process at the direction of the Board. Party C and Party I\nwere not included in the initial targeted list of potential buyers selected by the Board on August 2, 2022 as such\nparties had not previously demonstrated any interest in a potential acquisition of the Company. BofA Securities\nprovided draft confidentiality agreements prepared by Kirkland to these two additional parties. The Company\nultimately entered into confidentiality agreements with seven parties, including Party A, Party B, Party C, Party\nD, Party E, Party G and Parent. These\n32\nTable of Contents\nconfidentiality agreements contained customary \u201cstandstill\u201d provisions that would automatically terminate upon\nthe entry by the Company into a definitive acquisition agreement with a third party. The Company and BofA\nSecurities also granted access to a virtual data room containing due diligence information relating to the\nCompany to each of the seven parties that entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company.\nIn August and early September, members of Company management held management presentations with\neach of the seven parties that had executed a confidentiality agreement. From the beginning of August until the\nexecution of the merger agreement on October 16, 2022 (or, if earlier, the date on which a party engaged in the\npotential sale process ceased to pursue a potential transaction), each of the potential buyer parties conducted\ndue diligence that included some combination of access to a virtual data room, receipt of a confidential\ninformation memorandum, review of additional documentary materials, virtual and in-person diligence sessions\n(including site visits) and other customary due diligence.\nDuring the last two weeks of August and at the direction of the Board, an instruction letter requesting\ninitial non-binding indications of interest by September 1, 2022 with respect to a transaction was provided by\nBofA Securities to the seven parties that had entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company by such\ndate.\nOn August 24, 2022 and at the request of Parent, Nick Stork, Chief Executive Officer of the Company and\nmember of the Board, and Mr. Rice met with representatives of Parent for dinner, during which they discussed\nParent\u2019s operations and strategic rationale for a potential transaction. No financial or other material terms of any\npotential transaction with the Company were discussed, and no post-closing employment or compensation with\nrespect to Mr. Stork or any other members of management were discussed.\nOn August 30, 2022, Parent delivered to BofA Securities a letter setting forth a preliminary, non-binding\nproposal to acquire the Company for $24.00 in cash per share. In the letter, Parent indicated that its offer was\nsubject to completion of diligence and Republic delivering a waiver of certain of Republic\u2019s rights under the joint\nventure agreements relating to the Lightning Joint Venture prior to signing of any merger agreement. In addition,\nParent indicated that it expected that it would receive customary voting and support agreements signed by\nprincipal insider stockholders of the Company.\nOn September 1, 2022, Party B delivered to BofA Securities a letter setting forth a preliminary, non-binding\nproposal to acquire the Company for $23.75 in cash per share. In the letter, Party B indicated that its offer was\nsubject to completion of diligence. The letter did not include a requirement for Republic to deliver a waiver.\nOn September 2, 2022, Party C delivered to BofA Securities a letter setting forth a preliminary, non-binding\nproposal to acquire the Company for $18.00 in cash per share. In the letter, Party C indicated that its offer was\nsubject to completion of diligence. The letter did not include a requirement for Republic to deliver a waiver.\nOn September 5, 2022, as instructed by the Company and in response to an inquiry from representatives of\nParent, representatives of BofA Securities notified the representatives of Morgan Stanley, Parent\u2019s financial\nadvisor, that Parent will likely be advanced to participate in the second round of the process, subject to the\nBoard\u2019s final determination, but encouraged Parent to improve their proposed price in order to be more\ncompetitive.\nOn September 8, 2022, representatives of Party D informed representatives of BofA Securities that Party D\nwas no longer interested in a potential transaction and would cease to participate in the potential sale process.\nOn September 9, 2022, Party A delivered to BofA Securities a letter setting forth a preliminary, non-binding\nproposal to acquire the Company for $22.50 in cash per share. In the letter, Party A indicated that its offer was\nsubject to completion of diligence and Republic delivering a waiver of certain of Republic\u2019s rights under the joint\nventure agreements relating to the Lightning Joint Venture prior to signing of any merger agreement.\nOn September 9, 2022, representatives of Party E informed representatives of BofA Securities that Party E\nwas no longer interested in a potential transaction and would cease to participate in the potential sale process.\nOn September 10, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of each of BofA Securities and Kirkland in attendance to review the preliminary proposals\nreceived to date and discuss next steps in the process. At the meeting, representatives of BofA Securities\nreviewed with the Board the\n33\nTable of Contents\nstatus of the process, including the parties that had dropped out of consideration and the preliminary proposals\nreceived from Parent, Party B, Party C and Party A. The presentation to the Board included considerations\nrelating to the fact that each of Parent and Party A requested that Republic deliver certain waivers under its joint\nventure agreements relating to the Lightning Joint Venture. The Board considered a number of factors, including\n(i) that Party A had missed the deadline for submission of preliminary proposals, (ii) that Party B had the highest\nlevel of due diligence activity among the bidders, (iii) Company management\u2019s and BofA Securities\u2019 belief that\nthere was a low likelihood that Party G would be prepared to submit a definitive proposal on a timely basis,\n(iv) Party C\u2019s preliminary proposal of $18.00 in cash per share was significantly lower than the other preliminary\nproposals, (v) Parent was the only strategic bidder to submit a preliminarily proposal and the potential benefits\nof including another strategic bidder in the process and (vi) Party I has been unable to execute a confidentiality\nagreement. Following these discussions and deliberations, the Board directed BofA Securities to terminate\ndiscussions with Party C and Party I, solicit improved definitive proposals with respect to a transaction from\neach of Parent, Party A and Party B and encourage Party G to submit a proposal with respect to a transaction in\norder to generate additional interest from another strategic bidder.\nNext, representatives of Kirkland reviewed with the Board a summary of two draft merger agreements (one\nfor financial bidders, and another for strategic bidders) prepared by Kirkland that contemplated, among other\nthings, a \u201ccompany termination fee\u201d equal to 2.5% of the transaction equity value payable by the Company in\nthe event the merger agreement was terminated under certain circumstances and customary \u201cno shop\u201d\nprovisions and a \u201chell or high water\u201d regulatory commitment by the buyer to obtain the required regulatory\napprovals to close the transaction. Following such review, the Board directed members of Company management\nand Kirkland to finalize the draft merger agreement and BofA Securities to provide the draft merger agreement to\nthe bidders still participating in the process.\nFollowing the meeting and over the following days, representatives of the Company and/or BofA\nSecurities contacted (i) representatives of each of Party C and Party I to inform such party that the Company was\nterminating discussions with such party, (ii) representatives of each of Parent, Party A and Party B to encourage\nsuch party to submit improved definitive proposals with respect to a transaction and increase its bid price,\nnoting that there was a small number of other bidders, that the range of bid prices was tight, and that each such\nparty should increase its bid price in order to be more competitive and (iii) representatives of Party G to\nencourage such party to submit a proposal with respect to a transaction.\nOver the course of August and September 2022, as instructed by the Board, representatives of BofA\nSecurities made available in the virtual data room incremental refinements and updates to the July Forecasts\nprepared by the Company\u2019s management at the direction of the Board in order to reflect more current information\nand expectations regarding, among other things, (i) contracted portfolio assumptions, (ii) royalty payment\nassumptions, (iii) certain joint venture project assumptions, (iv) amortization payment schedules for the\nCompany\u2019s indebtedness and (v) completion of delivery dates for certain projects and end dates for certain gas\nrights agreements. The final updated financial forecasts made available in the virtual data room on or around\nSeptember 14, 2022 (the \u201cSeptember Forecasts\u201d) are described further in the section entitled \u201c\u2014 Certain Financial\nProjections\u201d).\nOn September 15, 2022, as instructed by the Board, representatives of Kirkland provided two draft merger\nagreements (one for financial bidders, and another for strategic bidders) to BofA Securities, which were\nsubsequently uploaded to the virtual data room and made available to each of Parent, Party A, Party B and Party\nG.\nOn September 20, 2022, as instructed by the Board, representatives of BofA Securities delivered to Parent,\nParty A, Party B and Party G an instruction letter requesting definitive proposals by October 5, 2022 and markups\nof the draft merger agreement by September 28, 2022. As of the date of this proxy statement, no proposal was\nsubmitted to the Company by Party G.\nOn September 21, 2022, Parent submitted an updated non-binding proposal letter to acquire the Company\nat a price of $27.00 per share in cash, a mark-up of the draft merger agreement and a draft exclusivity agreement.\nIn the proposal letter, Parent expressed a desire to negotiate and ultimately announce a transaction before the\nstated October 5th, 2022 bid deadline, requested exclusivity, and indicated that its proposal was subject to the\ncompletion of diligence, Republic delivering the previously contemplated waiver and that certain principal insider\nstockholders deliver customary voting and support agreements. The markup of the draft merger agreement\nproposed, among other things, a company termination fee equal to 3.5% of the transaction equity value, and\nprovided that Parent would not\n34\nTable of Contents\nbe required to make any divestitures or commit to any conduct remedies to obtain regulatory approvals to close\nthe transaction, but would be willing to pay a reciprocal \u201creverse termination fee\u201d of 3.5% of the transaction\nequity value if certain specified regulatory-related closing conditions were not met.\nOn September 22, 2022, Mr. Rice and representatives of Parent had a call to discuss Parent\u2019s updated\nproposal, including the Company\u2019s approach to regulatory matters, initial views on Parent\u2019s request for a waiver\nfrom Republic, Parent\u2019s request for exclusivity, Parent\u2019s proposed termination fees and Parent\u2019s desired timing to\nannounce and consummate a potential transaction. Mr. Rice informed representatives of Parent that, because of\nthe many key open issues, it was unlikely the Board would agree to grant exclusivity at that time.\nOn September 23, 2022, Mr. Rice and representatives of Parent had a call to discuss strategy with respect\nto approaching Republic with respect to a waiver of certain of their rights under the joint venture agreements\nrelating to the Lightning Joint Venture. On the same day, representatives of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP\n(\u201cFreshfields\u201d), legal counsel to Parent, provided a draft of the Republic waiver to representatives of Kirkland.\nOn September 24 and September 25, 2022, Mr. Rice provided updates to the other directors with respect to,\nand further discussed, Parent\u2019s updated proposal. The Board was supportive of the Company and its advisors\nnegotiating the terms of the draft merger agreement with Parent and its advisors, and not engaging with Parent\u2019s\nrequest for exclusivity.\nAlso on September 24, representatives of Kirkland conveyed to representatives of Freshfields the\nCompany\u2019s proposal on certain key issues in the merger agreement, including that Parent would be required to\nuse general reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals required to close the transaction (without an\nexpress commitment with respect to divestitures and conduct remedies) and to pay a reverse termination fee of\n15% of the transaction equity value if certain specified regulatory-related closing conditions were not met.\nKirkland also proposed a bifurcated company termination fee equal to (i) 0.50% of the transaction equity value in\nthe case of a competing transaction with a bidder who participated in the Company\u2019s outreach process and\n(ii) 2.75% of the transaction equity value in the case of an interloper who was not part of the Company\u2019s\noutreach process.\nLater in the evening on September 24, 2022, representatives of Kirkland sent to representatives of\nFreshfields a revised draft of the merger agreement and Mr. Rice and representatives of Parent had a call to\ndiscuss open issues relating to the merger agreement.\nOn September 25, 2022, at the request of Parent, Messrs. Stork and Rice met with representatives of Parent\nfor dinner, during which the parties discussed Parent\u2019s strategic rationale for a potential transaction and the\nCompany\u2019s business. No post-closing employment or compensation with respect to Mr. Stork or any other\nmembers of management were discussed.\nOn September 27, 2022, representatives of Party B informed representatives of BofA Securities that Party B\nwas no longer interested in a potential transaction as a result of volatility in financing markets and its belief that\nit would be unable to provide a higher offer price than the $23.75 per share price set forth in its preliminary, non-\nbinding proposal delivered on September 1, 2022, and Party B would cease to participate in the potential sale\nprocess.\nAlso on the same day, representatives of Freshfields and Kirkland held various calls to discuss the merger\nagreement. Over the course of the day, representatives of Freshfields provided to representatives of Kirkland a\nproposal on certain open merger agreement issues and proposed processes for finalizing various related\ndocumentation. Among other things, representatives of Freshfields, on behalf of Parent, proposed (i) a company\ntermination fee of 4.00% of the transaction equity value (regardless of whether an interloper had been part of the\nCompany\u2019s process) and (ii) a reverse termination fee of 8.50% of the transaction equity value, provided that\nParent would have no obligations to make divestitures or commit to conduct remedies to secure regulatory\napprovals for the transaction.\nLater on the same day, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of each\nof Kirkland and BofA Securities present. During the meeting, representatives of BofA Securities provided the\nBoard with an update on the process, including that Party B had withdrawn from the process for the reasons\ndescribed\n35\nTable of Contents\nabove and that Party A would not be able to submit a revised proposal until October 7, 2022 due to the need for\nadditional time to obtain investment committee approval. The Board then reviewed the relationship disclosure\nletter provided by BofA Securities. This letter detailed BofA Securities\u2019 interests in and relationships with the\nremaining bidders. Next, representatives of BofA Securities reviewed with the Board its updated preliminary\nfinancial analysis based on the September Forecasts. The Company\u2019s advisors also reviewed with the Board the\nterms of Parent\u2019s updated proposal, including Parent\u2019s desire to negotiate and ultimately announce a transaction\nbefore the stated October 5th, 2022 bid deadline, Parent\u2019s request for a Republic waiver as a condition to signing\nof the merger agreement and remaining key open issues relating to the draft merger agreement. The Board\nconsidered with Company management and advisors whether to facilitate discussions between Parent and\nRepublic relating to the Republic waiver, taking into account (i) the fact that Party B had withdrawn from the\nprocess, (ii) the fact that Party A had indicated it would be delayed in submitting a definitive proposal for the\nreason stated above, (iii) the fact that Parent\u2019s $27.00 per share offer price is meaningfully higher than the offer\nprice set forth in any other indication of interest delivered to date and (iv) the fact that Parent indicated a desire\nto complete diligence and announce a transaction in the near future. Following these discussions and\ndeliberations, the Board instructed Company management and the Company\u2019s advisors to continue engaging\nwith Parent and facilitate discussions between Parent and Republic relating to a waiver given the strength of\nParent\u2019s bid.\nIn the evening on September 27, 2022, a representative of Parent had a call with Mr. Rice to discuss certain\nof the key points in the merger agreement. Among other things, the parties discussed (i) a company termination\nfee of 3.50% of the transaction equity value (regardless of whether an interloper had been part of the Company\u2019s\nprocess) and (ii) a reverse termination fee of 10.00% of the transaction equity value, provided that Parent would\nhave no obligations to make divestitures or commit to conduct remedies to secure regulatory approvals for the\ntransaction.\nEarly on September 28, 2022, representatives of Freshfields sent representatives of Kirkland a revised draft\nof the merger agreement, providing for, among other things, the company termination fee and reverse termination\nfee previously discussed by the Company and Parent.\nThroughout the end of September 2022 until the signing of the merger agreement, the Company, with the\nassistance of BofA Securities and Kirkland, continued discussions with Parent and its representatives and\nadvisors and discussed the proposed terms of the merger agreement and other transactions documents,\nincluding, among other things, the interim operating covenants, treatment of equity awards and scope of the\nrepresentations and warranties.\nOn September 29, 2022 and consistent with the direction of the Board, Mr. Rice called a representative of\nRepublic to inform him that the Company was in discussions with Parent regarding a potential sale transaction\nand the importance of Republic\u2019s support of the potential sale transaction. Thereafter, representatives of Parent,\nwith the assistance of members of Company management and representatives of each of Freshfields, Kirkland\nand BofA Securities, continued discussions with representatives of Republic in relation to the terms between\nParent and Republic for the Republic waiver and the documentation thereof.\nOn October 3, 2022, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of each of\nKirkland and BofA Securities present. During the meeting, representatives of BofA Securities noted that Party A\nremained engaged and was continuing its diligence. Representatives of Kirkland and members of Company\nmanagement provided the Board with an update on negotiations of the draft merger agreement and the status of\ndiscussions relating to the Republic waiver. Additionally, the Board discussed a request by Parent to begin\nnegotiating voting agreements between Parent and certain stockholders of the Company to support the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement. After discussion of the expected terms of such voting\nagreement, the Board directed Kirkland to inform Parent and its legal advisors that Parent and its legal advisors\nhad the Board\u2019s approval to begin negotiations of such voting agreements with the applicable stockholders.\nBetween October 4, 2022, and signing of the merger agreement, representatives of Kirkland, Freshfields\nand the stockholders to be party to the Voting Agreement exchanged drafts of the voting agreement and other\nrelated transaction documents (including drafts of the Warrant Agreement Amendment, Opco LLC Agreement\nAmendment and the Unitholder Representative Engagement Letter and spoke by telephone and corresponded\nby email to discuss those drafts.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOn October 5, 2022, the Company received an unsolicited non-binding expression of interest from a\nfinancial party, referred to herein as \u201cParty J\u201d, to acquire the Company at a price of $23.50 to $28.50 per share in\ncash. The letter stated that its proposal was subject to confirmatory diligence, and that Party J could complete its\ndue diligence in six weeks.\nOn the same day, as instructed by the Board, a representative of BofA contacted a representative of Parent\nto urge Parent to expedite progress on obtaining the waiver from Republic and finalizing the definitive\ndocumentation for the merger and indicated that the price in Parent\u2019s most recent proposal may still need to be\nincreased for Parent to prevail.\nOn October 6, 2022, representatives of counsel to Party A contacted Mr. Rice and representatives of\nKirkland to inform Mr. Rice and Kirkland that Party A would be providing a markup of the merger agreement later\nthe same day or the following day.\nLater on the same day, representatives of Freshfields separately called representatives of each of Jones\nDay, management\u2019s separate counsel, and Kirkland to convey Parent\u2019s requirement that each of Mr. Stork,\nRichard Walton and Brian McCarthy would execute employment offer letters with Parent concurrently with\nsigning of the merger agreement.\nOn October 7, 2022, representatives of Party A submitted to representatives of BofA Securities a definitive\nproposal for $19.50 per share, along with markup of merger agreement. On the same day, representatives of\nParent and representatives of the Company discussed several issues relating to the merger agreement, including\nwith respect to interim operating covenants.\nLater on October 7, 2022, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of\neach of Kirkland and BofA Securities present to review Party A\u2019s definitive proposal and Party J\u2019s preliminary\nexpression of interest and to discuss considerations relating to Parent\u2019s request to discuss employment offer\nletters with members of Company management. First, representatives of BofA Securities reviewed with the Board\nParty A\u2019s definitive proposal to acquire the Company for $19.50 per share in cash, expressing its views that Party\nA, as a financial buyer, is unlikely to be able to significantly increase its offer price given conditions in the\nfinancing markets. Representatives of BofA Securities also reviewed with the Board Party J\u2019s preliminary non-\nbinding expression of interest, noting that Party J indicated that it would require six weeks to complete its due\ndiligence and that Party J has not yet been provided any non-public due diligence information. The Board also\ndiscussed and considered with Company management and its advisors the likelihood that any definitive offer by\nParty J following completion of due diligence would be meaningfully differentiated from the offers provided by\nthe other financial parties, Party A and Party B, given that Party J likely faced the same financing concerns\nexpressed by such other financial parties. Next, members of Company management provided an update on\ndiscussions between Parent and Republic relating to the Republic waiver, noting that discussions were ongoing.\nLastly, representatives of Kirkland recounted Parent\u2019s request for employment discussions with certain members\nof Company management and Parent\u2019s requirement that certain members of Company management execute\nemployment offer letters concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement. Following these discussions\nand deliberations, the Board determined that Company management and advisors should (i) contact Party J to\ndetermine its ability to complete its diligence and announce a potential transaction on an expedited basis,\n(ii) continue negotiating the terms of the draft merger agreement with representatives of Parent and its advisors\nand (iii) encourage Parent to finalize the waiver with Republic. The Board determined that it would meet to further\ndiscuss Parent\u2019s request to discuss employment offer letters with Company management at a later date after\nRepublic and Parent reach agreement as to the terms of a Republic waiver and directed Company management\nnot to engage in any discussions relating to future employment with Parent until authorized by the Board.\nOn October 8, 2022, as instructed by the Board, representatives of BofA Securities contacted\nrepresentatives of Party J to determine its ability to complete its diligence and announce a transaction on an\naccelerated basis. The parties discussed considerations relating to Party J\u2019s expected due diligence timeline, and\nrepresentatives of Party J informed representatives of BofA Securities that Party J would require at least\nfour weeks to announce a transaction.\nOn October 11, 2022, representatives of Parent contacted Mr. Rice to convey that Parent was lowering its\noffer to $25.00 per share in cash based on variances in Parent\u2019s modeled cost structure for the Company relative\nto Parent\u2019s findings during due diligence on the Company.\n37\nTable of Contents\nLater on the same day, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of each\nof Kirkland and BofA Securities present to discuss the status of Republic discussions and next steps relating to\nParent\u2019s revised proposal on deal price. Members of Company management reported to the Board that\nrepresentatives of Republic had indicated that Republic would support a transaction with Parent and the\ndocumentation for Parent\u2019s requested waiver was being finalized between Republic and Parent. Representatives\nof BofA Securities also recounted to the Board their discussions with representatives of Party J held on\nOctober 8, 2022 and described above. Next, the Board considered with Company management and advisors\npotential responses to Parent lowering the per share value of its bid. The Board considered with Company\nmanagement and advisors (i) whether Parent\u2019s rationale for the decrease was compelling and (ii) the\neffectiveness of a range of potential responses to Parent, including rejecting the lowered amount and terminating\ndiscussions with Parent, engaging with Parent to negotiate their new price upwards and accepting the lowered\namount. In considering the response to Parent with respect to the revised price, the Board discussed the\nadvanced state of negotiations and documentation with Parent, the uncertainty around the price offered by other\ncompeting bidders, the significant work still necessary for other competing bidders to be ready to enter into a\ndefinitive agreement with respect to a transaction and the fact that engaging Republic with other bidders would\ncreate additional process challenges. Following these discussions and deliberations, the Board directed Mr. Rice\nto explore with Parent the potential for Parent to increase its price above $25.00 per share.\nOn October 12, 2022, Mr. Rice contacted a representative of Parent to convey that a price above $25.00 per\nshare would be necessary for the Board to consider a potential transaction and encouraged representatives of\nParent to increase Parent\u2019s offer price to a price of $26.00 per share. The representative of Parent indicated that\nParent would consider whether Parent could meet the requested increase to $26.00 per share.\nOn October 13, 2022, representatives of Parent contacted Mr. Rice to indicate that, provided that the terms\nof the merger agreement would largely reflect the most recently conveyed positions of Parent, Parent would be\nwilling to agree to a purchase price of $26.00 per share. Mr. Rice agreed to communicate Parent\u2019s $26.00 per share\nposition to the Board and pending such Board discussion, discuss further with Parent.\nLater on the same day, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of each\nof Kirkland and BofA Securities in attendance. Mr. Rice provided the Board with an update on process and price.\nThe Board discussed with Company management and advisors that relative to the other competing bids and\nbased on the analysis provided by BofA Securities, the revised offer from Parent was the most attractive\nalternative, and the Board determined that the Company should move forward with Parent\u2019s increased offer of\n$26.00 per share in cash. Representatives of Kirkland then reviewed with the Board the key terms of the draft\nmerger agreement. Having decided to proceed with the revised price from Parent, the Board discussed whether it\nwas then the appropriate time to authorize certain members of Company management to engage with Parent\u2019s\nrequirement that such members of management execute employment offer letters concurrently with the execution\nof the merger agreement. After discussion with such members of management, including with respect to the use\nof management\u2019s separate counsel at Jones Day to negotiate such arrangements on management\u2019s behalf and\nmanagement\u2019s comfort with the negotiation timeline, the Board authorized management to engage with Parent\nand negotiate and finalize the terms of their employment offer letters with Parent.\nOn October 13, 2022, with the authorization of the Board, Mr. Stork had dinner with representatives of\nParent. During the dinner, the parties discussed how the Company would fit operationally in Parent\u2019s structure,\nassuming agreement with respect to a transaction were to be reached.\nOn October 14, 2022, representatives of Parent contacted each of Messrs. Stork, Walton and McCarthy to\ndiscuss the proposed employment offers and to verbally convey Parent\u2019s compensation proposal.\nBetween October 14, 2022 and October 16, 2022, representatives of each of Parent and management,\nincluding management\u2019s counsel at Jones Day, exchanged drafts of employment offer letters, had several phone\ncalls and corresponded by email to discuss those drafts.\nDuring the evening of October 16, 2022, representatives of each of Parent and Company management\nfinalized the key terms of the employment offer letters. The Board then met with members of Company\nmanagement and representatives of each of BofA Securities and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of\nKirkland reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties. Mr. Rice confirmed to the Board that the Republic\nwaiver and the key terms of the employment offer letters, which were customary and typical, were in final form.\nRepresentatives of Kirkland then provided the Board with an update on the terms of the draft merger agreement.\nThe Board then\n38\nTable of Contents\nreviewed the relationship disclosure letter provided by BofA Securities and concluded that none of information\nprovided by BofA Securities would impact the ability of BofA Securities to act as financial advisor to the\nCompany. At the request of the Board, representatives of BofA Securities reviewed with the Board its financial\nanalysis of the merger consideration and delivered to the Board an oral opinion, which was subsequently\nconfirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated as of October 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of the\nwritten opinion and based upon and subject to the various assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the\nmerger consideration to be received by holders of Company Class A Common Stock (other than Owned\nCompany Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following further discussion of\npotential factors in favor of and against the potential transaction, the Board unanimously (i) determined that it\nwas in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger\nAgreement and consummate the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the\nMerger Agreement and the Voting Agreement, the Warrant Agreement Amendment, the Opco LLC Agreement\nAmendment and the Unitholder Representative Engagement Letter\u037e (ii) approved the execution and delivery of\nthe merger agreement by the Company and OpCo, the performance by the Company and OpCo of their\ncovenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Transactions upon\nthe terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Voting Agreement, the Warrant Agreement Amendment, the\nOpco LLC Agreement Amendment and the Unitholder Representative Engagement Letter\u037e (iii) determined that\nthe Voting Agreement and the Warrant Agreement Amendment are advisable and in the best interests of the\nCompany and its stockholders and approved the Voting Agreement and Warrant Agreement Amendment so that\nthe restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar laws are not\napplicable to the merger agreement\u037e (iv) approved the Opco LLC Agreement Amendment and the Unitholder\nRepresentative Engagement Letter\u037e (v) resolved to recommend that the Company stockholders adopt the Merger\nAgreement in accordance with the DGCL\u037e and (vi) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be\nsubmitted for consideration by the Company stockholders at a meeting thereof and approved the inclusion of\nthe board recommendation in this Proxy Statement.\nLater that evening, Republic, the Company and Parent executed and delivered the documentation\nproviding for the waiver of Republic\u2019s change in control rights that would have otherwise been triggered by the\nclosing of the Merger Agreement with Parent. Thereafter, the parties executed the Merger Agreement, Voting\nAgreement, Conditional Offer Letters and other transaction documents.\nEarly on October 17, 2022, Parent and the Company each issued press releases announcing the\ntransaction.\nReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Archaea Board",

Merger Agreement, and to recommend that the Company\u2019s\nstockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the Board considered the following positive reasons to support the\nMerger Agreement:\n\u2022\n        \nthe fact that the price of $26.00 per share in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate\nvalue and liquidity to the Company\u2019s stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nthe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Class A\ncommon stock, including the fact that the $26.00 per share to be received by the Company\u2019s\nstockholders in the Merger represents:\n\u2022\n        \na premium of approximately 54% over the closing price per share of Class A common stock as\nof October 14, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\n        \na premium of approximately 38% over the volume weighted average price per share of Class A\ncommon stock for the 30 trading days ending October 14, 2022, the last full trading day prior to\nthe announcement of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\n        \na premium of approximately 40% over the volume weighted average price per share of Class A\ncommon stock for the 60 trading days ending October 14, 2022, the last full trading day prior to\nthe announcement of the Merger\u037e and\n\u2022\n        \na premium of approximately 47% over the volume weighted average price per share of Class A\ncommon stock for the 90 trading days ending October 14, 2022, the last full trading day prior to\nthe announcement of the Merger.\n\u2022\n        \nthe belief that the $26.00 per share in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from\nother alternatives reasonably available to the Company, based upon the directors\u2019 extensive\nknowledge of the Company\u2019s business, assets, financial condition and results of operations, the\nchallenges to raising development financing in the current macro-economic market, the Company\u2019s\nhistorical and projected financial performance, and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger\nrepresented an attractive and comparatively certain value for the Company\u2019s stockholders relative to\nthe risk-adjusted prospects for the Company on a standalone basis\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nthe belief that the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing the Company\u2019s\nstockholders associated with possible strategic alternatives to the Merger (including scenarios\ninvolving the possibility of remaining a standalone publicly traded company and other strategic\nalternatives that might be pursued as a standalone public company) were less favorable to the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders, taking into account the timing, risks and likelihood of accomplishing such\nalternatives, and further taking into account the Board\u2019s belief that there were likely no other\npotential purchasers that would be reasonably likely to engage in a transaction in the near term at a\nprice greater than the price being offered by

the\noutstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, and who will receive\nthe same consideration as the Company\u2019s other stockholders, are supportive of the

from the $25.00\nper share communicated by Parent on October 11, 2022, and the Board\u2019s belief, after concluding the\ncompetitive bid process and extensive discussions with Parent, that the merger consideration of\n$26.00 per share represented the best price reasonably available for the Company and which Parent\nwas willing to pay\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nthe fact that the Board conducted a competitive, multi-round process, involving 11 potential buyers,\nbringing seven under confidentiality agreements, and ultimately receiving five indications of\ninterest\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nthe belief that, if the Company did not enter into the Merger Agreement with Parent, there could be a\nconsiderable period of time before the trading price per share of the Company\u2019s Class A

of the Board to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties in\ncertain circumstances, and to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal upon\npayment of a

BofA Securities also assumed, at the\ndirection of the Company, that the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from\nthe Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Securities.\nBofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the\nMerger (other than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without\nlimitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any related transaction or any other agreement, arrangement or\nunderstanding entered into in connection with or related to the Merger or otherwise. BofA Securities\u2019 opinion\nwas limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by holders\nof Class A common stock (other than Owned Company Shares) and no opinion or view was expressed with\nrespect to any consideration received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities,\ncreditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the\nfairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the\nofficers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger\nConsideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the\nMerger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the\nCompany might engage or as to the underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with or effect the\nMerger. BofA Securities did not express any view or opinion with respect to, and relied, with the Company\u2019s\nconsent, upon the assessments of the Company and its representatives regarding legal, regulatory, accounting,\ntax and similar matters relating to the Company or the Merger (including the contemplated benefits thereof), as to\nwhich matters BofA Securities understood that the Company had obtained such advice as the Company deemed\nnecessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or recommendation as\nto how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other matter. Except as\ndescribed in this summary, the Company imposed no other limitations on the investigations made or procedures\nfollowed by BofA Securities in rendering its opinion.\n44\nTable of Contents\nBofA Securities\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other\nconditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Securities as of, the\ndate of its opinion. BofA Securities noted that the credit, financial and stock markets had been experiencing\nunusual volatility and BofA Securities expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility\non the Company, Parent or the Merger. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect its\nopinion, and BofA Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance\nof BofA Securities\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities.\nThe discussion set forth below in the section entitled \u201c\u2014 Archaea Financial Analyses\u201d represents a brief\nsummary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Board in connection with its\nopinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to\nfully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities, the tables must be read together with the\ntext of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses\nperformed by BofA Securities. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full\nnarrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the\nanalyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities.\nArchaea Financial Analyses\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.\n    \nBofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and\nstock market information for the Company and Ameresco, Inc. (\u201cAmeresco\u201d), a publicly traded company in the\nrenewable natural gas industry. In BofA Securities\u2019 view, based on its professional judgment and experience,\nAmeresco was the publicly traded company with business, regulatory and cash flow characteristics most similar\nto those of the Company. BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the enterprise value of Ameresco,\ncalculated as its market value based on its closing stock price on October 14, 2022 and the number of its diluted\nshares outstanding using the treasury stock method, plus debt, preferred stock, non-controlling interests and\nless cash and cash equivalents, short-term liquid investments and long-term liquid investments, as a multiple of\ncalendar year 2023 and 2024 EBITDA (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201c\u2014 Certain\nFinancial Projections\u201d), as set forth in the table below. Estimated financial data of Ameresco was based on\npublicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates.\n \nEnterprise Value/Estimated EBITDA\n \n \n2023E\n \n2024E\nAmeresco, Inc.\n \n17.4x \n14.3x\nBased on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied a range of calendar year 2023\nand 2024 EBITDA multiples of 11.2x to 17.4x and 8.3x to 14.3x, respectively, derived from Ameresco and the\nCompany\u2019s trading history, to the Company\u2019s calendar year 2023 and 2024 EBITDA of $285 million and\n$346 million, respectively, as set forth in the Company Forecasts, to calculate ranges of implied enterprise values\nfor the Company.\nThis analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share value reference ranges for the\nCompany, as compared to the Merger Consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Ranges for the Company\n Merger Consideration\n2023 Estimated EBITDA\n \n2024 Estimated EBITDA\n  \n$20.45 \u2013 $34.51\n \n$17.86 \u2013 $34.35\n $\n26.00\nNo company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to the Company. Accordingly, an\nevaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors\nthat could affect the public trading or other values of any company to which the Company was compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis.\n    \nBofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the\nCompany to calculate the estimated present value of the standalone Unlevered Free Cash Flows (as defined in\nthe section of this proxy statement titled \u201c\u2014 Certain Financial Projections\u201d) that the Company was forecasted to\ngenerate during the Company\u2019s calendar years 2023 through 2032 based on the September Forecasts (as defined\nin the section of this proxy statement titled \u201c\u2014 Certain Financial Projections\u201d). BofA Securities calculated\n45\nTable of Contents\nterminal values for the Company by applying a perpetuity growth rate of 4.0% to 5.0%, based on BofA Securities\u2019\nprofessional judgement and experience, to the Company\u2019s projected standalone Unlevered Free Cash Flows in\nthe terminal year of $632 million, which was obtained by extrapolating the Company\u2019s 2032 projected standalone\nUnlevered Free Cash Flows of $833 million at an assumed growth rate of 4.5%, as provided by the management\nof the Company. BofA Securities subtracted, from the range of terminal values, net debt of $624 million as of\nOctober 7, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company. The cash flows and terminal values were then\ndiscounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 10.75% to 13.25%, which\nwere based on an estimate of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, which was calculated by\nmultiplying the estimated cost of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight, and then adding\nthe products together. The estimated cost of equity was obtained using the capital asset pricing model (which\ntakes into account the risk-free rate, the levered beta and the applicable equity market risk premium) and the\nestimated cost of debt was based on the Company\u2019s estimated borrowing cost. The number of fully-diluted\nshares outstanding was 125.9 million as of October 13, 2022, based on information provided by the management\nof the Company. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference\nranges for the Company as compared to the Merger Consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range for the Company\n Merger Consideration\n$20.66 \u2013 $39.43\n $\n26.00\nOther Factors\nBofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities\u2019\nmaterial financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including,\namong other things, the following:\n\u2022\n        \nhistorical trading prices and trading volumes of the Class A common stock, which indicated low and\nhigh closing prices for Class A common stock during the 52-week period ended October 14, 2022 of\napproximately $13.12 to $23.75 per share\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nprice targets for the Class A common stock in publicly available research analyst reports, which\nindicated stock price targets for the Company of a range of approximately $25.00 to $35.00 per share\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nestimated net asset value per share of Class A common stock, provided by the management of the\nCompany, of approximately $18.21 to $27.59 per share\u037e and\n\u2022\n        \na take-private analysis provided for illustrative purposes to determine an implied price per share of\nClass A common stock that could hypothetically be paid by a private buyer based on certain\nassumptions, including, among others (i) a target levered internal rate of return, referred to as IRR,\nfor the private buyer of 13.0% to 17.0%, (ii) a $300 million term loan (exclusive of existing net debt)\ndue on December 31, 2032, which will be refinanced at 3.0x leverage on December 31, 2029 then\nretired on December 31, 2032, is used to fund some of the purchase, (iii) an exit on December 31, 2032\nat a multiple of the Company\u2019s latest 12 months EBITDA of 8.0x, (iv) a promote of 5% for employee\ncompensation and (v) 2% transaction fees and expenses paid on entry and exit. This analysis\nindicated an implied per share equity value for the Company of a range of approximately $17.38 to\n$31.91.\nMiscellaneous\nAs noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled \u201c\u2014 Archaea Financial Analyses\u201d\nrepresents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Board in\nconnection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or the factors\nconsidered by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex\nanalytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial\nanalysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion\nis not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses\nsummarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its\nanalyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering\nall analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view\nof the\n46\nTable of Contents\nprocesses underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been\nreferred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any\nother analysis referred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and\neconomic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. The estimates of\nthe future performance of the Company in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative\nof actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates\nor those suggested by BofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA\nSecurities\u2019 analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration and were provided\nto the Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The analyses do not purport to be\nappraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities\nhave traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of\nvaluations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial\nuncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities\u2019 view of the actual values of the Company.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations\nbetween the Company and Parent, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board. The\ndecision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board. As described above, BofA Securities\u2019\nopinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the proposed\nMerger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or the Company\u2019s management with\nrespect to the Merger or the Merger Consideration.\nThe Company has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an\naggregate fee of approximately $29.0 million, $2.5 million of which was payable upon the delivery of its opinion\nand the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, at the sole\ndiscretion of the Company, a discretionary fee of approximately $4.1 million may be payable to BofA Securities.\nThe Company also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA\nSecurities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of\ntheir respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including\nliabilities under the federal securities laws.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in\nsecurities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal\ninvesting as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management,\nfinancing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of\ncompanies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its\naffiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold\nlong or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in equity, debt or other\nsecurities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of (i) the Company and\ncertain of its affiliates, and (ii) Parent and certain of its affiliates.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may\nprovide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to the Company and have received\nor in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting\nas a lender under a credit facility of an affiliate of the Company and (ii) having acted as a co-manager to the\nCompany on an equity follow-on offering. From October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2022, BofA Securities and\nits affiliates derived aggregate revenues from the Company and certain of its affiliates of approximately\n$1.2 million for investment and corporate banking services.\nIn addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the\nfuture may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Parent and have\nreceived or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted\nor acting as a financial advisor to an affiliate of Parent in an acquisition and in a sale of a minority stake in a\npipeline, (ii) having acted or acting as an active bookrunner in a bond offering, (iii) having acted or acting as\nadministrative agent, co-lead arranger, joint bookrunner for, and a lender under, certain credit facilities of Parent\nor certain of its affiliates, (iv) having provided or providing certain treasury services and products to Parent and\ncertain of its affiliates, and (v) having provided or providing certain commodity, derivatives and foreign exchange\ntrading services\n47\nTable of Contents\nto Parent and certain of its affiliates. From October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2022, BofA Securities and its\naffiliates derived aggregate revenues of approximately $92 million from investment banking, corporate banking\nand global markets services furnished to Parent and its affiliates.",

            "text": "Certain Financial Projections\nThe Company does not, as a matter of general practice, prepare or publicly disclose long-range financial\nforecasts due to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future\nperiods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized. However, in\nconnection with the Board\u2019s evaluation of strategic alternatives, in July 2022, the Company, at the request of the\nBoard, provided to the Board and BofA Securities with certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial\ninformation prepared by Company management for the fiscal years ending 2023 through 2032 reflecting what the\nCompany\u2019s management believed were the best then-available estimates and judgments of future financial\nperformance of the Company for such periods (the \u201cJuly Forecasts\u201d). The July Forecasts were reviewed by the\nBoard on July 24, 2022. In addition, at the request of the Board, a version of the July Forecasts with minor\nupdates by Company management to reflect more current information and expectations regarding federal income\ntax assumptions was made available in August 2022 to Parent and certain other parties in connection with their\ndue diligence of a possible transaction with the Company. On and after September 14, 2022, the Company, at the\nrequest of the Board, provided the Board, BofA Securities, Parent and certain other parties in connection with\ntheir due diligence of a possible transaction, as applicable, with updated, non-public, unaudited prospective\nfinancial information prepared for the fiscal years ending 2023 through 2032 in order to reflect more current\ninformation and expectations regarding, among other things, (i) contracted portfolio assumptions, (ii) royalty\npayment assumptions, (iii) certain joint venture project assumptions, (iv) amortization payment schedules for the\nCompany\u2019s indebtedness and (v) completion of delivery dates for certain projects and end dates for certain gas\nrights agreements. This updated prospective financial information (the \u201cSeptember Forecasts\u201d) was also\nprovided to (a) BofA Securities for its use and reliance as the basis for the financial valuation analyses\nconducted by BofA Securities and opinion summarized in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201c\u2014 Opinion\nof the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d and (b) the Board in its review of, and in connection with approving, the\nMerger Agreement and the Merger.\nThe July Forecasts and the September Forecasts (together, the \u201cForecasts\u201d) were prepared by Company\nmanagement at the direction of the Company Board. The Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public\ndisclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC or established by\nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial\ninformation or generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Company\u2019s independent registered\npublic accounting firm has not compiled, examined, audited or performed any procedures with respect to the\nForecasts, and has not expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance regarding this information or its\nachievability.\nThe tables below present summaries of the Forecasts, as prepared by Company management and provided\nby Company management to the Board, BofA Securities, Parent and/or certain other parties in connection with\nthe proposed Merger, as applicable. The Forecasts summarized below are included solely to provide the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders access to financial projections that were made available to the Company, BofA\nSecurities, Parent and/or certain other parties in connection with the proposed Merger, as applicable, and are not\nincluded in this proxy statement to influence a Company stockholder\u2019s decision whether to vote to adopt the\nMerger Agreement or for any other purpose.\nThe Forecasts summarized below, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous\nvariables and assumptions that necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future\neconomic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to\npredict and many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Forecasts also reflect assumptions that are\nsubject to change, including, but not limited to, assumptions regarding: future industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, regulatory, litigation, market and financial conditions, and matters specific to the Company\u2019s\nbusiness. The Forecasts cover multiple years, and thus, by their nature, they become subject to greater\nuncertainty with each successive year. Important factors that may affect actual results and the achievability of\nthe Forecasts include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial, debt,\ncapital, credit or securities markets\u037e industry and market dynamics\u037e competition\u037e and those risks and\nuncertainties described in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2021 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. See also the section\ntitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this proxy statement.\n48Table of Contents\nIn addition, the Forecasts reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple\ninterpretations based on actual results, revised prospects for the Company\u2019s business, changes in general\nbusiness or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that\nwas not anticipated when the Forecasts were prepared. Accordingly, actual results will differ, and may differ\nmaterially, from those contained in the Forecasts. The Forecasts assume organic company growth, inclusive of\nthe development of existing joint development project pipelines without business expansions from mergers and\nacquisitions. The Forecasts also include assumptions regarding future landfill expansion and existing INGENCO\nand Lightning Joint Venture projects, assumptions regarding future opportunities through the Lightning Joint\nVenture with no current developers and assumptions regarding future gas rights agreements expected to be\ncompleted, but not yet agreed. The Forecasts do not include potential earnings relating to hydrogen, CO2, heat\nand LFG collection efficiency improvements. In addition, the Forecasts do not take into account any\ncircumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the Forecasts were prepared and do not\ngive effect to any changes or expenses incurred after the date on which they were made, including as a result of\nthe Merger or any effects of the Merger. The Company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the\nForecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date on which the Forecasts were prepared or to reflect the\noccurrence of future events, even if any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. There can\nbe no assurance that the financial results in the Forecasts will be realized, or that future actual financial results\nwill not materially vary from those estimated in the Forecasts.\nCertain of the measures included in the Forecasts are financial measures that are not calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nFurthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and\ncredits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, non-GAAP financial measures\nshould be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with\nGAAP. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the SEC\u2019s rules concerning non-\nGAAP financial measures and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP\nfinancial measure, in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the\ndisclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures were not prepared or relied upon by the Company Board in connection with its consideration of the\nMerger Agreement or by BofA Securities for purposes of its financial analyses. Accordingly, the Company has\nnot provided a reconciliation of any financial measures included in the Forecasts.\nThe following table is a summary of the July Forecasts:\n($ in millions)\n 2023E  \n2024E  \n2025E  \n2026E  2027E  2028E  2029E  2030E  2031E  \n2032E\nRevenue\n $ 690   $ 804   $ 1,019   $ 1,228   $ 1,656 $ 1,923 $ 2,063 $ 2,184 $ 2,328 $\n2,492\nEBITDA(1)\n $ 309   $ 367   $\n485   $\n603   $\n863 $ 1,024 $ 1,104 $ 1,187 $ 1,272 $\n1,371\nEBIT(2)\n $ 259   $ 304   $\n398   $\n491   $\n715 $\n851 $\n919 $\n990 $ 1,062 $\n1,148\nNet Income\n $ 195   $ 228   $\n306   $\n385   $\n608 $\n564 $\n607 $\n652 $\n697 $\n752\nLevered Free Cash\nFlow(3)\n $ (44)  $ (221)  $ (231)  $ (229)  $\n365 $\n520 $\n573 $\n627 $\n684 $\n750\nUnlevered Free Cash\nFlow(4)\n $\n(7)  $ (176)  $ (178)  $ (168)  $\n415 $\n540 $\n592 $\n646 $\n701 $\n766\n____________\n(1)\n      \nEBITDA is calculated as revenue less asset specific royalty expense, marketing expense, transportation expense,\npower expense, insurance and rent expense, operations and maintenance (\u201cO&M\u201d) expense, reliability and\nmaintenance (\u201cR&M\u201d) expense, asset specific selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expense, contingency\nexpense and corporate SG&A.\n(2)\n      \nEBIT is calculated as EBITDA less depreciation and amortization plus adjustments from the Power segment joint\nventures.\n(3)\n      \nLevered Free Cash Flow is calculated as EBIT less interest, asset specific state taxes, federal taxes, asset specific\nmaintenance capital expenditures, growth projects capital expenditures, and plus depreciation and amortization.\n(4)\n      \nUnlevered Free Cash Flow is calculated as Levered Free Cash Flow plus tax adjusted interest.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables are summaries of the September Forecasts:\n($ in millions)\n 2023E  \n2024E  \n2025E  \n2026E  2027E  2028E  2029E  2030E  2031E  \n2032E\nRevenue\n $ 629   $ 750   $ 975   $ 1,228   $ 1,675 $ 1,954 $ 2,106 $ 2,229 $ 2,379 $\n2,559\nEBITDA(1)\n $ 285   $ 346   $ 467   $\n609   $\n872 $ 1,029 $ 1,113 $ 1,180 $ 1,261 $\n1,362\nEBIT(2)\n $ 236   $ 283   $ 379   $\n498   $\n724 $\n857 $\n928 $\n983 $ 1,051 $\n1,139\nNet Income\n $ 170   $ 205   $ 277   $\n375   $\n595 $\n588 $\n660 $\n702 $\n753 $\n820\nLevered Free Cash\nFlow(3)\n $ (69)  $ (243)  $ (260)  $ (239)  $\n353 $\n544 $\n625 $\n677 $\n740 $\n817\nUnlevered Free Cash\nFlow(4)\n $ (28)  $ (195)  $ (197)  $ (163)  $\n421 $\n584 $\n645 $\n696 $\n757 $\n833\n____________\n(1)\n      \nEBITDA is calculated as revenue less asset specific royalty expense, marketing expense, transportation expense,\npower expense, insurance and rent expense, O&M expense, R&M expense, asset specific SG&A expense,\ncontingency expense and corporate SG&A.\n(2)\n      \nEBIT is calculated as EBITDA less depreciation and amortization plus adjustments from the Power segment joint\nventures.\n(3)\n      \nLevered Free Cash Flow is calculated as EBIT less interest, asset specific state taxes, federal taxes, asset specific\nmaintenance capital expenditures, growth projects capital expenditures, and plus depreciation and amortization.\n(4)\n      \nUnlevered Free Cash Flow is calculated as Levered Free Cash Flow plus tax adjusted interest.\nCertain Effects of the Merger",

As the surviving corporation in the Merger, Archaea will continue to exist following the Merger as a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nFollowing the Merger, all of the Archaea common stock will be beneficially owned by Parent and none of\nthe Company\u2019s current stockholders will have any direct ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the\nCompany, the Surviving Corporation or Parent after the consummation of the Merger. As a result, the Company\u2019s\ncurrent stockholders will no longer have the potential to benefit from any increase in the value, nor will they bear\nthe risk of any decrease in the value, of Archaea common stock. Following the Merger, Parent will have the\npotential to benefit from any increase in the Company\u2019s value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in the\nCompany\u2019s value.\nAt the Effective Time, and without any action by any Archaea stockholder, each share of Class A common\nstock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Owned\nCompany Shares or any Dissenting Company Shares), will be automatically canceled, extinguished and\nconverted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nAlso, at the Effective Time, and without any action by any Archaea stockholder, each share of Class B\ncommon stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically\ncanceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor. Each holder of Class B\ncommon stock also holds an equivalent number of Opco Units.\nAlso, at the Effective Time, and without any action by any Archaea stockholder, (i) each share of common\nstock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be\nautomatically canceled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common\nstock of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) each of the Owned Company Shares will automatically be canceled\nand extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.\nAt the Opco Merger Effective Time, and without any action by any holder of Opco Units, each Opco Unit\nheld by a holder other than the Specified Opco Holders issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the\nOpco Merger Effective Time will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive\ncash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nAlso, at the Opco Merger Effective Time, and without any action by any holder of Opco Units, (i) the\nOwned Opco Units shall become an equivalent number of limited liability company interests of the Surviving\nOpco held by the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) all limited liability company interests of Opco Merger Sub will\nautomatically be canceled, extinguished and converted into limited liability company interests of the Surviving\nOpco, such that\n50Table of Contents\nthe aggregate number of limited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco to be held by Parent\nimmediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time will represent the same percentage of the outstanding\nlimited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time\nas the percentage of Opco Units held by the Specified Opco Holders immediately prior to the Opco Merger\nEffective Time. As a result, immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, based on the number of Opco\nUnits issued and outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement, approximately 30.9% of the limited liability\ncompany interests in the Surviving Opco will be held directly by Parent, and approximately 69.1% of the limited\nliability company interests in the Surviving Opco will be held directly by the Company (and accordingly\nindirectly by Parent).\nImmediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, each of the Warrants will be redeemed for cash in\naccordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Warrant Agreement Amendment, which provides\nthat immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, each Warrant that is issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically redeemed for the right to receive an amount, in cash,\nequal to (i) the Merger Consideration minus (ii) the Warrant Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreement and\nwhich is currently $11.50) as reduced pursuant to the calculation provided in Section 4.4 of the Warrant\nAgreement, without interest.\nAt the Effective Time, all Archaea equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective\nTime will generally be afforded the treatment described in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement \u2014 Treatment of Equity-Based Awards in the Merger.\u201d\nClass A common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on the NYSE under the\nticker symbol \u201cLFG.\u201d Following the consummation of the Merger, shares of Class A common stock will be\ndelisted from the NYSE. In addition, the registration of shares of Class A common stock under the Exchange Act\nwill be terminated, and the Company will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC\nwith respect to its Class A common stock. Termination of registration of Class A common stock under the\nExchange Act will make provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file annual and quarterly\nreports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of\nSection 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with\nstockholders\u2019 meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer applicable to the Company.\nEffects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed",

As of the date of this proxy statement, Archaea has\nnot yet approved any specific actions to mitigate any impact of Section 280G of the Code on Archaea or any\ndisqualified individuals. As of the date of this proxy statement, no executive officer is entitled to receive gross-\nups or tax reimbursements from Archaea with respect to any potential excise taxes.\nArchaea Non-Employee Director Compensation\nUnder the Merger Agreement, Archaea may continue to pay non-employee members of the Board their\nannual fees, retainers, equity grants, reimbursements and stipends, in each case, in accordance with the terms of\nthe Director Compensation Policy. As described above in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201c\u2014 Interests\nof the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d all RSUs held by non-employee directors will\nbe paid out to the non-employee directors in cash at the per share price in connection with the closing of the\nMerger.\nFuture Arrangements\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, none of Archaea\u2019s directors or executive officers has entered into\nany agreement, arrangement or understanding with Parent regarding employment or service with, or\ncompensation following the Merger to be paid by, Parent, except that, concurrently with Parent\u2019s and Archaea\u2019s\nexecution of the Merger Agreement, Messrs. Stork, Walton and McCarthy were required to enter into customary\n\u201cat-will\u201d employment offer letters with BP America Production Company Inc. (\u201cBP\u201d), which will become effective\nupon consummation of the Merger and are described below (the \u201cConditional Offer Letters\u201d). In addition, prior\nto the closing of the Merger, other directors or executive officers of Archaea may discuss or enter into\nagreements, arrangements or understandings with Parent regarding employment or service with, or\ncompensation following the Merger, to be paid by Parent.\nOn October 16, 2022, as a condition to Parent\u2019s execution of the Merger Agreement, BP entered into the\nConditional Offer Letters with each of Messrs. Stork, Walton and McCarthy. The Conditional Offer Letters\nprovide that upon and subject to the closing of the Merger, Mr. Stork will become Chief Executive Officer of BP\nUS BioGas, Mr. Walton will become Chief Development Officer of BP US BioGas, and Mr. McCarthy will become\nChief Commercial Officer of BP US BioGas.\nIn recognition of their future services to BP, the Conditional Offer Letters provide that Messrs. Stork,\nWalton and McCarthy will receive compensation for each of calendar years 2023 and 2024 in an amount not less\nthan their existing total target compensation with Archaea (base salary, target annual bonus opportunity, and\ntarget long term incentive opportunity) of $3,500,000 for Mr. Stork, $2,000,000 for Mr. Walton and $2,550,000 for\nMr. McCarthy. In the event that the actual compensation received by each of Messrs. Stork, Walton and\nMcCarthy in 2023 and 2024 is less than their respective minimum compensation amounts set forth above, BP has\nagreed to grant each of them restricted stock units in the amount of such shortfall that will vest on March 31,\n2025 for the 2023 calendar year compensation and March 31, 2026 for the 2024 calendar year compensation,\nsubject to continued employment through such vesting dates. Notwithstanding the above, the Conditional Offer\nLetters do not guarantee any amount of compensation, nor do they guarantee continued, or initial, employment\nat BP.\nSubject to the commencement of their employment with BP, the Conditional Offer Letters require each of\nMessrs. Stork, Walton and McCarthy to be bound by certain restrictive covenants for a period of 18 months\nafter the termination of their employment in addition to a 6-month notice period.\n56\nTable of Contents\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Archaea\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled\nto certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies.

        "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations": {
            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to\nholders of Class A common stock who receive cash in exchange for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to\nthe Merger. This discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential\ntax consequences of the Merger. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the U.S. Treasury\nRegulations promulgated thereunder and judicial decisions and administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the\ndate of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements set\nforth herein. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d) regarding any of the tax issues discussed herein. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not\nchallenge one or more of the tax consequences of the Merger described in this proxy statement.\nThis discussion assumes that holders of Class A common stock hold their shares as \u201ccapital assets\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does\nnot address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder of Class A\ncommon stock in light of such holder\u2019s individual circumstances, nor does it address U.S. state or local, non-\nU.S., or estate or gift taxes, the alternative minimum tax, the rules regarding qualified small business stock within\nthe meaning of Section 1202 of the Code, the Medicare tax on net investment income or any other aspect of any\nU.S. federal tax other than the income tax. This discussion also does not address tax considerations that may be\nrelevant to holders of Class A common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws,\nsuch as, for example, financial institutions, brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, mutual funds,\npartnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or\nother pass-through entities and their partners or members, S corporations, tax-exempt organizations,\ngovernmental organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, traders in securities\nwho elect mark-to-market method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment\ncompanies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, U.S. expatriates and former\ncitizens or long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired their Class A common stock as\ncompensation, holders who hold their Class A common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale,\nconversion transaction, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, real\nestate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, holders deemed to sell their shares of Class A\ncommon stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code, persons who own (directly, indirectly or\nconstructively) an equity interest in Parent or the Surviving Corporation, holders who own both shares of\nClass A common stock and Opco Units and holders who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger\nunder the DGCL.\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Class A\ncommon stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the\npartner and activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership holding Class A common stock\nor a partner of a partnership holding Class A common stock, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger relevant to you.\nThis discussion is general in nature and is not tax advice. Holders of Class A common stock are urged to\nconsult their tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them in\nlight of their particular circumstances, as well as any tax consequences of the Merger arising under the\nU.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws or under any\nstate, local or non-U.S. tax laws or under any applicable income tax treaty.\n57Table of Contents\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Class A common stock\nthat, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:\n\u2022\n        \nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\n        \na corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)\ncreated or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof\u037e\n\u2022\n        \na trust if (i) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States\nand one or more U.S. persons as described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code have the authority to\ncontrol all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable\nU.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person (within the meaning of the Code)\u037e\nand\n\u2022\n        \nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Class A common stock\nthat is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, a corporation, a trust or an estate that is not a\nU.S. holder.\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally\nbe a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received\npursuant to the Merger (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and such\nU.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in a share of Class A common stock will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid\nfor such share. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if\nthe U.S. holder\u2019s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the closing. Long-term capital\ngains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for a reduced rate of\nU.S. federal income taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss must be\ncalculated separately for each block of Class A common stock (i.e., common stock acquired at the same time and\nat the same price in a single transaction). U.S. holders who own separate blocks of Class A common stock are\nurged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these rules.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nAny gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the Merger by a non-U.S. holder will generally not\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\n        \nthe gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of such non-\nU.S. holder (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent\nestablishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such\nnon-U.S. holder), in which case the non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to tax on such gain in\nthe same manner as a U.S. holder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such\ncorporation may be subject to branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be\nspecified by an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nthe non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days\nor more in the taxable year of the Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-\nU.S. holder will generally be subject to a 30% tax (or tax at such lower rate as may be specified under\nan applicable income tax treaty) on the non-U.S. holder\u2019s net gain realized for the year\u037e or\n\u2022\n        \nthe Company is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes at any time during the shorter of (i) the five-year period ending on the date of\nthe Merger and (ii) the non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the Class A common stock, and, in the\ncase where the Class A common stock is traded on an established securities market, at any time\nduring such period, the non-U.S. holder owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5%\nof the outstanding Class A common stock, in which case gain recognized by the non-U.S. holder\n58\nTable of Contents\nin the Merger will generally be subject to tax at applicable U.S. federal income tax rates as if the non-\nU.S. holder was a U.S. holder. Generally, a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation\nonly if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the\nfair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a\ntrade or business.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nProceeds received in connection with the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and\nU.S. backup withholding. Backup withholding will generally not apply, however, to a U.S. holder who furnishes a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and makes other required certifications, or who is otherwise exempt from\nbackup withholding and establishes such exempt status (generally, by providing a valid IRS Form W-9). A non-\nU.S. holder will generally eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by\nproviding certification of its foreign status, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS\nForm W-8 or by otherwise establishing an exemption.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited\nagainst a holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, and a holder may generally claim a refund of any excess\namounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the\nIRS and furnishing any required information.\nFATCA\nProvisions of the Code (Sections 1471 through 1474) commonly referred to as \u201cFATCA\u201d impose\nwithholding of 30% on payments of dividends (including constructive dividends) on Archaea common stock.\nFATCA withholding under FATCA was scheduled to apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale of\nproperty that produces U.S.-source interest or dividends beginning on January 1, 2019, but on December 13,\n2018, the IRS released proposed regulations that, if finalized in their proposed form, would eliminate the\nobligation to withhold on gross proceeds. Although these proposed Treasury Regulations are not final,\ntaxpayers may generally rely on them until final Treasury Regulations are issued.\nIn general, no FATCA withholding will be required with respect to a U.S. holder or an individual non-\nU.S. holder that timely provides the certifications required on a valid IRS Form W-9 or W-8BEN, respectively.\nHolders potentially subject to withholding include \u201cforeign financial institutions\u201d (which is broadly defined for\nthis purpose and generally includes investment vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless various\nU.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of\ninterests in, or accounts with, those entities) have been satisfied, or an exemption applies (typically certified by\nthe delivery of a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E). If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner\nthat is not a foreign financial institution will generally be entitled to a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a\nU.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant administrative burden). Non-U.S. holders that are\nresident in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may\nbe subject to different rules. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of\nFATCA to them.\nTHE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR\nDESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE\nMERGER. THIS SUMMARY IS GENERAL IN NATURE AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. IN ADDITION, THIS\nDISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE\nCONTINGENT ON, A HOLDER\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, EACH HOLDER IS\nURGED TO CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF\nTHE MERGER TO SUCH HOLDER IN LIGHT OF SUCH HOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES,\nINCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES WITH RESPECT TO ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY STATE,\nLOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.\n59\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

These rights are known as appraisal rights. Stockholders and beneficial owners electing\nto exercise appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their\nrights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures is required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.\nThis section is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of Delaware law pertaining to\nappraisal rights. The following discussion, however, is not a complete summary of the law pertaining to appraisal\nrights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is accessible\nat the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and\nincorporated by reference herein. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and this section to \u201cstockholder\u201d are\nto the record holder of the shares of Archaea common stock, and all references in Section 262 of the DGCL and\nthis section to \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d are a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of stock held either in\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in\nSection 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. The following discussion does not constitute\nany legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not an Archaea stockholder\nor beneficial owner should exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nSubject to certain exceptions specified in Section 262 of the DGCL and summarized below, holders of\nshares of Archaea common stock who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of their shares to the Company\nprior to the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement\u037e (iii) continuously own such shares through the Effective Time\u037e and (iv) otherwise comply\nwith the applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have\ntheir shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of\nsuch shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from\nthe accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) as of the completion of the Merger instead of the Merger\nConsideration. Any such Archaea stockholder or beneficial owner awarded \u201cfair value\u201d for his, her or its shares\nby the court would receive payment of that fair value in cash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to\nreceive the Merger Consideration. It is possible that any such \u201cfair value\u201d as determined by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, that which Archaea stockholders will receive pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement.\nSection 262 of the DGCL requires that stockholders as of the record date for notice of the Special Meeting\nto vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less\nthan 20 days before the Special Meeting. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL, or information directing the\nstockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed\nwithout subscription or cost, must be included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to\nthe Company\u2019s stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in connection with the Merger in\ncompliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of the applicable statutory\nprovisions is accessible at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.\nStockholders and beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights or who wish to preserve the\nright to do so should review the following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully. Failure\nto comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner will result in the\nloss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in\nrespect of the Company unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the persons seeking\nappraisal. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal,\nstockholders and beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their own\nlegal and financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. An Archaea\nstockholder or beneficial owner who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the\nMerger Consideration.\n89Table of Contents\nHow to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights",

This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and\nseparate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement. Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does\nnot constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. If you are a\nholder of record of shares of Archaea, your written demand must reasonably inform us of the\nidentity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of his, her or its\nshares. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Archaea, your written demand must (i) reasonably\nidentify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made\u037e (ii) provide documentary\nevidence of your beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and\ncorrect copy of what it purports to be and (iii) provide an address at which such beneficial owner\nconsents to receive notices given by the Company and the office of Register in Chancery\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nYour failure to make a written demand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is\ntaken will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nYou must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A\nvote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, by proxy submitted by mail, over the Internet\nor by telephone, will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted\nand will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A proxy which does not contain\nvoting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.\nTherefore, a stockholder or beneficial owner who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights must instruct the proxy to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or\nabstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nYou must continuously own your shares of Archaea common stock from the date of making the\ndemand through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer the shares\nbefore the Effective Time\u037e\n\u2022\n        \nAny person who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, and who is\notherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the Company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the\nEffective Time. The Company is under no obligation to file any petition and has no present intention\nof doing so\u037e and\n\u2022\n        \nYou must otherwise comply with the applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262\nof the DGCL.\nIf you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to\nreceive the Merger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Archaea\ncommon stock. If you exercise your appraisal rights, you will receive no payment of the Merger Consideration\nunless you withdraw or otherwise lose your demand for appraisal.\nIn addition, because the Class A common stock is listed on a national securities exchange and is expected\nto continue to be listed on such exchange immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares of Class A common stock, unless (i) the\ntotal number of shares of Class A common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of\nClass A common stock eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such\ntotal number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million. We refer to conditions (i) and (ii) as the\n\u201cownership thresholds.\u201d At least one of the ownership thresholds must be met in order for the Company\u2019s\nstockholders or beneficial owners to be entitled to seek appraisal with respect to such shares of Class A common\nstock.\n90Table of Contents\nVoting, via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or\nfailing to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as\nrequired by Section 262 of the DGCL.

In that case, the written demand should state the number of\nshares of common stock as to which appraisal is sought.

In addition, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed\nas to any stockholder or beneficial owner without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, which\napproval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that\nthis provision will not affect the right of any Archaea stockholder or beneficial owner that has made an appraisal\ndemand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to\nwithdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in\nthe Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, either a record holder\nor a beneficial owner of Archaea common stock, provided such person has complied with the requirements of\nSection 262 of the DGCL and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the Surviving Corporation must\ncommence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on\nthe Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder or beneficial owner, demanding an\nappraisal of the value of the shares of Archaea common stock held by all stockholders and beneficial owners\nwho have properly demanded appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file an appraisal\npetition and has no present intention of doing so. If you desire to have your shares appraised, you should\ninitiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the\nmanner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder or beneficial owner who has complied with the\nprovisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation, upon written\nrequest, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Archaea common stock not voted in favor\nof the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Archaea has received demands for\nappraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this\nstatement to you within the later of (i) 10 days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the request therefor\nor (ii) 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner\nof shares of common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee or intermediary on your behalf, you may, in\nyour own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in\nthis paragraph.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record or beneficial owner of Archaea\ncommon stock who has properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 262 of the DGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving\nCorporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file in the\noffice of the Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have\ndemanded appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been\nreached by the Surviving Corporation. At the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndetermine which persons have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and have become\nentitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders demanding appraisal\nwho hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of\nthe pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as\nto any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. The Delaware Court of Chancery will also dismiss\nproceedings as to all persons if neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met. Where proceedings\nare not dismissed or the demand for appraisal is not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value of the\nshares of Archaea common stock at the Effective Time held by all persons who have properly perfected appraisal\nrights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together\nwith interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Delaware Court of\nChancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through\nthe date of payment of the judgment will be compounded\n92Table of Contents\nquarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established\nfrom time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment.\nHowever, the Surviving Corporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry\nof judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each person entitled to appraisal. If the\nSurviving Corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL,\ninterest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the\nSurviving Corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery and (ii) interest accrued on the amount of the voluntary cash payment before such\npayment was made, unless such interest was paid at the time the voluntary cash payment is made. When the fair\nvalue is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, together with interest,\nless any amounts already paid in a voluntary cash payment, to the stockholders and beneficial owners entitled to\nreceive the same, upon such terms and conditions that the Delaware Chancery Court may order.\nIn determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant\nfactors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered\nin determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods\nwhich are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should\nbe considered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of\na company.\u201d\nThe Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other\nfactors which were known, or which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on\nfuture prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive\nof any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not\nencompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising\nfrom such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of\nthe DGCL to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or\nsusceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nYou should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Archaea common stock as determined under\nSection 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value that you are entitled to receive\nunder the terms of the Merger Agreement and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness\nfrom a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in\nany manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nMoreover, neither Archaea nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to anyone\nexercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection\n(h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Archaea common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. No representation is\nmade as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nIf no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time or if neither of the\nownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of such shares, then all Archaea stockholders and\nbeneficial owners will lose the right to an appraisal and will instead receive the Merger Consideration described\nin the Merger Agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate\nthose costs to the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the\ncircumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the list filed by the Surviving Corporation\nwho participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may order all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\nand the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Archaea common\nstock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award\npursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.\n93\nTable of Contents\nIf you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or\nafter the Effective Time, vote the shares subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other\ndistributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of Archaea\ncommon stock as of a record date prior to the Effective Time.\nIf you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you\nmay withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of\nthe demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration to the Surviving Corporation, except\nthat any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the\nSurviving Corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to\nany stockholder or beneficial owner without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may\nbe conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this provision\nwill not affect the right of any person that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw its demand for appraisal and to\naccept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If\nyou fail to perfect, successfully withdraw your demand for appraisal, or lose the appraisal right, your shares of\nArchaea common stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest\nthereon, less any withholding taxes.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in\nthe loss of your appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your\nshares of Archaea common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement without interest. In view of the\ncomplexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are considering exercising your appraisal rights\nunder the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and financial advisor.\nThe process of demanding and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with the prerequisites of\nSection 262 of the DGCL. If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are urged to consult with your own\nlegal and financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. To the extent there\nare any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL will govern.\n94\nTable of Contents\nHOUSEHOLDING",

            "text": "FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS\nIf the Merger is completed, we do not expect to hold a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, as Archaea\nwill cease to be an independent public company and will become a subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is not\ncompleted, you will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in the Company\u2019s annual meetings of\nstockholders, and we will hold a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, in which case we will provide notice of or\notherwise publicly disclose the date on which the 2023 annual meeting will be held.

The submission of a stockholder proposal does not\nguarantee that it will be included in our proxy statement and any submitted stockholder proposal must comply\nwith the requirements of Rule 14a-8.\nOur bylaws include separate advance notice provisions applicable to stockholders desiring to bring\nnominations for directors before an annual stockholders meeting or to bring proposals before an annual\nstockholders meeting other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8. These advance notice provisions require that, among\nother things, stockholders give timely written notice to the Corporate Secretary of Archaea regarding such\nnominations or proposals and provide the information and satisfy the other requirements set forth in our bylaws.\nTo be timely, a stockholder who intends to present nominations or a proposal at the 2023 annual meeting of\nstockholders other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 must provide the information set forth in our bylaws to the\nCorporate Secretary of Archaea no earlier than January 18, 2023 and no later than February 17, 2023. However, if\nwe hold the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders more than 30 days before, or more than 60 days after, the\nanniversary of the date of the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, then the information must be received no\nearlier than the 120th day prior to the date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, and not later than (i) the\n90th day prior to the date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders or (ii) the 10th day after public disclosure of\nthe date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, whichever is later.
