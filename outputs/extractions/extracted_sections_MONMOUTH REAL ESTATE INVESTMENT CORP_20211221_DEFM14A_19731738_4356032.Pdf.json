For a description of these interests, see the information provided in the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of Monmouth\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.\u201d\nRegulatory Matters (see page 58)\nMonmouth is unaware of any material federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required\nfor the completion of the Merger, other than the acceptance for record of the articles of merger by the State\nDepartment of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland and certificate of merger by the Secretary of State of the State\nof Delaware, in each case with respect to the Merger.\nVoting Agreement (see page 58)\nIn connection with the Merger, Mr. Eugene W. Landy, the Chairman of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, and Mr.\nMichael P. Landy, Monmouth\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, have entered into a voting agreement with ILPT\npursuant to which, in their capacity as shareholders, they have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of such\nvoting agreement, to vote their shares of Monmouth Common Stock in favor of the Merger. The shares of Monmouth\nCommon Stock subject to the voting agreement represent approximately 3% of the outstanding voting power of\nMonmouth Common Stock as of the record date for the Special Meeting.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 58)\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties will treat the Merger as a taxable sale by Monmouth of all of\nMonmouth\u2019s assets to ILPT in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the Preferred Stock Consideration, the\nassumption of all of Monmouth\u2019s liabilities and any other applicable amounts, followed immediately by the\ndistribution of such Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock Consideration (and any other applicable amounts) to\nthe holders of equity interests in Monmouth in complete liquidation of Monmouth pursuant to Revenue Ruling 69-6,\n1969-1 C.B. 104, Section 331(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) and Section 562(b)(1) of the Code.\nBecause, as a REIT, Monmouth is entitled to receive a deduction for liquidating distributions, and Monmouth\nanticipates that its deemed liquidating distribution will exceed its taxable income recognized as a result of the Merger\n(together with any other undistributed taxable income recognized in the taxable year of the Merger), Monmouth\nanticipates that it will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger\nand the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nFor further discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.\u201d\nDividends (see page 61)\nThe Merger Agreement permits Monmouth to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends on the outstanding shares of\nMonmouth Common Stock in an amount not exceeding $0.18 per share for each completed quarter until the\nconsummation of the Merger, quarterly cash dividends on its outstanding Monmouth Preferred Stock in an amount\nequal to $0.3828125 per share, and distributions reasonably necessary for Monmouth to maintain its REIT status and\navoid or reduce the imposition of any entity level income or excise tax under the Code (or applicable state law).\nIn the event that Monmouth declares or pays any dividend or other distribution that is reasonably necessary to\nmaintain its REIT status and avoid or reduce the imposition of any entity level income or excise tax under the Code\n(or applicable state law) in excess of the permitted $0.18 per share of Monmouth Common Stock per quarter, such\nexcess amount will reduce the Merger Consideration on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\n5\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDelisting and Deregistration of Monmouth Common Stock and Preferred Stock (see page 61)\nAfter the Merger is completed, the shares of Monmouth Common Stock and Monmouth Preferred Stock currently\nlisted on the NYSE will cease to be listed on the NYSE and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger (see page 62)\nBeginning on December 13, 2021, purported shareholders of Monmouth filed two lawsuits against Monmouth and\nmembers of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, challenging disclosures related to the Merger. The complaints (the\n\u201cComplaints\u201d), Wang v. Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, et al., No. 1:21-cv-10632 (S.D.N.Y.) and\nWhitfield v. Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, et al., No. 1:21-cv-10854 (S.D.N.Y.), allege, among other\nthings, that Monmouth and its directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated\nthereunder and that Monmouth\u2019s directors violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by causing the filing of a proxy\nstatement relating to the Merger with the SEC that misstates or omits certain allegedly material information.\nThe Complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief enjoining the consummation of the Merger, rescission of\nthe Merger to the extent implemented (or rescissory damages), accounting for damages, declaration that Monmouth\nand its directors violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder, and an award of\nthe plaintiff\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees. Monmouth believes that all of the claims asserted in the\nComplaints are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against such actions. However, litigation is inherently\nuncertain and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that the defense of the actions will be successful. If\nthe lawsuits are successful, they could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in costs to Monmouth.\nAdditional lawsuits relating to the Merger may also be filed in the future.\nThe Merger Agreement",

Online check-in will begin at 10:45 a.m. Eastern Time, and you should allow ample time for the check-in\nprocedures.\nAt the Special Meeting, the holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock will be asked to consider and vote upon\nthe following proposals:\n1.\nTo approve the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the \u201cMerger Proposal\u201d)\u037e\n2.\nTo approve on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to\nMonmouth\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby (the \u201cCompensation Proposal\u201d)\u037e and\n3.\nTo approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit\nadditional proxies in favor of the Merger Proposal (the \u201cAdjournment Proposal\u201d).\nShareholders must approve the Merger Proposal for the Merger to occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex A and the material provisions of the Merger Agreement are described in\nthe section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d\nThe vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Because\nthe vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Monmouth. Accordingly, if the\nMerger Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable,\nsubject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements and arrangements,\nregardless of the outcome of the non-binding advisory vote on the Compensation Proposal.\nRecommendation of Monmouth\u2019s Board of Directors",

In so doing, Monmouth has identified, and at times pursued, potential\nstrategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions.\nOn December 1, 2020, Blackwells, one of Monmouth\u2019s shareholders, delivered a letter from Jason Aintabi,\nBlackwells\u2019s Founder and Chief Investment Officer, to Eugene Landy, Chairman of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors,\nand Michael Landy, Monmouth\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, communicating an unsolicited, non-binding\npreliminary proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Monmouth Common Stock in an all-cash transaction\nat a price of $16.75 per share (the \u201cInitial Blackwells Proposal\u201d). On the date of the Initial Blackwells Proposal, shares\nof Monmouth Common Stock closed at $14.80 per share on the NYSE. On December 8, 2020, a special meeting of\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors was held to discuss the Initial Blackwells Proposal, attended by representatives of\nMonmouth\u2019s financial advisor, CSCA, and outside Maryland corporate counsel, Venable LLP (\u201cVenable\u201d). Following\nthat discussion, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously determined that the Initial Blackwells Proposal was not\nin the best interests of Monmouth and, at the direction of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, Mr. Eugene Landy\nconveyed the determination of the board of directors to Blackwells by letter.\nOn December 16, 2020, Monmouth entered into an engagement letter with CSCA under which CSCA would provide\ngeneral advisory services. Monmouth decided to engage CSCA based on, among other things, CSCA\u2019s substantial\nexperience in the REIT industry and Monmouth\u2019s long-standing relationship with CSCA.\nAfter market close on December 18, 2020, Blackwells delivered a revised proposal to Messrs. Eugene Landy and\nMichael Landy offering to pay $18.00 per share in cash to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Monmouth\nCommon Stock (the \u201cRevised Blackwells Proposal\u201d). On the date of the Revised Blackwells Proposal, shares of\nMonmouth Common Stock closed at $16.99 per share on the NYSE.\nOn December 20, 2020, Bloomberg News published an article reporting that Blackwells had offered to acquire\nMonmouth for $18.00 per share in cash, and on December 21, 2020, Blackwells issued a press release disclosing the\nRevised Blackwells Proposal, including the full text of Mr. Aintabi\u2019s December 18, 2020 letter that accompanied the\nRevised Blackwells Proposal. Following publication of the Bloomberg News article and Blackwells\u2019s press release, the\nshare price of Monmouth Common Stock increased $0.72 per share to a closing price of $17.71 per share on December\n21, 2020. Also on December 21, 2020, Monmouth publicly disclosed its receipt of the two proposals from Blackwells.\nOn December 22, 2020, CSCA received an inquiry from a large private investment firm primarily focused on global real\nestate, which we refer to as \u201cBidder A\u201d, indicating an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Monmouth.\n25TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 23, 2020, prior to receiving a response from Monmouth regarding the Revised Blackwells Proposal,\nBlackwells delivered a written notice to Monmouth stating that it intended to nominate a slate of four director\ncandidates, including Monmouth\u2019s former general counsel, to fill the four director seats up for election at\nMonmouth\u2019s 2021 annual meeting of shareholders. Blackwells also stated that it intended to submit six non-binding\nproposals to be voted on by Monmouth\u2019s shareholders at the 2021 annual meeting.\nOn January 13, 2021, Monmouth engaged J.P. Morgan as its additional financial advisor in connection with a possible\ndecision by its board of directors to explore strategic alternatives. Monmouth engaged J.P. Morgan based on J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s substantial industry knowledge, its experience with strategic alternatives processes for other real estate\ncompanies and its prior experience working with Monmouth. Monmouth also entered into an additional engagement\nletter with CSCA dated as of January 13, 2021, expanding the scope of CSCA\u2019s engagement to include advising and\nassisting in connection with a potential strategic alternatives review process.\nOn January 14, 2021, at its regular quarterly board meeting, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors considered, among other\nthings, the Revised Blackwells Proposal. In addition to members of Monmouth\u2019s management, in attendance for\nportions of the meeting were representatives of CSCA, J.P. Morgan and Venable. Following various presentations by\nadvisors, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors further discussed the Revised Blackwells Proposal and unanimously\ndetermined that the Revised Blackwells Proposal was not in the best interests of Monmouth and, at the direction of\nthe board of directors, Mr. Eugene Landy wrote to Blackwells to inform them of the determination of the board of\ndirectors. During the meeting, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors also determined, following a presentation by\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan, that it would be in the best interests of Monmouth to explore potential strategic\nalternatives, including a potential sale. To enable Monmouth\u2019s board of directors to undertake that review in an\nefficient manner, the board of directors decided to form a Strategic Alternatives Committee, consisting of four\ndirectors, Messrs. K.C. Conway and Scott Robinson (each an independent director) and Messrs. Michael Landy and\nKevin Miller, which committee would support the review process and make recommendations to Monmouth\u2019s board\nof directors.\nAlso on January 14, 2021, Monmouth publicly disclosed its board of directors\u2019 determinations to reject the Revised\nBlackwells Proposal and to conduct a review of Monmouth\u2019s potential strategic alternatives. Shortly following the\nannouncement, representatives of Bidder A contacted both CSCA and J.P. Morgan to reiterate Bidder A\u2019s interest in\nexploring a potential transaction.\nShortly after the January 14, 2021 meeting of the board of directors, at the request of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors,\nand with the assistance of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, Monmouth\u2019s management began preparing a Confidential\nInformation Memorandum to be provided to potential counterparties to a strategic transaction. During this period, J.P.\nMorgan and CSCA also received inquiries from a number of parties interested in participating in the strategic\nalternatives process.\nOn January 20, 2021, Monmouth filed suit in state court in New Jersey against its former general counsel and\nBlackwells seeking to bar its former general counsel from participating in the slate of directors nominated by\nBlackwells. Blackwells subsequently sent a litigation demand to Monmouth, alleging that Monmouth\u2019s board of\ndirectors\u2019 decisions to file suit, and not to appoint an independent committee to consider the Initial Blackwells\nProposal and the Revised Blackwells Proposal, was a breach of the board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties. Monmouth\u2019s\nboard of directors thereupon created a committee of independent directors to review the demand with the assistance\nof counsel.\nOn February 1, 2021, Monmouth and its advisors finalized a form non-disclosure agreement to be circulated to\npotential counterparties. In addition, on February 1, 2021, J.P. Morgan and CSCA provided Monmouth with a draft list\nof approximately 90 potential counterparties, including financial sponsors, real estate investment trusts, sovereign\nwealth funds, pension funds, real estate managers and other financial and strategic investors that J.P. Morgan and\nCSCA believed could potentially have an interest in a transaction with Monmouth and likely would have the\ncapability to consummate such a transaction. Subsequently, based on feedback from Monmouth, the advisors added\nadditional potential counterparties to the draft list.\nLater on February 1, 2021, a meeting of the Strategic Alternatives Committee was convened. The Strategic\nAlternatives Committee reviewed and discussed the potential counterparties that had been assembled by J.P. Morgan\nand CSCA with input from Monmouth\u2019s management, noting that the list included numerous credible strategic and\nfinancial bidders. Following this discussion, the Strategic Alternatives Committee approved the proposed list.\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 2, 2021, pursuant to the direction of the Strategic Alternatives Committee, J.P. Morgan, CSCA and Mr.\nMichael Landy began contacting the potential counterparties.\nOn February 12, 2021, Monmouth engaged Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP (\u201cStroock\u201d) to act as legal counsel to\nMonmouth and its board of directors in connection with the strategic alternatives process.\nBetween February 2 and March 5, 2021, Monmouth and its advisors negotiated and executed non-disclosure\nagreements (each a \u201cNon-Disclosure Agreement\u201d and collectively, the \u201cNon-Disclosure Agreements\u201d) with 36\npotential counterparties that were contacted as part of the strategic alternatives review process, including with ILPT,\nEquity Commonwealth (\u201cEQC\u201d) and Bidder A. The Non-Disclosure Agreements generally included customary\nstandstill restrictions on the counterparties but did not prohibit the counterparties from requesting that Monmouth\nwaive such standstill restrictions.\nOn March 16, 2021, Monmouth received four preliminary, non-binding proposals, including proposals from each of\nEQC, ILPT, Bidder A, and a private owner and operator of industrial real estate in the United States, which we refer to\nas \u201cBidder B.\u201d The proposal submitted by EQC represented an all-stock transaction and provided for an exchange of\neach share of Monmouth Common Stock for 0.571 EQC common shares, representing an implied value of $16.22 per\nshare based on the trading price of EQC\u2019s common shares at the time of EQC\u2019s March 16 proposal. The proposals\nsubmitted by ILPT, Bidder A and Bidder B contemplated all-cash transactions with per share offer prices of $19.25,\n$18.30 and $19.50, respectively. None of the four preliminary proposals received by Monmouth addressed the ability\nof Monmouth to pay dividends in respect of Monmouth Common Stock during the period between the execution of a\ndefinitive agreement and the closing. Each of ILPT, EQC, Bidder A and Bidder B were invited to continue to\nparticipate in the next stage of the strategic alternatives process.\nBefore the deadline for the submission of revised proposals, various telephone calls and e-mails were exchanged\nbetween Monmouth and its advisors, on the one hand, and representatives of each of ILPT, EQC, Bidder A and\nBidder B regarding diligence and process matters. Additionally, during this period, ILPT, EQC and Bidder A also\nconducted tours of a large number of Monmouth\u2019s properties.\nOn April 20, 2021, EQC and ILPT delivered revised proposals and, the following morning on April 21, 2021, Bidder A\nsubmitted a revised proposal. Bidder B did not submit a revised proposal. ILPT\u2019s revised proposal consisted of an all-\ncash offer to acquire all shares of Monmouth Common Stock at a price of $18.50 per share. ILPT\u2019s offer noted that\nMonmouth may not pay any dividends to holders of Monmouth Common Stock between signing of the merger\nagreement and the closing of the merger. EQC\u2019s revised proposal provided for an all-stock transaction in which each\nshare of Monmouth Common Stock would be exchanged for 0.6638 EQC common shares, representing an implied\nvalue of $19.15 per share based on EQC\u2019s closing stock price of $28.85 per share on April 20, 2021 and, when added to\nthe $0.18 per share dividend payable to holders of Monmouth Common Stock on June 15, 2021 that had been\npreviously declared by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, would result in an effective price of $19.33 per share of\nMonmouth Common Stock in light of EQC\u2019s expressed willingness to permit Monmouth to pay the previously\ndeclared dividend and to refrain from paying a matching pre-merger cash dividend to EQC\u2019s common stockholders in\nrespect of such previously declared $0.18 per share dividend. Bidder A\u2019s revised proposal consisted of an all-cash\noffer to acquire all shares of Monmouth Common Stock for a price of $19.00 per share. Bidder A\u2019s revised proposal\nprohibited the payment of any dividends to holders of Monmouth Common Stock between signing and closing of the\nmerger, which would include the $0.18 per share dividend payable on June 15, 2021 previously declared by\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors, other than dividends necessary to maintain Monmouth\u2019s REIT qualification, and\nrequired that the stated price of $19.00 per share be reduced by the amount of any such REIT qualification dividends\npaid between signing and closing of the merger. The Strategic Alternatives Committee determined that an additional\nround of bidding was advisable, and that each of ILPT, EQC and Bidder A should be invited to submit \u201cbest and\nfinal\u201d offers the following week.\nOn April 23, 2021, ILPT informed J.P. Morgan that it was withdrawing from the process, explaining that it was not in a\nposition to improve its proposal.\nOn April 28, 2021, EQC and Bidder A each submitted best and final proposals. EQC\u2019s final proposal consisted of an\nall-stock offer with 0.67 EQC shares to be issued in exchange for each share of Monmouth Common Stock, resulting\nin a base offer price of $19.08 per share based on EQC\u2019s closing stock price of $28.48 on April 27, 2021. In addition,\nEQC\u2019s final proposal (including the revised draft merger agreement\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nattached thereto) provided for up to $0.36 of additional value to the holders of Monmouth Common Stock by\nallowing Monmouth to pay the $0.18 per share regular quarterly common stock dividend that had been declared in\nApril 2021, and to declare and pay an additional $0.18 per share regular quarterly common dividend prior the closing\nof the merger, without EQC declaring or paying a matching pre-merger cash dividend to EQC\u2019s shareholders. Bidder\nA\u2019s final proposal was an all-cash offer to acquire all shares of Monmouth Common Stock at a stated price of $19.51\nper share. Bidder A\u2019s proposal provided that the per share price to be paid in the merger would be reduced by the\namount of any dividends declared or paid by Monmouth on shares of Monmouth Common Stock between signing\nand closing of the merger, including the $0.18 per share dividend payable on June 15, 2021 previously declared by\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors.\nAlso on April 28, 2021, several meetings of the Strategic Alternatives Committee and Monmouth\u2019s board of directors\nwere held to discuss the final proposals received from EQC and Bidder A. Following extensive discussions involving\nMonmouth\u2019s advisors, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously approved the Strategic Alternatives Committee\u2019s\nrecommendation to accept the EQC draft merger agreement and final proposal, subject to finalizing documentation.\nBetween April 28 and May 4, 2021, Mr. Michael Landy, and representatives from J.P. Morgan, CSCA, Stroock, EQC\nand EQC\u2019s financial and legal advisors negotiated the merger agreement, and final confirmatory due diligence was\ncompleted.\nAdditional meetings of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors were held on April 30, 2021 to hear presentations by J.P.\nMorgan and CSCA with respect to their preliminary valuation analyses of the economic terms of the proposed\ntransaction with EQC and on May 4, 2021 to consider approval of the merger agreement. Following the delivery of\noral fairness opinions by each of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, and an update on the terms and status of the merger\nagreement by Stroock, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously adopted resolutions approving the merger\nagreement and related matters. Later in the evening on May 4, 2021, Monmouth entered into a merger agreement with\nEQC and issued a joint press release regarding Monmouth\u2019s proposed merger with EQC.\nAmong the Non-Disclosure Agreements, the standstill restrictions in nine Non-Disclosure Agreements expired by\ntheir terms upon Monmouth\u2019s execution of the merger agreement with EQC. Following the execution of the merger\nagreement with EQC, Monmouth notified the counterparties for the remaining 26 Non-Disclosure Agreements that\nMonmouth was granting an irrevocable waiver of the standstill restrictions to permit the counterparties to submit a\nproposal, inquiry or indication of interest regarding a possible transaction to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors and to\nmake a public announcement of any such proposal, inquiry or indication of interest, so long as, in any such case,\nsuch counterparties did not engage in discussions or negotiations, or enter into any agreements or understandings,\nwhether or not legally enforceable, with any third party (excluding the counterparty\u2019s affiliates and representatives)\nwith respect to any such proposal, inquiry or indication of interest.\nOn July 8, 2021, J.P. Morgan and CSCA received a letter from Starwood Capital Group (\u201cStarwood\u201d) setting forth an\nunsolicited proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of Monmouth Common Stock for net cash consideration of\napproximately $18.70 per share, reflecting a stated purchase price of $19.51 per share reduced by the termination fee\npayable to EQC under the merger agreement executed on May 4, 2021 and the $0.18 per share dividend on shares of\nMonmouth Common Stock declared by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors on July 1, 2021. On July 15, Starwood\ndelivered an amended proposal, reflecting an increase of $0.18 per share in the consideration that would be paid for\nshares of Monmouth Common Stock, resulting in a net cash consideration of $18.88 per share, reflecting a stated\npurchase price of $19.51 per share reduced only by the termination fee payable to EQC (with no reduction for the\n$0.18 per share dividend previously declared by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors on July 1, 2021). On July 21, 2021, a\nspecial meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was convened for the purpose of discussing the July 8, 2021\nStarwood proposal, as amended on July 15, 2021, and determining a response. Following such discussion,\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously reaffirmed its support for, and recommendation in favor of, the then-\npending merger with EQC.\nOn July 29, 2021, the committee that Monmouth\u2019s board of directors had appointed to review the litigation demand\nserved by Blackwells advised the board of directors that it had completed its work and that it recommended that\nMonmouth not file suit against its board of directors. The committee determined, among other\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthings, that Monmouth did not have a duty to establish a special committee to review Blackwells\u2019s offer, and that the\nboard of directors had appropriately considered the potential benefits and harms of pursuing litigation against its\nformer general counsel and Blackwells before doing so. Monmouth\u2019s board of directors accepted this\nrecommendation.\nBetween July 27, 2021 and August 13, 2021, members of management of EQC and of Monmouth, and representatives\nof each party\u2019s financial, legal and proxy advisors, periodically discussed the status of the proposed merger with EQC\nand the related proxy solicitations. On August 13, 2021, representatives of EQC submitted an offer letter to\nMonmouth proposing certain revisions to the existing terms of the merger agreement, including (1) an increase in the\nmerger consideration to $19.00 for each share of Monmouth Common Stock by increasing the exchange ratio from\n0.67 EQC shares per share of Monmouth Common Stock to 0.713 EQC shares per share of Monmouth Common Stock,\nwhich represented a 6.4% premium over the existing all-stock transaction based on the closing price of EQC\u2019s\ncommon shares on August 13, 2021 of $26.65, and (2) the option for Monmouth shareholders to elect to receive such\nconsideration in the form of cash, EQC common shares or a combination of cash and EQC common shares, in each\ncase, subject to proration based upon a maximum cash amount. The terms of EQC\u2019s revised proposal with respect to\npayment of dividends on shares of Monmouth Common Stock were consistent with the provisions of the original\nmerger agreement Monmouth entered into with EQC.\nFollowing receipt of EQC\u2019s offer letter, members of management of EQC and of Monmouth, and representatives of\neach party\u2019s financial and legal advisors, conducted negotiations concerning the terms of an amended merger\nagreement. Monmouth\u2019s board of directors also met on August 13, 2021 and twice on August 15, 2021 to discuss\nEQC\u2019s offer letter and the proposed amended merger agreement. Following the delivery of new oral fairness opinions\nby each of J.P. Morgan and CSCA with respect to the revised financial terms of the transaction and an update on the\nterms and status of the amended merger agreement by Stroock, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously\napproved the execution of an amended merger agreement with EQC and recommended that Monmouth\u2019s shareholders\napprove the merger with EQC on the amended terms at a special meeting of shareholders scheduled for August 31,\n2021. In the evening of August 15, 2021, Monmouth and EQC executed the amended merger agreement and on the\nmorning of August 16, 2021, Monmouth and EQC issued a joint press release announcing entry into the amended\nmerger agreement with EQC.\nOn August 18, 2021, Monmouth received a new revised unsolicited acquisition proposal from Starwood. Starwood\u2019s\nrevised proposal provided for net cash consideration of approximately $19.20 per share of Monmouth Common Stock.\nThis revised offer represented a stated per share purchase price of $19.93 per share, reduced by the termination fee\nthat would be payable to EQC if Monmouth terminated the amended merger agreement with EQC (with no reduction\nfor the $0.18 per share dividend previously declared by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors on July 1, 2021). On August\n23, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was convened for the purpose of discussing and\ndetermining what action(s) to take in response to the revised Starwood proposal. Following such discussion,\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously decided to reaffirm its support for the then-pending merger with EQC,\nand Monmouth issued a press release announcing this decision on August 23, 2021.\nOn August 31, 2021, at a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s shareholders held for purposes of voting on the proposed\nmerger with EQC, the holders of Monmouth\u2019s common shares did not approve Monmouth\u2019s proposed merger with\nEQC as required by Maryland law and the terms of Monmouth\u2019s charter. Later on August 31, 2021, Monmouth\nreceived a written notice from EQC terminating the amended merger agreement as a result of the failure of\nMonmouth\u2019s shareholders to approve the merger and requesting reimbursement of its out-of-pocket fees and\nexpenses pursuant to the terms of the amended merger agreement. Subsequently, after receiving documentation\nrelating to such out-of-pocket fees and expenses from EQC, Monmouth reimbursed EQC in accordance with the terms\nof the amended merger agreement. Blackwells subsequently indicated to Monmouth that Monmouth should convene\nan annual meeting of its shareholders.\nOn September 7, 2021, Monmouth engaged Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d) to act as legal\ncounsel to Monmouth and its board of directors in connection with its determination of what action(s) to take\nfollowing the termination of the amended merger agreement with EQC.\nOn September 13, 2021, Monmouth issued a press release announcing that it was re-initiating the process of\nexploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger, joint ventures, and changes in the capital\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstructure of Monmouth, and that it would consider all viable proposals, including proposals submitted by Starwood\nor other potential counterparties. Monmouth also announced that it would set meeting and record dates for\nMonmouth\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders in due course.\nOn September 14, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was held to discuss the timeline for the\nrenewed strategic alternatives process, potential counterparties and engagement with shareholders. In light of the\nfact that Monmouth had previously run a strategic alternatives process with numerous potential counterparties and\nentered into, and made significant public disclosure in connection with, the EQC transaction, which had since been\nterminated, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors determined to proceed with the renewed strategic alternatives process on\nan accelerated timetable, in order to determine in short order whether an alternative transaction that would provide for\nan acquisition of the whole company could be achieved on terms that would be in the best interests of Monmouth\nand its shareholders. In addition, the board of directors determined that the renewed strategic alternatives process\nwould be overseen by the board of directors as a whole (and not the Strategic Alternatives Committee (which\ncommittee was disbanded)).\nBeginning on September 15, 2021, based on indications of interest gathered during the initial outreach to\ncounterparties in February 2021, Monmouth\u2019s management and its financial and legal advisors finalized a list of\npotential counterparties for the renewed strategic alternatives process and initiated contact with 22 potential\ncounterparties. All of the counterparties who had submitted a bid during the prior strategic alternatives process were\ninvited to participate in the renewed strategic alternatives process. Of the 22 potential counterparties, eight expressed\ninterest in participating in the renewed strategic alternatives process and were granted access to Monmouth\u2019s virtual\ndataroom to conduct due diligence. Five of the counterparties granted access to the virtual dataroom had already\nexecuted Non-Disclosure Agreements with Monmouth as part of the prior strategic alternatives process, and three\ncounterparties executed new Non-Disclosure Agreements, which included customary standstill restrictions on the\ncounterparties but did not prohibit the counterparties from requesting that Monmouth waive such standstill\nrestrictions. All counterparties were advised to submit indicative proposals by October 5, 2021. When invited to\nparticipate in the process, Blackwells indicated it would not be submitting an offer for Monmouth and declined to\nparticipate.\nBetween September 15, 2021 and October 4, 2021, members of Monmouth\u2019s management and its financial advisors\nheld a number of due diligence sessions with, and responded to documentary diligence requests from, the interested\npotential counterparties in the renewed strategic alternatives process.\nOn September 21, 2021, Monmouth engaged CBRE, Inc. (\u201cCBRE\u201d) to assist in Monmouth\u2019s exploration of joint\nventure alternatives. From its engagement until the execution of the Merger Agreement on November 5, 2021, CBRE\nreached out to and engaged with various potential joint venture partners.\nOn September 23, 2021, counsel for Blackwells wrote to counsel for Monmouth demanding that Monmouth file suit\nagainst Mr. Eugene Landy and other directors for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the matters\nraised in Blackwells\u2019s prior litigation demand and the now-terminated EQC merger agreement. Counsel for Blackwells\nalso demanded that Monmouth provide notice to shareholders of the date of its annual meeting by September 29,\n2021. Also on September 23, 2021, Blackwells submitted to Monmouth a revised notice of its intention to nominate a\nnew slate of four director candidates, which did not include Monmouth\u2019s former general counsel. Blackwells also\nstated that it intended to submit seven revised non-binding proposals to be voted on by Monmouth\u2019s shareholders\nat Monmouth\u2019s 2021 annual meeting.\nBetween September and November 2021, representatives of Monmouth and Blackwells had periodic discussions\nregarding Blackwells\u2019s proposals and its perspectives on Monmouth and a potential resolution of Blackwells\u2019s\ncampaign.\nOn October 5, 2021, Monmouth received preliminary, non-binding proposals from ILPT and two other counterparties,\nwhich we refer to as \u201cBidder 1\u201d and \u201cBidder 2.\u201d ILPT proposed to acquire Monmouth in an all-cash transaction for\n$19.25 per share. The proposals submitted by Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 represented all-cash acquisitions of Monmouth\nfor net consideration of $19.30 and $19.75 per share, respectively. ILPT and Bidder 1 indicated that they were ready to\nenter into definitive agreements for the acquisition within a short period of time, whereas Bidder 2 indicated that it\nwould need more time to undertake further due diligence. The bidders also indicated that they were exploring the\npossibility of providing an option to elect non-cash consideration for\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\na portion of the transaction consideration. Bidder 1 indicated that it would permit Monmouth to pay its regular\nquarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, prorated until closing, without any reduction in the merger\nconsideration, while ILPT\u2019s and Bidder 2\u2019s proposals did not specify the treatment of dividends.\nOn October 6, 2021, Mr. Eugene Landy called Mr. John Murray, ILPT's Managing Trustee, President, and Chief\nExecutive Officer, to encourage ILPT to advance its participation in the renewed strategic alternatives process.\nLater on October 6, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was held to discuss the indicative\nproposals received from the three potential counterparties, attended by representatives of J.P. Morgan, CSCA, and\nWachtell Lipton. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton and of J.P. Morgan updated the board of directors on the\nprogress of the strategic alternatives process to date, structural options for a potential transaction, and possible\nbusiness and financial alternatives, such as a joint venture. Following discussion of the merits of various strategic\nalternatives, including remaining an independent company, joint venture, and a sale of Monmouth, Monmouth\u2019s\nboard of directors unanimously authorized Monmouth and its advisors to continue with the strategic alternatives\nprocess and engagement with the three counterparties. The duties of the board of directors were also discussed by\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton.\nOn October 7, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, acting at the direction of Monmouth\u2019s board of\ndirectors, called representatives of ILPT, Bidder 1, and Bidder 2 to advise them that while Monmouth expected that\nthey would have to increase their proposed prices in order to enter into a transaction, they would be invited into the\nsecond round of the renewed strategic alternatives process. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA also provided\nall three potential counterparties with a draft of a merger agreement prepared by Wachtell Lipton. The counterparties\nwere advised to submit revised drafts of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton by October 22, 2021 for an\nopportunity to receive feedback in advance of their final bids, and to submit final proposals by November 1, 2021.\nAlso on October 7, 2021, Monmouth filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing that it had set\nDecember 16, 2021, as the date for the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, and that October 17, 2021 was the\ndeadline for the submission of shareholder notices of business to be considered at that meeting.\nBetween October 18, 2021 and October 21, 2021, members of Monmouth\u2019s management and its financial advisors\nparticipated in further due diligence sessions with representatives of ILPT, Bidder 1, and Bidder 2.\nOn October 22, 2021, representatives of Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP (\u201cHunton\u201d), ILPT\u2019s legal advisor, submitted a\nrevised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 did not submit\nmarkups of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton in advance of the final bid deadline.\nOn October 27, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided feedback to Hunton regarding its revised draft of\nthe merger agreement, including feedback regarding closing conditionality and the termination fee payable by\nMonmouth under the merger agreement under certain circumstances.\nOn October 29, 2021, representatives of Bidder 1 called representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA and indicated that\nBidder 1 would not be able to increase its previous offer and did not intend to submit a revised proposal at the final\nbid deadline.\nAlso on October 29, 2021, representatives of Bidder 2 contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to indicate that,\nfollowing its evaluation of Monmouth\u2019s projected growth profile, Bidder 2 would not be able to increase its previous\noffer and did not intend to submit a revised proposal at the final bid deadline.\nOn November 1, 2021, ILPT submitted its \u201cbest and final\u201d all-cash offer of $21.00 per share.

Representatives of Wachtell Lipton\nreviewed with the board of directors the terms proposed by ILPT, as well as open issues and remaining areas of\nnegotiation. Members of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors noted the compelling value that ILPT\u2019s offer represented.\nFollowing that discussion, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously authorized Monmouth and its advisors to\nnegotiate with ILPT to seek to finalize definitive documentation for the transaction.\nLater on November 2, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, acting at the direction of Monmouth\u2019s board of\ndirectors, called Mr. Adam Portnoy, ILPT\u2019s Managing Trustee, and representatives of Citigroup, ILPT\u2019s financial\nadvisor, to inform them of Monmouth\u2019s willingness to negotiate definitive documentation for the transaction with\nILPT, subject to agreement on certain terms, including a reduced termination fee, reduced expense reimbursement\nobligation of Monmouth, and shorter duration for ILPT\u2019s right to delay the closing under certain circumstances. ILPT\nand its representatives indicated that ILPT was prepared to agree to a transaction that reflected the terms proposed\nby representatives of Monmouth.\nOn November 3, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent to representatives of Hunton a markup of the merger\nagreement and Monmouth\u2019s disclosure letter to the merger agreement. Thereafter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton\nand of Hunton provided to each other successive markups of the merger agreement and Monmouth\u2019s disclosure\nletter, until such documents were finalized.\nAlso on November 3, 2021, representatives of Hunton sent to representatives of Wachtell Lipton a draft form of\nvoting agreement for Messrs. Eugene Landy and Michael Landy. Thereafter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and\nof Hunton provided to each other successive markups of the form of voting agreement until it was finalized.\nOn November 4, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was convened to consider approval of the\nmerger agreement with ILPT. In addition to members of Monmouth\u2019s management, in attendance at the meeting were\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan, CSCA and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors the key terms of the proposed final merger agreement. Representatives of J.P. Morgan\nand CSCA then reviewed their financial analyses of the consideration provided for in the merger agreement.\nFollowing their presentation, representatives of J.P. Morgan delivered to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s oral opinion, confirmed the following day by delivery of a written opinion dated November 4, 2021, to the\neffect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the consideration to be\npaid to Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Monmouth\u2019s\ncommon shareholders, as more fully described below in the section \u201cThe Merger-Opinions of Monmouth\u2019s Financial\nAdvisors.\u201d Following their presentation, representatives of CSCA delivered to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors\nCSCA\u2019s oral opinion, confirmed later that day by delivery of a written opinion dated November 4, 2021, to the effect\nthat, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered\nand limitations on the review undertaken by CSCA in preparing its opinion, that the consideration to be received by\nMonmouth\u2019s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Monmouth\u2019s common\nshareholders. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton also reviewed the directors\u2019 duties in connection with their\nconsideration and evaluation of the potential transaction. Following discussion, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors\nunanimously adopted resolutions approving the merger agreement and related matters.\nAlso on November 4, 2021, Monmouth, with the approval of its board of directors, entered into an agreement with\nBlackwells pursuant to which Blackwells would withdraw its proposals, support the proposed transaction and enter\ninto various standstill, solicitation and support arrangements. Monmouth simultaneously entered into an agreement\nwith its former general counsel and Blackwells to settle and dismiss all claims between them in the New Jersey\nlitigation.\nOn the morning of November 5, 2021, prior to market open, Monmouth and ILPT executed the Merger Agreement and\neach issued a press release announcing entry into the Merger.\nRecommendation of Monmouth\u2019s Board of Directors and Its Reasons for the Merger",

In addition, different members of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors may have given different\nweight to different factors. Monmouth\u2019s board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any\nof the factors considered and instead conducted an overall review of such factors and determined that, in the\naggregate, the potential benefits considered outweighed the potential risks or possible negative consequences of\napproving the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThis explanation of the reasoning of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors and all other information presented in this\nsection is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section\nentitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nAfter careful consideration, for the reasons set forth above, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously\nrecommends that Monmouth\u2019s shareholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal,\nand \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nOpinions of Monmouth\u2019s Financial Advisors",

Morgan rendered its oral opinion to\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its\nopinion, the consideration to be paid to Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial\npoint of view, to such shareholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its November 4, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its\nwritten opinion to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, dated November 4, 2021, that, as of such date, the consideration\nto be paid to Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nshareholders.\n35TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated November 4, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan\nin preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The\nsummary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the\nfull text of such opinion. Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s opinion was addressed to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and\nfor the purposes of its evaluation of the Merger, was directed only to the consideration to be paid to Monmouth\u2019s\ncommon shareholders in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no\nopinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger to the holders of any other\nclass of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Monmouth or as to the underlying decision by Monmouth to\nengage in the Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan.\nThe opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Monmouth as to how such shareholder\nshould vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft dated November 3, 2021 of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Monmouth and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain\ntransactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of Monmouth with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of shares of Monmouth Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management\nof Monmouth relating to its business, as discussed more fully under \u201cThe Merger-Summary of Certain\nMonmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of Monmouth with respect to\ncertain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of Monmouth, the financial condition\nand future prospects and operations of Monmouth, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or\nappropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Monmouth or otherwise reviewed by or for\nJ.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and,\npursuant to J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement letter with Monmouth, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to\nundertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or was not provided with any valuation or\nappraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of Monmouth or ILPT under any state\nor federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts\nprovided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on\nassumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by Monmouth\u2019s management as to the\nexpected future results of operations and financial condition of Monmouth to which such analyses or forecasts\nrelate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based.\nJ.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement would\nbe consummated as described in the Merger Agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and\nwarranties made by Monmouth, ILPT and Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and\nwould be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and\nhas relied on the assessments made by\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nadvisors to Monmouth with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental,\nregulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger would be obtained\nwithout any adverse effect on Monmouth or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.\nThe projections furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by Monmouth\u2019s management, as discussed more fully under\n\u201cThe Merger-Summary of Certain Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d. Monmouth does not\nroutinely publicly disclose internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis of the Merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure.\nThese projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be\nbeyond the control of Monmouth\u2019s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic\nand competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from\nthose set forth in such projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking\nstatements, please refer to the section of the proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger-Summary of Certain Monmouth\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nto Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders, of the consideration to be paid to Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders in the\nMerger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection\nwith the Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Monmouth or as\nto the underlying decision by Monmouth to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion\nwith respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the\nMerger, or any class of such persons relative to the consideration to be paid to Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders in\nthe Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the\nprice at which shares of Monmouth Common Stock will trade at any future time.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the consideration to be paid to Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders,\nwere determined through arm\u2019s length negotiations between Monmouth and ILPT, and the decision to enter into the\nMerger Agreement was solely that of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses\nwere only one of the many factors considered by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors in its evaluation of the Merger and\nshould not be viewed as determinative of the views of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors or Monmouth\u2019s management\nwith respect to the Merger or the consideration to be paid to Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodologies in rendering its opinion to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors on November 4, 2021 and in the financial\nanalysis presented to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion.\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its\nopinion to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data\npresented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular\nformat. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used\nby J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth\nbelow without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and\nassumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of\nMonmouth with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged\nto be sufficiently analogous to those engaged in by Monmouth. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as\nfollows:\n\u2022\nSTAG Industrial, Inc.\n\u2022\nLexington Realty Trust\n\u2022\nMonmouth\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThese companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations\nand businesses that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to those of Monmouth.\nHowever, certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of Monmouth.\nThe analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies\ndifferently than they would affect Monmouth.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratios of (a) the\ncompany\u2019s price per common share to the consensus equity research analyst estimates for the company\u2019s adjusted\nfunds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) per common share for the year ending December 31, 2022 (the \u201cP/2022E AFFO\u201d), (b)\nthe company\u2019s price per common share to the consensus equity research analyst estimates for the company\u2019s funds\nfrom operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) per common share for the year ending December 31, 2022 (the \u201cP/2022E FFO\u201d), and (c)\nconsensus equity research analyst estimates for the company\u2019s in-place cash net operating income for the year\nending December 31, 2022 to consensus equity research analyst estimates for the company\u2019s implied real estate value\n(the \u201cImplied Capitalization Rate\u201d).\nBased on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected multiple reference ranges of 21.00x - 22.50x, 19.50x - 21.00x\nand 4.7% - 4.9% for P/2022E AFFO, P/2022E FFO and the Implied Capitalization Rate, respectively. After applying\nsuch ranges to the projected AFFO for Monmouth for the year ending December 31, 2022, the projected FFO for\nMonmouth for the year ending December 31, 2022 and the projected in-place cash net operating income for\nMonmouth for the year ending December 31, 2022, respectively, the analysis indicated the following ranges of implied\nper share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for shares of Monmouth Common Stock:\nImplied Per Share Equity\nValue\nLow\nHigh\nMonmouth P/2022E AFFO\n$18.75\n$20.00\nMonmouth P/2022E FFO\n$18.00\n$19.50\nMonmouth Implied Capitalization Rate\n$19.00\n$20.50\nThe ranges of implied per share equity value for Monmouth Common Stock were compared to (i) the 30-day\nunaffected volume-weighted average price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $15.43 as of the Unaffected\nDate, (ii) the closing price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $19.01 as of November 3, 2021, the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion dated November 4, 2021, and (iii) the Merger\nConsideration of $21.00 per share.\nSelected Transaction Multiples Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined the May 2018\nacquisition (the \u201cGramercy Acquisition\u201d) by The Blackstone Group LP (\u201cBlackstone\u201d) of Gramercy Property Trust\n(\u201cGramercy\u201d), a target company engaged in a business which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the\nbusiness of Monmouth or aspects thereof. Neither Blackstone nor Gramercy is identical to ILPT or Monmouth and\nthe Gramercy Acquisition is not identical to the Merger. However, the Gramercy Acquisition was selected, among\nother reasons, since Gramercy, for purpose of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, shares similar business characteristics with\nMonmouth based on business sector participation, operational characteristics, and financial metrics. This analysis\nnecessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational\ncharacteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the Gramercy Acquisition as compared\nto the Merger.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated the ratio of Gramercy\u2019s in-place cash net operating\nincome for the forward twelve month period to the implied real estate value of the Gramercy Acquisition based on\ncompany filings, information obtained from FactSet Research Systems and public news sources, indicating an Implied\nCapitalization Rate of 6.1%. After applying such rate to Monmouth\u2019s forward cash net operating income, inclusive of\nestimated income from in-contract acquisitions and currently in-progress expansion projects, this analysis indicated\nan implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of $12.00 for Monmouth Common Stock.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe estimate of implied per share equity value for Monmouth Common Stock was compared to (i) the 30-day\nunaffected volume-weighted average price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $15.43 as of the Unaffected\nDate, (ii) the closing price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $19.01 as of November 3, 2021, the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion dated November 4, 2021, and (iii) the Merger\nConsideration of $21.00 per share.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of\ndetermining an implied fully diluted equity value per share for Monmouth Common Stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the\nunlevered free cash flows that Monmouth is expected to generate during calendar years 2021E through 2026E based\nupon the financial projections prepared by Monmouth\u2019s management (as set forth below in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger-Summary of Certain Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d, which was discussed with,\nand approved by, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors for use by J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analyses).\nJ.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for Monmouth at the end of this period by applying perpetual\ngrowth rates ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%, based on guidance provided by Monmouth\u2019s management, to estimates of\nthe net operating income for Monmouth at the end of fiscal-year 2026E, as provided in the Monmouth management\nprojections. J.P. Morgan then discounted the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values to\npresent value as of September 30, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 6.50% to 7.00% for Monmouth, which\nranges were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Monmouth.\nThe present value of the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted by\nsubtracting net debt and other adjustments for Monmouth as of September 30, 2021.\nBased on the foregoing, this analysis indicated the following ranges of implied per share equity value (rounded to the\nnearest $0.25) for Monmouth Common Stock:\nImplied Per Share Equity\nValue\nLow\nHigh\nMonmouth Discounted Cash Flow\n$11.00\n$18.25\nThe range of implied per share equity values for Monmouth Common Stock was compared to (i) the 30-day\nunaffected volume-weighted average price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $15.43 as of the Unaffected\nDate, (ii) the closing price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $19.01 as of November 3, 2021, the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion dated November 4, 2021, and (iii) the Merger\nConsideration of $21.00 per share.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the\nforegoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing\nsummary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of\nthe processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any\nparticular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of\nMonmouth. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those\nanalyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses\nor factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or\nnegative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the\ntotality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.\nMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected\ncompanies reviewed as described in the above summary are identical to Monmouth, and the Gramercy Acquisition,\nthe selected transaction reviewed as described in the above summary, was not identical to the Merger. However, the\ncompanies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\noperations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to those of\nMonmouth. The Gramercy Acquisition was similarly chosen because its participants, size and other factors, for\npurposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger. The analyses necessarily involve\ncomplex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the\ncompanies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to Monmouth and the Gramercy\nAcquisition compared to the Merger.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control\npurposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise Monmouth with respect to the\nMerger and deliver an opinion to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among\nother things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity\nwith Monmouth and the industries in which it operates.\nFor financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Merger, Monmouth has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an\nestimated fee of approximately $17 million, $4.5 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan when J.P. Morgan\ndelivered prior opinions in connection with the now-terminated transaction with EQC to Monmouth\u2019s board of\ndirectors, $1.5 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion to\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors on November 4, 2021 and the remainder of which is contingent and payable upon the\nconsummation of the Merger. In addition, Monmouth has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for certain of its expenses\nincurred in connection with its services, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, and will indemnify\nJ.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement. During the two years preceding the\ndate of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other material financial advisory or\nother material commercial or investment banking relationships with Monmouth (except for acting as joint lead\narranger and joint lead bookrunner on a Monmouth credit facility in November 2019), or any material financial\nadvisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with ILPT or The RMR Group LLC\n(\u201cRMR\u201d), ILPT\u2019s business manager. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than\n1% of the outstanding common shares of each of Monmouth and ILPT. In the ordinary course of their businesses,\nJ.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including\nderivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Monmouth or ILPT for their own accounts or for the accounts of\ncustomers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial\ninstruments. During the two year period preceding the date of its opinion ending on November 4, 2021, the aggregate\nfees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Monmouth were approximately $5 million and from ILPT and RMR were less\nthan $50,000.\nOpinion of CSCA\nCSCA was engaged by Monmouth to serve as a financial advisor in connection with the Merger. On November 4,\n2021, CSCA rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of CSCA\u2019s written\nopinion dated November 4, 2021) to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject\nto the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by\nthe holders of Monmouth Common Stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to Monmouth\u2019s common\nshareholders.\nThe full text of CSCA\u2019s written opinion, dated as of November 4, 2021, is attached as Annex C to this proxy\nstatement. CSCA\u2019s written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed,\nfactors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by CSCA in rendering its opinion. You are\nencouraged to read CSCA\u2019s opinion carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of CSCA\u2019s opinion and the\nmethodology that CSCA used to render its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full\ntext of CSCA\u2019s opinion.\nCSCA\u2019s opinion, the issuance of which was approved by CSCA\u2019s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its\npolicies and procedures established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, is addressed to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of\nview, to the holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by the\nholders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock in the Merger.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn arriving at its opinion, CSCA reviewed and considered such financial and other matters as CSCA deemed relevant\nand appropriate under the circumstances. CSCA\u2019s procedures, investigations, and financial analysis with respect to\nthe preparation of its opinion included, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nReviewed Monmouth\u2019s (i) audited financial information for the twelve-month periods ended September 30,\n2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, (ii) draft unaudited financial information for the three-month and twelve-\nmonth periods ended September 30, 2021, and (iii) projected financial information relating to the business,\nearnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and capitalization, including certain internal analyses and forecasts\nprepared by the management of Monmouth as discussed more fully under \u201cThe Merger-Summary of\nCertain Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d All of the foregoing information was\nprepared and provided to CSCA by Monmouth management\u037e\n\u2022\nReviewed certain publicly available audited and unaudited financial statements and other publicly available\nbusiness, financial and other information of Monmouth including but not limited to the Annual Report filed\non Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and related supplementary financial information\nthereto, and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and related supplementary information for each of the fiscal\nquarters ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020\u037e\n\u2022\nReviewed drafts of the Merger Agreement, the most recent draft dated November 4, 2021, and the\ndisclosure schedules thereto\u037e\n\u2022\nCompared certain publicly available financial information of Monmouth with similar publicly available\ninformation of other comparable publicly traded industrial and net lease REITs, as CSCA deemed relevant to\nits analyses\u037e\n\u2022\nReviewed the terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable transactions, and compared such\nterms to the terms of the Merger, as CSCA deemed relevant to its analysis\u037e\n\u2022\nReviewed the stock price history of Monmouth and compared such prices to the terms of the Merger, as\nCSCA deemed relevant to its analysis\u037e\n\u2022\nPerformed various financial analyses as CSCA deemed appropriate, using generally accepted analytical\nvaluation methodologies\u037e and\n\u2022\nPerformed such other analyses, inquiries and investigations and consideration of such other factors as\nCSCA deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion, including its knowledge of REITs, the industrial\nreal estate sector, as well as its experience in connection with similar transactions and securities valuation\ngenerally.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, CSCA assumed, without independently verifying or confirming, at the\ndirection of Monmouth, that the terms of the Merger will conform in all material respects with those set forth in the\nMerger Agreement and the disclosure schedules thereto. CSCA also assumed that the Merger Agreement and any\ndisclosure schedules thereto provided to it in draft form would ultimately be executed in final form consistent in all\nmaterial respects with the most recent drafts provided and that the Merger and all related transactions described in or\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement and the disclosure schedules thereto occur in all material respects as\ndescribed in and contemplated by such documents. CSCA also assumed in all respects material to its analyses that\nthe representations and warranties of the parties to any agreement entered into in connection with the Merger would\nbe true and correct, that the parties to such agreements would perform all of the covenants and agreements required\nto be performed by it under such agreements, and that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger would be\nsatisfied without any material modification or waiver thereof. CSCA also assumed that all governmental, regulatory\nand other consents and approvals contemplated by the Merger would be obtained and that in the course of\nobtaining any of those consents, no restrictions or conditions (including any divestiture requirements) would be\nimposed or waivers made that would have an adverse effect on any of Monmouth, Merger Sub, or ILPT or the\ncontemplated Merger, except as provided in the Merger Agreement or the disclosure schedules thereto.\nFor purposes of its opinion, CSCA, with Monmouth\u2019s board of directors\u2019 consent, assumed and relied upon, without\nindependent verification, and was advised by management of Monmouth as to, the accuracy and\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncompleteness of all projections provided by management of Monmouth and all financial and other information\npublicly available to, furnished to, or otherwise made available to or discussed with CSCA including, without\nlimitation, the items listed above as reviewed by and/or discussed with CSCA and the financial statements and\nforecasts as provided by management of Monmouth. With respect to financial information, at Monmouth\u2019s direction,\nCSCA assumed without independent verification that (i) such financial information, projections and other information\nwere reasonably prepared on a basis that reflected the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of\nthe management of Monmouth, (ii) such financial information and projections were a reasonable basis to evaluate\nMonmouth, and at the direction of Monmouth, CSCA relied upon such financial information and projections for\npurposes of its analyses and its opinion and (iii) there had been no material adverse change in the assets, financial\ncondition, business or prospects of Monmouth. CSCA assumed no responsibility for and expressed no opinion as to\nthe forecasts or the assumptions on which they were made. CSCA also assumed that as to all legal matters pertaining\nto Monmouth, Monmouth had been appropriately advised by Monmouth\u2019s legal counsel.\nCSCA was not engaged to, and therefore did not, independently verify the accuracy or completeness of any of the\ninformation provided to CSCA, nor did it express any opinion with respect thereto. CSCA relied upon the assurances\nof the management of Monmouth that management is not aware of any information or facts that would make the\ninformation provided or otherwise made available to CSCA incomplete, materially inaccurate, or misleading. CSCA did\nnot perform any independent evaluation, valuation, audit or appraisal of assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise,\nincluding contractual rights or obligations), or physical inspection of any assets, of Monmouth, and CSCA did not\nattempt to assess or value any of the intangible assets of Monmouth\u037e nor did CSCA obtain nor was CSCA furnished\nwith any such valuations, audits or appraisals. In addition, CSCA did not evaluate, or obtain the evaluations of, the\nsolvency or fair value of Monmouth under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar\nmatters. CSCA expressed no opinion as to the prices at which shares of Monmouth Common Stock would trade\nfollowing the announcement of the Merger.\nFor the purposes of its analyses and review, CSCA made numerous assumptions based on its judgment and\nexperience and without seeking independent verification with respect to industry performance, general business,\neconomic, market and financial conditions and other matters, any of which are beyond the control of Monmouth or\nany other parties to the Merger Agreement. The analyses performed by CSCA are not necessarily indicative of actual\nvalues or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses.\nCSCA did not express any opinion with respect to any alternatives to the Merger or other strategic alternatives that\nmay be available to Monmouth or otherwise. CSCA\u2019s opinion also did not address the merits of the underlying\ndecision by Monmouth to engage in the Merger or the manner in which to effect the Merger or the relative merits of\nits decision not to proceed with any alternative strategies or transactions that may be available to Monmouth.\nFurther, CSCA was not engaged to, and did not, independently assess or consider, and its opinion does not address,\nany tax, regulatory, legal, and accounting matters relating to the Merger Agreement and the disclosure schedules\nthereto, the Merger, or the consequences of the Merger on Monmouth, or any shareholder of Monmouth.\nCSCA\u2019s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Monmouth\nCommon Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock in\nthe Merger and no opinion or view was expressed by CSCA with respect to any consideration received in connection\nwith the Merger by the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In\naddition, no opinion or view was expressed by CSCA with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the\namount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officer, director, or employee of any party to the\nMerger, or class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Monmouth\nCommon Stock.\nCSCA\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on CSCA\u2019s assessment of economic, market, financial, regulatory and other\nconditions and circumstances as they existed as the date of its opinion, November 4, 2021, and which could be\nevaluated, and the information made available to CSCA, on and as of the date of the opinion. CSCA does not have\nany obligation and accepted no responsibility to update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion for subsequent developments\nwhich may affect its opinion and it expressly disclaimed any responsibility to do so. CSCA is not required to update\nits opinion as a consequence of any changes in projections, financial information, Monmouth\u2019s performance, or other\ncircumstances.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn arriving at its opinion, CSCA did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered by\nit but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all\nother analyses performed and factors considered by it and in the context of the circumstances of the particular\ntransaction. Accordingly, CSCA believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole, as considering any portion\nof such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by\nCSCA in preparing its opinion to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors. The summary of CSCA\u2019s analyses and reviews\nprovided below is not a complete description of the analyses and reviews underlying its opinion.\nFor the purposes of its analyses and review, CSCA made numerous assumptions based on various quantitative and\nqualitative judgments and determinations, and without seeking independent verification, with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are\nbeyond the control of Monmouth or any other parties to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement and the adaptation and application of these methods to the unique facts and circumstances\npresented. No company, business, or transaction considered in CSCA\u2019s analyses and review is identical to\nMonmouth or the Merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely mathematical.\nRather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating\ncharacteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading, or other values of the companies,\nbusinesses, or transactions considered in CSCA\u2019s analyses and reviews. None of Monmouth, CSCA, or any other\nperson assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained\nin these analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or\nless favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of companies, businesses or\nsecurities do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the companies, businesses, or securities may\nactually be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, CSCA\u2019s analyses and reviews are\ninherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nThe summary of the financial analyses and reviews summarized below include information presented in tabular\nformat. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses. In order to fully understand the\nfinancial analyses and reviews used by CSCA, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the\ntables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses and reviews. Considering the data in\nthe tables below without considering the full description of the analyses and reviews, including the methodologies\nand assumptions underlying the analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view of CSCA\u2019s\nanalyses and reviews. Accordingly, CSCA believes that its analyses and the following summary must be considered\nas a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, methodologies and factors, without considering all analyses,\nmethodologies and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying CSCA\u2019s\nanalyses and opinion.\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by CSCA in connection with the preparation\nof its opinion and reviewed with Monmouth\u2019s board of directors on November 4, 2021. The order of the analyses\ndoes not represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by CSCA.\nFor the purposes of each of the following analyses, CSCA compared the results of each analysis to the Merger\nConsideration to be received by holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock in the Merger.\nSelected Comparable Companies Analysis. CSCA performed a selected comparable companies analysis with respect\nto Monmouth in which CSCA reviewed and compared financial and operating data relating to Monmouth and the\nselected publicly-traded companies listed below.\nIn performing the selected comparable companies analysis with respect to Monmouth, CSCA reviewed financial and\noperating data for publicly-traded, internally-managed REITs with significant concentrations of single-tenant\nindustrial properties that CSCA, based on its experience in the REIT industry, deemed comparable to Monmouth (the\n\u201cIndustrial Peer Group\u201d).\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe selected comparable companies with respect to Monmouth were:\n\u2022\nW.P.

CSCA reviewed and compared the purchase prices and financial multiples\npaid in selected other transactions that CSCA, based on its experience with merger and acquisition transactions,\ndeemed relevant. CSCA chose such transactions with a focus on U.S. target companies based on, among other\nthings, the similarity of the applicable target companies in the transactions to Monmouth including, but not limited\nto, concentrations of single-tenant industrial or other analogous assets. CSCA reviewed the following transactions:\nDate Announced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nImplied Cash \nCapitalization Rate\nAugust 2021\nBlackstone Real Estate Income Trust\nWPT Industrial Real Estate\nInvestment Trust\n4.2%\nMay 2018\nThe Blackstone Group LP\nGramercy Property Trust\n6.1%\nJuly 2015\nGlobal Logistic Properties Limited\nIndustrial Income Trust Inc.\n5.1%\nThe reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed were\ndiverse and there are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of each of\nMonmouth and the companies included in the selected precedent transaction analysis. CSCA noted that based on\ncertain attributes, including the ownership of single-tenant assets and certain similar operating markets, Industrial\nIncome Trust Inc. (\u201cIIT\u201d) and WPT Industrial REIT (\u201cWPT\u201d) may be considered comparable to Monmouth, whereas\nbased on certain other attributes including, but not limited to, the ownership of multi-tenant assets and in-house\ndevelopment functions, IIT and WPT may not be considered comparable to Monmouth. Although none of the\nselected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger and while there may be other precedent transactions that\nmay be considered comparable, the target companies in the selected transactions were companies that, for purposes\nof analysis, may be considered similar to Monmouth.\nAccordingly, for the above selected transactions, based on information from public filings and FactSet that CSCA, in\nits judgment, determined were relevant, CSCA calculated and reviewed the implied cash capitalization rates paid in\nsuch transactions. The following table sets forth the results of such analysis:\nPrecedent Transactions\nMean\nHigh\nLow\nImplied Cash Capitalization Rate\n5.2%\n4.2%\n6.1%\nCSCA applied the range of implied cash capitalization rates from the selected precedent transactions to Monmouth\u2019s\npro forma cash NOI to calculate the range of implied gross real estate values.

In performing the capitalization rate valuation analysis with respect to\nMonmouth, CSCA utilized a range of property-level cash capitalization rates selected by CSCA and informed from a\nvariety of sources including, but not limited to, the Industrial Peer Group, precedent transactions and industry\nresearch, among other sources. An estimated range of real estate values was calculated by applying a range of cash\ncapitalization rates from 4.50% to 5.25% to Monmouth\u2019s pro forma cash NOI, as provided by\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMonmouth management.

CSCA performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to Monmouth by\ncalculating the estimated present value as of September 30, 2021 of (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for\nMonmouth from October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2026, as reflected in Monmouth management forecasts\ndescribed under \u201cThe Merger-Summary of Certain Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information-\nMonmouth Multi-Year Projected Cash Flows\u201d and (ii) a range of terminal values of Monmouth based on annualized\nEBITDA excluding dividend and interest income and straight-line rent as of December 2026, all of which were\ndiscussed with, and approved by, Monmouth for use by CSCA in its analysis. For purposes of its analysis, CSCA\nutilized a range of discount rates from 6.00% to 6.50%, which CSCA derived utilizing the capital asset pricing model\nwhich requires certain company-specific inputs, including Monmouth\u2019s capital structure weightings, the cost of long-\nterm debt, and a beta for Monmouth, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets\ngenerally. The estimated terminal value of Monmouth was calculated by applying a selected range of EBITDA\nmultiples of 20.0x to 23.0x, selected by CSCA based in part on the historical EBITDA trading multiples of the\nIndustrial Peer Group and in part on CSCA\u2019s professional judgment.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCSCA derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Monmouth by adding the ranges of present values it\nderived as described above. The range of resulting enterprise values CSCA derived for Monmouth were then\nadjusted for balance sheet items, including subtracting net debt (defined as debt less cash), adding securities\nholdings and subtracting preferred equity, to calculate implied equity values per share. The following table sets forth\nthe results of such analyses.\nTerminal Value Range\nDiscount Rate\nImplied Equity \nValue Per Share\n20.0 x - 23.0 x\n6.00% - 6.50%\n$15.06 - $20.65\nCSCA then compared the implied equity values per share for Monmouth to the Merger Consideration.\nLow\nHigh\nMerger \nConsideration\nMonmouth Implied Equity Value Per Share\n$15.06\n$20.65\n$21.00\nCSCA noted that on the basis of the discounted cash flow analysis, the Merger Consideration was above the range\nof the Monmouth implied equity values per share.\nOther Factors. CSCA also reviewed and considered other factors, which were not considered part of its financial\nanalyses in connection with rendering its advice, but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among\nother things, the Historical Trading Analysis described below.\nHistorical Trading Analysis. CSCA reviewed historical trading prices of a share of Monmouth Common Stock for the\n52-week period ended as of the Unaffected Date, noting the range of low to high closing prices of $8.97 to $17.10.\nCSCA also noted that over the 12-month and 6-month periods up to the Unaffected Date, shares of Monmouth\nCommon Stock traded at volume weighted average prices of $13.81 and $14.59, respectively. CSCA further noted that\nfollowing the Unaffected Date, through November 3, 2021, shares of Monmouth Common Stock traded within a range\nof low to high closing prices of $16.23 to $19.65.\nGeneral. The Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Monmouth and\nILPT and was approved by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors. CSCA provided advice to Monmouth during these\nnegotiations. CSCA did not, however, recommend any specific merger consideration to Monmouth or its board of\ndirectors or that any specific merger consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nAs described above, CSCA\u2019s opinion to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement.\nCSCA is a recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged\nin the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for\npassive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and\nunlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes from which conflicting\ninterest or duties, or a perception thereof, may arise. CSCA was selected to advise Monmouth with respect to the\nMerger and deliver an opinion to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among\nother things, CSCA\u2019s substantial experience in the REIT industry and Monmouth\u2019s long-standing relationship with\nCSCA.\nCSCA is acting as non-exclusive financial advisor to Monmouth in connection with the Merger and will receive a\nnon-contingent fee from Monmouth for its services of $1.0 million which became payable upon the delivery of\nCSCA\u2019s opinion (in addition to the $2.0 million of fees paid to CSCA for the delivery of CSCA\u2019s prior opinions in\nconnection with the now-terminated transaction with EQC). In addition, Monmouth has agreed to reimburse CSCA\nfor certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and indemnify CSCA for certain liabilities that may arise out of its\nengagement by Monmouth and the rendering of CSCA\u2019s opinion. Pursuant to the terms of the engagement, CSCA\nmay be paid additional fees at CSCA\u2019s standard hourly rates for any time incurred should CSCA be called upon to\nsupport its findings or provide further services related to its opinion subsequent to the delivery of its opinion. CSCA\nwill also receive a success fee, which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger, equal to 0.70% of the\ntransaction value, which is estimated to be approximately $14.5 million. The prior opinion fees paid to CSCA will be\nfully credited against the success fee, and the opinion fee with respect to this transaction will be 50% credited\nagainst the success fee. Pursuant to a separate advisory agreement with\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMonmouth dated December 8, 2020, CSCA has received and will receive quarterly advisory fees from Monmouth until\nsuch agreement is terminated. In the two years preceding the date of its opinion, CSCA has provided certain financial\nadvisory services for Monmouth, having received approximately $2.2 million for such services. In the two years\npreceding the date of its opinion, CSCA has not provided any investment banking or advisory services to ILPT or\nRMR. CSCA may in the future provide investment banking and advisory services to ILPT or RMR for which it may\nreceive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses.",

            "text": "Summary of Certain Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nWhile Monmouth has from time to time provided limited guidance to investors in its regular earnings press releases\nand other investor materials with respect to certain financial results and operational metrics for the then-current fiscal\nyear, Monmouth has not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections as to future\nperformance, earnings or results of operations due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and\nsubjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the evaluation of the now-\nterminated transaction with EQC, prior to the execution of the merger agreement for such transaction, Monmouth\nmanagement prepared and provided to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, and to Monmouth\u2019s financial advisors, J.P.\nMorgan and CSCA, for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses and opinions in\nconnection with the now-terminated transaction with EQC, certain nonpublic, internal financial projections regarding\nMonmouth\u2019s future operations for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2021, September 30, 2022, September 30,\n2023, September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2025, and for the calendar years ending December 31, 2021, December 31,\n2022, December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025 (the \u201cprior Monmouth multi-year projected\nfinancial information\u201d). In connection with the evaluation of the Merger, prior to the execution of the Merger\nAgreement, Monmouth management extended the prior Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to the\nfiscal year ending September 30, 2026 and the calendar year ending December 31, 2026 and revised the projected\nfinancial information to reflect certain updated assumptions for such financial projections as a result of the passage\nof time since the preparation of the prior Monmouth multi-year projected financial information, including a delay in\nthe pace of acquisitions, reduced capitalization rates on acquisitions, reduced financing costs, and elimination of new\npreferred equity issuance (such extended and updated projections, the \u201cMonmouth multi-year projected financial\ninformation\u201d) and provided the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to Monmouth\u2019s board of\ndirectors and to J.P. Morgan and CSCA, for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial\nanalyses and opinions in connection with the Merger. As described below, the Monmouth multi-year projected\nfinancial information was also made available to ILPT and its financial advisor, as well as certain other prospective\ncounterparties who entered into a non-disclosure agreement as part of the process. For more information, see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger-Opinions of Monmouth\u2019s Financial Advisors.\u201d Monmouth has included below a\nsummary of the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information for the purpose of providing shareholders and\ninvestors access to certain nonpublic information that was furnished to J.P. Morgan, CSCA and Monmouth\u2019s board\nof directors in connection with the Merger. Such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not\nincluded to influence your voting decision with respect to the proposals set forth in this proxy statement to be voted\non by Monmouth shareholders. The inclusion of this summary should not be regarded as an indication that\nMonmouth management or anyone who received the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information then\nconsidered, or now considers, it to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the Monmouth multi-year projected\nfinancial information should not be relied upon as such. This information is not fact and readers of this proxy\nstatement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information.\nThe Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, and\ndoes not necessarily comply with published guidelines established by the SEC or by the American Institute of\nCertified Public Accountants for preparation and presentations of financial projections, but in the view of Monmouth\nmanagement, was prepared on a reasonable basis and reflects the assumptions and estimates available at the time the\nMonmouth multi-year projected financial information was prepared. The Monmouth multi-year projected financial\ninformation involves significant estimates and assumptions that make it inherently less comparable to the similarly\ntitled GAAP measures in Monmouth\u2019s historical GAAP financial statements. The Monmouth multi-year projected\nfinancial information included in this section of the proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility\nof, Monmouth management. Neither PKF O\u2019Connor Davies, LLP (\u201cPKF\u201d), Monmouth\u2019s independent registered public\naccounting firm, nor any other independent accountant has examined, compiled or performed any procedures with\nrespect to the Monmouth multi-year\n49TABLE OF CONTENTS\nprojected financial information or any assumptions underlying the Monmouth multi-year projected financial\ninformation and, accordingly, PKF does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the Monmouth\nmulti-year projected financial information or its achievability, and assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any\nassociation with respect to, the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information or the assumptions underlying\nthe Monmouth multi-year projected financial information. The report of PKF contained in Monmouth\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, which is incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement, relates to Monmouth\u2019s historical financial information and does not extend to the Monmouth multi-year\nprojected financial information or any other prospective financial information. Furthermore, the Monmouth multi-year\nprojected financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was\nprepared.\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was based on\nnumerous variables and assumptions (including assumptions related to industry performance and general business,\neconomic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Monmouth\u2019s business) that are\ninherently subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of Monmouth management. Important factors that\nmay affect actual results and cause the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to not be achieved\ninclude, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Monmouth\u2019s business (including Monmouth\u2019s\nability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and other factors described in the\nsections of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the\nrisks described in the periodic reports filed by Monmouth with the SEC, which reports can be found as described\nunder \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d The Monmouth multi-year projected financial information also\nreflects numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time the Monmouth multi-year projected\nfinancial information was prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual\nresults may differ materially from those contained in the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Monmouth\nshareholders are urged to review the most recent SEC filings of Monmouth for a description of the reported and\nanticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital resources, including in \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Monmouth\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are\nincorporated by reference into this proxy statement.\nThe inclusion of a summary of the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information in this proxy statement\nshould not be regarded as an indication that Monmouth or its officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other\nrepresentatives considered the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to necessarily be predictive of\nactual future events, and the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information should not be relied upon as such\nnor should the information contained in the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information be considered\nappropriate for other purposes. None of Monmouth or its officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other\nrepresentatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Monmouth multi-\nyear projected financial information.\nMONMOUTH DOES NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE OR RECONCILE THE MONMOUTH\nMULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE\nDATE THE MONMOUTH MULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION WAS PREPARED OR TO\nREFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE\nASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE MONMOUTH MULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ARE\nNO LONGER APPROPRIATE. SINCE THE MONMOUTH MULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nCOVERS MULTIPLE YEARS, SUCH INFORMATION BY ITS NATURE BECOMES LESS PREDICTIVE WITH EACH\nSUCCESSIVE YEAR.\nMonmouth may calculate certain non-GAAP financial metrics, including NOI, EBITDA, FFO and AFFO (each as\ndefined below), using methodologies different from those used by other companies. Consequently, the financial\nmetrics presented in Monmouth\u2019s prospective financial information disclosures and in the sections of this proxy\nstatement with respect to the opinions of the financial advisors to Monmouth may not be directly comparable to\nthose of other companies.\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMonmouth has not made and makes no representation to any Monmouth shareholder in the Merger Agreement or\notherwise concerning the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information or regarding Monmouth\u2019s ultimate\nperformance compared to the information contained in the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information or\nthat the projected results will be achieved.\nMonmouth Multi-Year Projected Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth selected unaudited prospective financial information representing Monmouth\nmanagement\u2019s evaluation of Monmouth\u2019s estimated standalone future financial performance based on an internal\nfinancial model that Monmouth has historically used in connection with its annual budgeting and strategic planning\nprocess. The following Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was finalized on October 14, 2021. The\nMonmouth multi-year projected financial information was based on numerous variables and assumptions, including\nthe variables and assumptions discussed above, as well as the following material assumptions: (1) Cash NOI,\nAdjusted EBITDA (ex. Interest/Dividend Income), FFO and AFFO per share (each as defined below) projections\nbased on Monmouth\u2019s business plan for 2022 through 2026\u037e (2) acquisitions at initial cash capitalization rates of 4.5%\nto 5.9%\u037e (3) general and administrative expense at approximately 5% of total income\u037e (4) new debt issued at an\ninterest rate ranging from approximately 1.6% to 2.75%\u037e and (5) AFFO payout ratio at approximately 75% or higher.\nThe Monmouth multi-year projected financial information does not give effect to the Merger. The Monmouth multi-\nyear projected financial information was provided to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors and to J.P. Morgan, CSCA, and\nILPT, and a summary is presented in the following table, with all figures rounded to the nearest million, except per\nshare data. Monmouth\u2019s management directed J.P. Morgan and CSCA to use and rely upon the Monmouth multi-year\nprojected financial information for purposes of their respective opinions and related financial analyses.

The components of NOI consist of recurring rental and reimbursement revenue, less real estate taxes\nand operating expenses, such as insurance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. Monmouth defines Cash NOI as NOI as adjusted\nto exclude the impact of certain GAAP adjustments included in rental revenue, such as straight-line rent adjustments and\namortization of above-market intangible lease assets and below-market lease intangible liabilities.\n(2)\nMonmouth defines adjusted EBITDA (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d) as Net Income (Loss), as such term is defined under GAAP,\nattributable to Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders, plus preferred dividend expense, interest expense, including amortization of\nfinancing costs, depreciation, amortization of capitalized lease costs and intangible assets, non-recurring strategic alternatives and\nproxy costs (including litigation and certain other non-routine costs) and unrealized holding losses arising during the relevant\nperiod, less gain on sale of securities transactions and gain on sale of real estate investments. The Adjusted EBITDA item set\nforth in the tables above also excludes interest and dividend income.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(3)\nMonmouth defines funds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) as such term is defined by The National Association of Real Estate\nInvestment Trusts (Nareit). Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common shareholders, as defined under GAAP,\nexcluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real\nestate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. Included in the Nareit FFO\nWhite Paper - 2018 Restatement, is an option pertaining to assets incidental to our main business in the calculation of Nareit\nFFO to make an election to include or exclude mark-to-market changes in the value recognized on these marketable equity\nsecurities. In conjunction with the adoption of the FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, for all periods presented, Monmouth\nhas elected to exclude unrealized gains and losses from its investments in marketable equity securities from our FFO calculation.\nNareit created FFO as a non-GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance.\n(4)\nMonmouth defines adjusted funds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) as FFO as adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense,\ndepreciation of corporate office tenant improvements, amortization of deferred financing costs, gains on the sale of securities,\nlease termination income, non-recurring costs relating to Monmouth\u2019s strategic alternative process and proxy fight (including\nlitigation and certain other non-routine costs), effect of non-cash GAAP straight-line rent adjustments and less recurring capital\nexpenditures. Recurring capital expenditures are defined as all capital expenditures that are recurring in nature, excluding capital\nexpenditures related to expansions at Monmouth\u2019s existing properties or capital expenditures that are incurred in conjunction\nwith obtaining a new lease or a lease renewal.\nIn addition to the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information described above, Monmouth management\nprovided to J.P. Morgan and CSCA, for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses\nand opinions, unaudited unlevered free cash flow projections for Monmouth on a standalone basis for the three-\nmonths ending December 31, 2021, and for the calendar years ending December 31, 2022, December 31, 2023,\nDecember 31, 2024, December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2026 (\u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow\u201d).

Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was aware of those interests and considered\nthem, among other matters, in reaching its decision to approve the execution of the Merger Agreement and in making\nits recommendation that Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders vote to approve the Merger. These interests include the\ninterests described below in this section. The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement will constitute a \u201cchange in control,\u201d \u201cchange of control\u201d or term of similar meaning for purposes of\nMonmouth\u2019s executive compensation arrangements, including the benefit plans and agreements described below.\nDirectors and Executive Officers\nThe following table lists Monmouth\u2019s directors and executive officers:\nName\nPositions\nKiernan Conway\nIndependent Director\nDaniel D.

Robinson\nIndependent Director\n53TABLE OF CONTENTS\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payment and benefits described in\nthis section, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe relevant price per share of Monmouth Common Stock is $21.00, which is the Merger Consideration\u037e\n\u2022\nThe Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on December 20, 2021, which is the assumed date of\nthe Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe employment of each executive officer was terminated by Monmouth without \u201ccause\u201d or due to the\nexecutive officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and\nagreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on the assumed date of the Effective Time\nof December 20, 2021.\nThe amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be\naccurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation\nactions that may occur before completion of the Merger.\nTreatment of Monmouth\u2019s Equity Awards\nStock Options\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each stock option issued pursuant to Monmouth\u2019s\nequity incentive plan, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled and the holder thereof will become entitled to\nreceive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect to such stock option, an amount in cash equal to\nthe excess of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such stock option, multiplied\nby the number of shares of Monmouth Common Stock subject to such stock option, subject to any applicable\nwithholding tax.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each unvested restricted stock award issued pursuant to\nMonmouth\u2019s equity incentive plan will be canceled and the holder thereof will then become entitled to receive, in full\nsatisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect to such award, an amount in cash equal to the Merger\nConsideration in respect of each restricted share covered by such restricted stock award, plus accumulated and\nunpaid dividends with respect to such stock award, subject to any applicable withholding tax.\nValue of Outstanding Equity Awards\nSee the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Monmouth\u2019s Executive Officers\u201d for\nan estimate of the value of each of Monmouth\u2019s named executive officer\u2019s unvested equity awards. Based on the\nassumptions described above under \u201cThe Merger-Interests of Monmouth\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the\nMerger-Certain Assumptions,\u201d the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable at the Effective Time to\nMonmouth\u2019s ten non-employee directors in respect of their unvested restricted stock awards granted prior to the\ndate of the Merger Agreement is $37,000.\nFor more information on the equity holdings of Monmouth\u2019s directors and executive officers, see the table entitled\n\u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.\u201d\nDirectors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Indemnification and Insurance\nIn connection with the Merger, Monmouth\u2019s directors and officers will receive certain insurance and indemnification\nunder the Merger Agreement. For specific terms thereof, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Employees, Directors, and\nOfficers-Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Indemnification and Insurance.\u201d\nDirector Arrangements\nPrior to the Closing, Monmouth may pay to each non-employee director a cash payment equal to the director fees\nthat such non-employee director would have received for the period from the Closing through December 31, 2022 had\nthe Closing not occurred. Based on the assumptions described above under \u201cThe Merger-Interests of Monmouth\u2019s\nExecutive Officers and Directors in the Merger-Certain Assumptions,\u201d the aggregate amount of such cash payments\nfor Monmouth\u2019s ten non-employee directors would be $546,000.\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nManagement Arrangements\nTransaction Success Program\nIn connection with the Merger, Monmouth intends to establish a cash retention program for employees in an\naggregate amount that, taken together with any Closing director compensation payments (see \u201cThe Merger-Interests\nof Monmouth\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger-Director Arrangements\u201d above), does not exceed $3\nmillion to promote retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate the Merger (the \u201cTransaction Success\nProgram\u201d). Awards under the Transaction Success Program will be allocated by Michael Landy or his designee (or,\nfor an award to an executive officer, by the compensation committee of Monmouth's board of directors) and will vest\nupon the Effective Time, subject to the participant\u2019s continued service with Monmouth through the Effective Time,\nand be paid within 30 days after the Effective Time. Employees (including executive officers) will be eligible to receive\nawards under such program, but the recipients of such awards and their respective award amounts have not yet been\ndetermined as of the date of this proxy statement.\nEmployment Arrangements\nMonmouth is party to employment agreements with each of Eugene Landy, Michael Landy, and Kevin Miller that\nprovide certain benefits upon termination of employment in connection with a change in control (which would\ninclude the Merger). It is expected that the employment of each of Eugene Landy, Michael Landy and Kevin Miller\nwill terminate at the Effective Time and such termination will, in the case of Messrs. Landy, Landy, and Miller, entitle\nsuch executive officer to receive the change in control related severance benefits described below.\nEugene Landy. Upon any termination of Eugene Landy\u2019s employment for any reason, Mr. Landy\u2019s employment\nagreement provides for aggregate termination payments of $500,000, payable to Mr. Landy in installments of $100,000\nper year for five years. In addition, upon the termination of Mr. Landy\u2019s employment, following, or as a result of,\ncertain types of transactions that lead to a significant increase in Monmouth\u2019s market capitalization, the employment\nagreement provides that Mr. Landy is entitled to receive a grant of between 35,000 and 65,000 shares of Monmouth\nCommon Stock, depending on the amount of the increase in Monmouth\u2019s market capitalization. It has been\ndetermined that this provision will result in Mr. Landy receiving a grant of 50,000 shares of Monmouth Common\nStock in connection with the termination of his employment as a result of the Merger. Such shares will be cancelled in\nthe Merger in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. In addition, if Mr. Landy\u2019s employment terminates\nfollowing, or as a result of, any such transaction, his employment agreement provides that all of his outstanding\noptions to purchase shares of Monmouth Common Stock will become immediately vested, and he will be entitled to\ncontinue to receive benefits under Monmouth\u2019s health insurance and similar plans for one year. In the event of a\nchange in control, Mr. Landy is also entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $2,500,000, provided that the sale price\nis at least $10 per share of Monmouth Common Stock. All compensatory payments are subject to applicable\nwithholding tax.\nMichael Landy. Upon a termination of Michael Landy\u2019s employment without \u201ccause\u201d or by Mr. Landy for \u201cgood\nreason\u201d, Mr. Landy\u2019s employment agreement provides that his severance package will consist of his base salary as in\neffect immediately prior to his termination plus his Annual Cash Bonus Target (as defined in the employment\nagreement) for the remaining term of the agreement (inclusive of any renewals), plus the cost of medical, dental\nand/or vision benefit coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, also referred to\nas COBRA, for up to 18 months after his termination of employment for Mr. Landy (and his spouse and eligible\ndependents who were covered immediately prior to Mr. Landy\u2019s termination of employment). The agreement further\nprovides that if Mr. Landy remains employed through a \u201cchange of control\u201d, his employment agreement is treated as\nautomatically renewed for three years from the date of the change of control and if his employment with Monmouth is\nterminated either by Monmouth without \u201ccause\u201d or by Mr. Landy for \u201cgood reason\u201d, within 18 months after a change\nof control, then, and in addition to the payments of base salary and Annual Cash Bonus Target, all of Mr. Landy\u2019s\nunvested and outstanding equity awards will automatically vest effective immediately prior to such termination of\nemployment. Mr. Landy is also entitled to participate in the Transaction Success Program in accordance with its\nterms, however, no award has been allocated to Mr. Landy as of the date of this proxy statement. All compensatory\npayments are subject to applicable withholding tax.\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nKevin Miller. Upon a termination of Kevin Miller\u2019s employment without \u201ccause\u201d or by Mr. Miller for \u201cgood reason\u201d,\nMr. Miller\u2019s employment agreement provides that he will be entitled to the greater of the base salary due under the\nremaining term of the agreement or one year\u2019s base salary as of the date of termination, paid monthly over the\nremaining term of the agreement. In the event of a merger, sale or change of voting control (with certain limited\nexceptions), Mr. Miller has the right to extend and renew his employment agreement so that the expiration date will be\nthree years from the date of the merger, sale or change of voting control. As a result of the Merger, Mr. Miller will be\nentitled to extend and renew his employment agreement. Following the Merger, if Mr. Miller\u2019s employment were to\nterminate without cause or if he were to elect to terminate his employment for \u201cgood reason\u201d, the termination of Mr.\nMiller\u2019s employment would result in the payment of the aforementioned benefits. After the signing of the Merger\nAgreement, Monmouth amended and restated Mr. Miller\u2019s employment agreement, which, among other things,\nprovided that (i) Mr. Miller\u2019s annual base salary for calendar year 2022 will be $700,000, (ii) a diminution or adverse\nchange in Mr. Miller\u2019s title, without his consent, will constitute \u201cgood reason\u201d, and (iii) Mr. Miller\u2019s severance\nbenefits upon a qualifying termination will be equal to his base salary as in effect immediately prior to the qualifying\ntermination of employment plus his annual target bonus for the greater of (x) the remainder of the term as extended\nabove (but in no event greater than three years) and (y) one year, and the payment of the cost of COBRA benefits for\nup to 18 months. Mr. Miller is also entitled to participate in the Transaction Success Program in accordance with its\nterms, however, no award has been allocated to Mr. Miller as of the date of this proxy statement. All compensatory\npayments are subject to applicable withholding tax.\nChange in Control Severance Plan\nEach of Monmouth\u2019s executive officers and employees, other than Eugene Landy, Michael Landy, and Kevin Miller,\nparticipates in the Change in Control Severance Plan that was adopted by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors in January\n2021 (the \u201cCIC Plan\u201d). Pursuant to the CIC Plan, upon a termination of employment without \u201ccause\u201d within twelve\nmonths following the Effective Time, each participating employee (including Messrs. Prashad and Molke, our two\nexecutive officers who participate in the CIC Plan) would be entitled to receive a lump-sum cash payment, net of\napplicable withholding tax, in an amount equal to two times the employee\u2019s annual base salary and payment or\nreimbursement of premiums for healthcare continuation coverage under COBRA for such employee and such\nemployee\u2019s dependents for so long as they remain eligible for such coverage or until they obtain other healthcare\ncoverage, if earlier. In the event it is not possible to provide COBRA coverage on a subsidized basis, the employee\nwould receive a lump sum equal to the value of such subsidy, as reasonably determined, assuming that the applicable\nemployee remained eligible for 18 months of COBRA coverage. The employee\u2019s receipt of severance is subject to the\nexecution and non-revocation of a general release of claims, and compliance with a customary non-disparagement\ncovenant relating to the employer and its affiliates. It is expected that each of Monmouth\u2019s employees will be\nterminated as of immediately after the Effective Time in a severance eligible manner, and as such, it is expected that\neach participant in the CIC Plan will be entitled to the severance benefits described above.\nBetter Net After-Tax Cutback\nTo the extent that any payments or benefits that Eugene Landy, Michael Landy and Kevin Miller are or become\nentitled to receive in connection with the Merger would constitute a \u201cparachute payment\u201d for purposes of Section\n280G of the Code and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, Monmouth anticipates\nworking with the applicable executive officer to mitigate such excise tax exposure (including, where appropriate,\naccelerating vesting and/or payments into 2021). And, if the tax exposure cannot be entirely mitigated, Monmouth\nexpects that each such executive officer would either (i) accept the aggregate payments and benefits without any\ncutback and with the application of the excise tax or (ii) accept a lesser amount that would result in no portion of the\naggregate payments and benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever would result in the receipt by the\nexecutive officer of the greatest amount of aggregate payments and benefits on an after-tax basis.",

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders\nof Monmouth Common Stock. The following discussion is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury Regulations\npromulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d),\nand judicial decisions and interpretations of the foregoing, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement.\nThese authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may change, possibly with retroactive effect, and any\nsuch differing interpretation or change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein.\nThis discussion assumes that the Merger will be completed in accordance with the Merger Agreement and as further\ndescribed in this proxy statement. This discussion is for general information purposes only, is not a complete\ndescription of all of the tax consequences of the Merger and, in particular, does not address any tax reporting\nrequirements, tax consequences arising under the unearned Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care\nand Education Act of 2010, any considerations with respect to FATCA (which for this purpose means Sections 1471\nthrough 1474 of the Code, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any intergovernmental agreements\nentered into in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such\nagreement) or any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction, or under any\nU.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to income tax. In addition, this discussion is not binding on the IRS or\nany court, and no assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position\ncontrary to any statement or conclusion set forth in this discussion.\nThe following discussion applies only to holders of Monmouth Common Stock who hold such stock as capital assets\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further,\n58TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthis discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to\nholders in light of their particular circumstances and does not apply to holders subject to special treatment under the\nU.S. federal income tax laws (such as, for example, banks and certain other financial institutions, tax-exempt\norganizations, partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities (or investors in partnerships, S\ncorporations or other pass-through entities), regulated investment companies, controlled foreign corporations,\npassive foreign investment companies, real estate investment trusts, insurance companies, mutual funds, dealers or\nbrokers in stocks and securities, commodities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market\nmethod of accounting, holders who are required to recognize income or gain no later than such income or gain is\nrequired to be reported on an applicable financial statement under Section 451(b) of the Code, holders subject to the\nalternative minimum tax provisions of the Code, \u201cqualified foreign pension funds\u201d (within the meaning of Section\n897(l)(2) of the Code) or entities all of the interests in which are held by a qualified pension fund, \u201cqualified\nshareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) or investors therein, non-U.S. holders (as defined\nbelow) who hold, or have held at any time, directly, indirectly, or constructively, more than 10% of the Monmouth\nCommon Stock outstanding (except to the extent specifically set forth below) or more than 10% of the Monmouth\nPreferred Stock outstanding, holders who acquired Monmouth Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of employee\nstock options, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation, U.S. holders (as defined below)\nwhose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, holders who hold Monmouth Common Stock as part of a hedge,\nstraddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, or U.S. expatriates).\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Monmouth Common Stock that is\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or\nentity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, organized in or under the laws of the United\nStates or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) a trust if (a) a court within the United States is able to\nexercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (as defined\nunder the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) such trust has made a valid\nelection to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (iv) an estate, the income of\nwhich is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source. As used herein, the\nterm \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Monmouth Common Stock that is not a U.S. holder or an entity or\narrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf an entity or an arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Monmouth\nCommon Stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of such partnership or a partner in such partnership generally\nwill depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any entity treated as a partnership for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Monmouth Common Stock and any partners in such partnership are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Merger to their specific circumstances.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, IS NOT TAX ADVICE, AND IS NOT\nINTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF ALL TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO\nTHE MERGER. EACH HOLDER OF MONMOUTH COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX\nADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO SUCH\nHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS WITH RESPECT TO ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF\nTHE MERGER ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT OR OTHER TAX LAWS OR UNDER THE\nLAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-UNITED STATES TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY\nAPPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY, OR ANY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND ANY PENDING\nOR PROPOSED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Merger Generally\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties will treat the Merger as a taxable sale by Monmouth of all of\nMonmouth\u2019s assets to ILPT in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the Preferred Stock Consideration, the\nassumption of all of Monmouth\u2019s liabilities and any other applicable amounts, followed immediately by the\ndistribution of such Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock Consideration (and any other applicable amounts) to\nthe holders of equity interests in Monmouth in complete liquidation of Monmouth pursuant to Revenue Ruling 69-6,\n1969-1 C.B. 104, Section 331(a) of the Code and Section 562(b)(1) of the Code. Because, as a REIT,\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMonmouth is entitled to receive a deduction for liquidating distributions, and Monmouth anticipates that its deemed\nliquidating distribution will exceed its taxable income recognized as a result of the Merger (together with any other\nundistributed taxable income recognized in the taxable year of the Merger), Monmouth anticipates that it will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nConsequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Monmouth Common Stock\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for their Monmouth Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of Monmouth Common Stock that\nreceives cash in exchange for its shares of Monmouth Common Stock in the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an\namount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received (determined before the deduction of\nany applicable withholding taxes, as described below under \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger-Information Reporting and Backup Withholding\u201d) and (2) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted\ntax basis in such shares. Any such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain\nor loss if such U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in its Monmouth Common Stock surrendered in the Merger is more than\none year as of the date of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals,\nare generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to\nlimitations.\nIf a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Monmouth Common Stock at different times and different prices, such\nU.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each\nblock of Monmouth Common Stock.\nA U.S. holder who has held Monmouth Common Stock for six months or less at the time of the Merger, taking into\naccount the holding period rules of Sections 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who recognizes a loss on the\nexchange of such Monmouth Common Stock in the Merger will generally be treated as recognizing a long-term capital\nloss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received from Monmouth, or such holder\u2019s share of any designated\nretained capital gains, with respect to such Monmouth Common Stock.\nConsequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Monmouth Common Stock\nA non-U.S. holder\u2019s gain or loss from the Merger will generally be determined in the same manner as that of a U.S.\nholder. Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below under \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger-Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,\u201d a non-U.S. holder generally should\nnot be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain or loss from the receipt of the cash in exchange for Monmouth\nCommon Stock pursuant to the Merger, except as described below.\nGain recognized by a non-U.S. holder upon a sale or exchange of shares of Monmouth Common Stock pursuant to\nthe Merger generally will not be taxed under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (\u201cFIRPTA\u201d) if\nMonmouth is a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity,\u201d defined generally to include a REIT, less than\n50% in value of the stock of which is and was held directly or indirectly by foreign persons at all times during a\nspecified testing period (provided that, if any class of a REIT\u2019s stock is regularly traded on an established securities\nmarket in the U.S., a person holding less than 5% of such class during the testing period is generally presumed not to\nbe a foreign person, unless the REIT has actual knowledge otherwise). Monmouth believes that it is a \u201cdomestically\ncontrolled qualified investment entity,\u201d and, therefore, assuming that Monmouth is a \u201cdomestically controlled\nqualified investment entity\u201d at the Effective Time, that taxation under FIRPTA will not apply to the receipt of cash in\nexchange for shares of Monmouth Common Stock pursuant to the Merger.\nIf Monmouth does not qualify as a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity,\u201d the tax consequences to a\nnon-U.S. holder of an exchange of shares of Monmouth Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will depend\nupon whether such stock is regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States and the amount\nof such stock that is held by the non-U.S. holder. Monmouth believes that Monmouth Common Stock is regularly\ntraded on an established securities market in the United States within the meaning of FIRPTA and the applicable\nTreasury regulations. Therefore, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax under\nFIRPTA. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences of the\nMerger to them, including the applicability of FIRPTA. In particular, a non-U.S. holder who has held more than 10% of\nMonmouth Common Stock at any time during the\n60\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\none-year period ending on the date of the Merger or a non-U.S. holder who is a \u201cqualified shareholder\u201d (within the\nmeaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) is urged to consult its tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of the\nreceipt of the Merger Consideration.\nHowever, even if not subject to FIRPTA, gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder as a result of the Merger will be\ntaxable to such holder if such gain is treated as effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. trade or\nbusiness and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty as a condition for subjecting the non-U.S. holder to U.S.\ntaxation on a net income basis, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that the non-U.S. holder\nmaintains in the U.S. In this case, the same treatment that applies to U.S. holders with respect to the gain will\ngenerally apply to the non-U.S. holder, and a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject to the 30%\nbranch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such gain. In\naddition, any such gain will be taxable to a non-U.S. holder if the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual\nwho was present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year or maintains an office or a fixed place of\nbusiness in the U.S. to which the gain is attributable. In such cases, a 30% tax (or such lower rate as may be specified\nby an applicable income tax treaty) will apply to the nonresident alien individual\u2019s capital gains, which may be offset\nby certain U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident\nof the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to\nsuch losses.\nNon-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules in light of\ntheir particular facts and circumstances and the procedures for claiming treaty benefits or otherwise establishing an\nexemption from U.S. withholding tax.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nHolders may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a\nrate of 24%) with respect to cash received pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding will generally not apply,\nhowever, to a holder who (1) in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and\ncertifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on a properly completed and duly executed IRS Form W-9, (2) in\nthe case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes a properly completed and duly executed, applicable IRS Form W-8, or (3) is\notherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with all applicable rules and certification requirements.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be\nclaimed as a refund or a credit against such holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) provided the required\ninformation is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis.\nThis discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and\nis not tax advice. Holders of Monmouth Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax\nconsequences to them of the Merger, including the effect of any federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax laws.\nDividends",

            "text": "Litigation Relating to the Merger\nBeginning on December 13, 2021, purported shareholders of Monmouth filed two lawsuits against Monmouth and\nmembers of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, challenging disclosures related to the Merger. The complaints (the\n\u201cComplaints\u201d), Wang v. Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, et al., No. 1:21-cv-10632 (S.D.N.Y.) and\nWhitfield v. Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, et al., No. 1:21-cv-10854 (S.D.N.Y.), allege, among other\nthings, that Monmouth and its directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated\nthereunder and that Monmouth\u2019s directors violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by causing the filing of a proxy\nstatement relating to the Merger with the SEC that misstates or omits certain allegedly material information.\nThe Complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief enjoining the consummation of the Merger, rescission of\nthe Merger to the extent implemented (or rescissory damages), accounting for damages, declaration that Monmouth\nand its directors violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder, and an award of\nthe plaintiff\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees. Monmouth believes that all of the claims asserted in the\nComplaints are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against such actions. However, litigation is inherently\nuncertain and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that the defense of the actions will be successful. If\nthe lawsuits are successful, they could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in costs to Monmouth.\nAdditional lawsuits relating to the Merger may also be filed in the future.\n62TABLE OF CONTENTS\nMARKET PRICE OF MONMOUTH COMMON STOCK",

A date has not been set for any\nsuch 2022 annual meeting. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated and Monmouth holds a 2022 annual\nmeeting, Monmouth will make a public announcement of the annual meeting date in connection with its proxy\nstatement for such meeting.\nIn the event Monmouth holds a 2022 annual meeting, shareholders interested in presenting a proposal for inclusion\nin the proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting may do so by following the procedures in Rule 14a-8 under the\nExchange Act.

Under Monmouth\u2019s current bylaws, nominations of individuals for election to\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors and the proposal of other business to be considered by Monmouth\u2019s shareholders at\nits 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, but not included in Monmouth\u2019s proxy statement, may be made by a person\nwho is a shareholder of record at the time of giving notice and at the time of such meeting, who delivers notice along\nwith the additional information and materials required by Monmouth\u2019s current bylaws to Monmouth\u2019s secretary at its\nprincipal executive offices not earlier than July 18, 2022 and not later than August 17, 2022. However, in the event that\nthe 2022 annual meeting of shareholders is advanced more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from the\nfirst anniversary of the date of the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must\nbe received no earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of the mailing of the notice for such annual meeting and not\nlater than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of the mailing of the notice for such\nannual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the mailing of the\nnotice of such meeting is first made.\n84TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS",
