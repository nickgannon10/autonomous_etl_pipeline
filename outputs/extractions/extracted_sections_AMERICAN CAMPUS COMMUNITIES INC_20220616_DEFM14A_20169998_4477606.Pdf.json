            "text": "The Special Meeting (page 29)\nThe Proposals\nThe virtual special meeting of our stockholders will be held on August 4, 2022 at 10:00 a.m., Central Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access\nthe virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit register.proxypush.com/acc. At the virtual special meeting, holders of our common stock, $0.01\npar value per share, which we refer to as \u201ccommon stock,\u201d as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022, will be asked to\nconsider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, which proposal we refer to as the\n\u201cmerger proposal,\u201d (2) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named\nexecutive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers, which proposal we refer to as the \u201cadvisory compensation proposal,\u201d and (3)\na proposal to approve any adjournment of the virtual special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes\nat the virtual special meeting to approve the merger proposal, which proposal we refer to as the \u201cadjournment proposal.\u201d If the merger is approved\nby our stockholders and completed as contemplated by the merger agreement, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately\nprior to the merger effective time will be converted into the right to receive $65.47 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nPursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting.\nRecord Date, Notice and Quorum\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of\nand attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock\nis entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the\nrecord date. On the record date, our outstanding voting securities consisted of 139,483,032 shares of common stock and 1,171,141 unvested\nrestricted stock awards entitled to be voted by employees.\nThe presence in person or by proxy of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the virtual special meeting will\nconstitute a quorum for purposes of the virtual special meeting. Virtual attendance at the virtual special meeting constitutes presence in person for\nquorum purposes at the virtual special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the virtual special meeting. Abstentions will be\ncounted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\nRequired Vote\nCompletion of the mergers requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast the\nmajority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each\nmatter to be voted on. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our stockholders are entitled to cast rather than\non the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail\nto instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting against the merger proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the approval of the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the mergers. For the purpose of each of these\nproposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other\nnominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will\nhave no effect on the outcome of these proposals.\n3Table of Contents\nAs of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 1,218,039 shares of our\ncommon stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 0.9% of the total combined voting power of our common stock at the virtual special meeting.\nOur directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of\nthe advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so.\nProxies\u037e Revocation\nAny of our stockholders of record entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its shares of common stock by returning the enclosed\nproxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or by attending the virtual special meeting and voting\nduring the live webcast. If the shares of common stock that you own are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, you should\ninstruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your broker or you may attend the\nvirtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast.\nAny proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by your delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy card, by authorizing your proxy\nby telephone or through the Internet at a later date than your previously authorized proxy, by your filing a written revocation of your proxy with our\nSecretary or by your voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting alone will not be sufficient to revoke a\npreviously authorized proxy.\nIf you own common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may revoke or change previously granted voting instructions by following the instructions\nprovided by the broker, bank or other nominee that is the registered owner of the shares or by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting.\nThe Mergers (page 33)",

As of March 31, 2022, we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility,\n$200 million in term loan financing outstanding, approximately $535.4 million in mortgage loans and project-based taxable bonds outstanding\n(including a $330 million mortgage loan made to wholly owned subsidiaries of a joint venture in which we own a 55% interest) and $2.8 billion in\nsenior unsecured notes outstanding.\nParent has informed us that it has received, in connection with the mergers, a debt commitment letter from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., providing for debt\nfinancing through two balance sheet loans in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $2.1 billion and that it currently intends to pursue\nadditional debt financing in connection with the mergers. In addition, it is expected that BREIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited\npartnership (the \u201cSponsor\u201d), which is the operating partnership of BREIT, and its affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding\nthe acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such debt financing.\nParent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing may\nbe used for purposes such as reserves, paying carrying costs with respect to the properties, funding working capital requirements, and for other\ncosts and expenses related to the financing and the mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under\nthe debt financing would be secured by, among other things, a mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned and/or ground leased by\nus, certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable\ncollateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings.\nThe merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a \u201cmarket MAC\u201d condition to the closing of the mergers.

The Charfauros Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including the\nrights, authorities and powers of the special committee, the confidentiality agreements with Blackstone and other counterparties, potential conflicts\nof interest involving certain directors and officers of the Company, the value of Company options, restricted stock units, and other equity awards\nthat the Company\u2019s directors and officers will receive in the proposed mergers, details regarding any discussions about the future employment of\nthe Company\u2019s officers and directors, certain financial projections and metrics, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of\nnon-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, and input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities\u2019 analysis. Relying on those allegations, the\nCharfauros Lawsuit asserts, on behalf of an individual plaintiff, a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and\na \u201ccontrol person\u201d claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a) violations against the members of our board of\ndirectors. The Charfauros Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers, rescission of the mergers if the mergers\nare consummated, the dissemination of a revised preliminary proxy statement, an award of damages if the mergers are consummated and an award of\nplaintiff\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe Stein Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company\u2019s directors. Like the Charfauros Lawsuit, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a\nclaim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of\nour board of directors. The Stein Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial\nprojections, financial metrics, input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities\u2019 analysis, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to\nGAAP metrics. The Stein Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers unless and until defendants disclose the\nmaterial information alleged to have been omitted from the proxy statement, rescission of the mergers or rescissory damages if the mergers are\nconsummated, an award of damages and an award of plaintiff\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe Acuna Lawsuit, like the Charfauros Lawsuit and the Stein Lawsuit, names as defendants the Company and the Company\u2019s directors and asserts\na claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of\nour board of directors. The Acuna Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial\nprojections (including line items underlying the projections, net income projections and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP\nmetrics), input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities\u2019 analysis, potential conflicts of interest involving KeyBank Capital Markets Inc. and\npotential conflicts of interest\n13Table of Contents\ninvolving certain directors and officers of the Company. The Acuna Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers,\nrescission of the mergers or rescissory damages if the mergers are consummated, a declaration that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of\nthe Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and an award of plaintiff\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the mergers from becoming effective in a timely manner.\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit and\nintends to defend against these actions vigorously.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 63)",

            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGERS\nThe following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the virtual special meeting and the proposed mergers.\nThese questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed\ninformation contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, as well as the additional documents to which it refers or which it incorporates by reference,\nincluding the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed transaction?\nA:\nThe proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Partnership, by affiliates of Blackstone pursuant to\nthe merger agreement. After the merger proposal has been approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger\nagreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub II will be merged with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership continuing as the\nSurviving Partnership. Immediately following the partnership merger effective time the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub I, with\nMerger Sub I continuing as the Surviving Company. The mergers will occur at the times provided in the merger agreement. For additional\ninformation about the mergers, please review the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated by reference into\nthis proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document governing the\nmergers.\nQ:\nAs a stockholder, what will I receive in the merger?\nA:\nFor each outstanding share of common stock that you own immediately prior to the merger effective time, you will receive $65.47 in cash, without\ninterest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nQ:\nWill I receive any regular quarterly dividends with respect to the common stock that I own?\nA:\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, we may not authorize, declare or pay any dividends to the holders of shares of our common stock without\nthe prior written consent of Parent, other than dividends determined in good faith to be required to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code or\nto avoid or reduce the payment of income or excise tax (with any such additional required dividend resulting in a corresponding decrease to the\ncommon stock consideration).\nQ:\nWhat will happen to my restricted stock?\nA:\nImmediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of restricted stock granted pursuant to an incentive award plan, other than\ndeferred stock awards, will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares\nof common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will have the right to receive\nthe common stock consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to my deferred stock awards?\nA:\nAll deferred stock awards will, as of immediately before the merger effective time, become vested and no longer subject to restriction, and all\ndeferred stock awards will, at the merger effective time, be adjusted and converted into a right of the holder to have allocated to the holder\u2019s\naccount under the deferred compensation plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of common stock\nallocated to such account as of the merger effective time and (2) the merger consideration, and will no longer represent a right to receive a number\nof shares of common stock.\n15Table of Contents\nQ:\nWhat will happen to the incentive award plans in the mergers?\nA:\nAt the merger effective time, the incentive award plans will terminate.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the mergers to be completed?\nA:\nIf our stockholders vote to approve the merger proposal, and assuming that the other conditions to the mergers are satisfied or waived, it is\nanticipated that the mergers will be completed in the third quarter of 2022. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the closing of the mergers will take\nplace on the third business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the mergers described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions\nto the Mergers\u201d (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the closing of the mergers, but subject to the\nsatisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing) or at such other date as mutually agreed by Parent and us. For further information\nregarding the timing of the closing of the mergers, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Effective Times\u037e Closing Date.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat happens if the mergers are not completed?\nA:\nIf the merger proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the mergers are not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not\nreceive any payment for their common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, American Campus Communities, Inc. will remain a public\ncompany, our common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and to be listed on the NYSE, and our common stock, restricted\nstock and partnership units will remain outstanding. Upon a termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, we will be required\nto pay Parent the company termination payment. In certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay us the parent termination payment\nupon termination of the merger agreement.\nQ:\nIf the mergers are completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my common stock?\nA:\nFollowing the completion of the merger, your shares of common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your portion of the\naggregate common stock consideration. Shortly after the mergers are completed, you will receive an instruction letter describing how you may\nexchange your shares of common stock for the common stock consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your\nbroker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to\neffect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the common stock consideration.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the virtual special meeting?\nA:\nThe virtual special meeting will be held on August 4, 2022 at 10:00 a.m., Central Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special\nmeeting, stockholders should visit register.proxypush.com/acc.\nQ:\nWho can vote and attend the virtual special meeting?\nA:\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of\nand attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock\nis entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the\nrecord date.\nQ:\nHow do I attend the virtual special meeting?\nA:\nThe virtual special meeting will be held in a virtual-only format on August 4, 2022 at 10:00 a.m., Central Time. You will not be able to physically\nattend the virtual special meeting. To access the virtual meeting,\n16\nTable of Contents\nstockholders should visit register.proxypush.com/acc. The virtual special meeting will start promptly at 10:00 a.m., Central Time. You will need the\nlatest versions of Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Edge or Firefox. Please ensure your browser is compatible. As a stockholder, you will then be\nrequired to enter your control number from your proxy card or broker\u2019s notice. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email.\nApproximately one hour prior to the start of the meeting an email will be sent to the email address you provided during registration with a unique\nlink to the virtual meeting. Please contact Investor Relations at (512) 732-1000 if you have any other questions in connection with attending the\nvirtual special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve the merger proposal?\nA:\nApproval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes\nentitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our\nstockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to\nyour broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve the advisory compensation proposal?\nA:\nApproval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of\nthis proposal, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will\nhave no effect on the proposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve the adjournment proposal?\nA:\nApproval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this\nproposal, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have\nno effect on the proposal.\nQ:\nWhy is my vote important?\nA:\nIf you do not authorize your proxy or voting instructions or vote at the virtual special meeting, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary\nquorum to hold the virtual special meeting. In addition, because the merger proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of our\ncommon stock entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting, your failure to authorize\nyour proxy or voting instructions or to vote at the virtual special meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the approval of the\nmerger proposal.\nQ:\nHow does the common stock consideration compare to the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock?\nA:\nThe merger consideration of $65.47 per share represents a premium of approximately 22% to the 90-calendar day volume-weighted average share\nprice ending April 18, 2022, a premium of approximately 30% over the closing stock price of February 16, 2022, the date immediately prior to our\ndisclosing receipt of an indication of willingness to offer to acquire us, and a premium of approximately 14% over closing price of our common stock\non April 18, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger agreement.\nQ:\nHow does our board of directors recommend that I vote?\nA:\nOur board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal, and \u201cFOR\u201d the\nadjournment proposal.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the advisory compensation proposal?\nA:\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the \u201cSEC,\u201d has adopted rules that require companies to seek a nonbinding,\nadvisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or\n17\nTable of Contents\nbecome payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the merger.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory compensation proposal?\nA:\nThe vote to approve the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Approval of\nthis proposal is not a condition to completion of the mergers. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our\nboard of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.\nAccordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the mergers are completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive\nthe compensation that may be paid or become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers.\nQ:\nDo any of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have any interest in the mergers that is different than mine?\nA:\nOur directors and executive officers have certain interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those interests of our\nstockholders generally. See \u201cThe Mergers \u2014 Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers\u201d for information about interests that\nour directors and executive officers have in the mergers that are different than yours.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the annexes attached to this proxy statement, please\nvote your shares or authorize a proxy to vote your shares in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. Holders of our common stock\nwill be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock owned as of the record date.\nQ:\nHow do I cast my vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote at the virtual special meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your shares at the\nvirtual special meeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying\npre-addressed, postage-paid envelope.\nQ:\nHow do I cast my vote if my common stock is held of record in \u201cstreet name\u201d?\nA:\nIf you own common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with\nthe instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, since brokers, banks and other nominees\ndo not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement. If you have not received such\nvoting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you\ndirections on how to vote your shares. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may also vote at the virtual special\nmeeting.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?\nA:\nWith respect to the merger proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe merger proposal. With respect to the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast\nyour vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give voting instructions to your broker,\nbank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals.\n18\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nHow will proxy holders vote my common stock?\nA:\nIf you properly authorize a proxy prior to the virtual special meeting, your shares will be voted as you direct. If you authorize a proxy but no\ndirection is otherwise made, your shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the\nadjournment proposal. Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual\nspecial meeting.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my common stock before the virtual special meeting?\nA:\nIf you held shares of common stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective time, you will retain your right to vote at the\nvirtual special meeting, but not the right to receive the common stock consideration for those shares. The right to receive such consideration when\nthe merger becomes effective will pass to the person who at that time owns the shares you previously owned.\nQ:\nCan I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?\nA:\nYes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it is\nexercised by filing with our Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending and voting at the virtual\nspecial meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you have\ninstructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the foregoing options for changing your vote do not apply and instead you must\nfollow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote or you may attend and vote at the virtual special\nmeeting.\nQ:\nIs the merger expected to be taxable to me?\nA:\nYes. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete\nliquidation of the Company and will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of shares of\ncommon stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the\namount of cash received with respect to such U.S. holder\u2019s shares of common stock in the merger, and (2) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its\nshares. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of the merger will depend on various factors, including whether the receipt\nof such payments is treated as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs pursuant to the provisions of\nFIRPTA. See \u201cThe Mergers\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\u2014Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of\nCommon Stock\u201d for further discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to non-U.S. holders. You should consult\nyour tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application\nand effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws). For further discussion, see \u201cThe Mergers\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat rights do I have if I oppose the merger?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the merger proposal. You are not, however, entitled to exercise any\nappraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder\u2019s shares in connection with\nthe merger. Because shares of our common stock were listed on the NYSE on the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the\nvirtual special meeting, pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law, our stockholders who object to the merger do not have any appraisal\nrights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger. For more information, see \u201cNo Dissenters\u2019 Rights\nof Appraisal.\u201d\n19\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the virtual special meeting?\nA:\nWe intend to announce preliminary voting results at the virtual special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be\nfiled with the SEC following the virtual special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC\u2019s website at\nwww.sec.gov when filed.\nQ:\nCan I participate if I am unable to attend the virtual special meeting?\nA:\nIf you are unable to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your\nproxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet.\nQ:\nHave any stockholders already agreed to approve the merger?\nA:\nNo. To our knowledge, none of our stockholders have entered into any agreement to vote any of their shares of common stock either in favor or\nagainst any proposal at the virtual special meeting.\nQ:\nWhere can I find more information about the Company?\nA:\nWe file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.pacapts.com. The\ninformation found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this proxy statement or\nany other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC.

Our board of directors is soliciting your proxy on our behalf. In\naddition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers and\nother employees.

Accordingly, if you own common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e.,\nin \u201cstreet name\u201d), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other\nnominee provides to you, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals\ndescribed in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares following the directions\ncontained in such voting instruction card. If\n30Table of Contents\nyou have not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other\nnominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may also vote at\nthe virtual special meeting. Because the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all\nof the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting\ninstructions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. Because the approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the\nadjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal, and because your bank, broker or other\nnominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting\ninstructions will have no effect on approval of either proposal, assuming a quorum is present.\nProxies and Revocation",

            "text": "Background of the Mergers\nOur board of directors regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans and reviews possible ways of increasing long-term\nstockholder value. As part of these evaluations, our board of directors periodically assesses our competitive position and actively monitors industry\ntrends, our short- and long-term operating performance, our stock price performance, our total stockholder return, our net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) and\npotential strategic and financial initiatives.\nOur long-term strategy has focused on the ownership and operation of differentiated, typically highly amenitized, student housing communities or\ndevelopment opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry that are projected to experience substantial increases in\nenrollment and/or are under-serviced in terms of existing on and/or off-campus student housing. Since implementing this strategy, we remained aware of\nour numerous challenges as the only remaining publicly-traded U.S. REIT focused on student housing properties, the difficulty in expanding our portfolio\nin the context of a competitive student housing industry particularly in light of the volatility of real estate values, interest rates and capitalization rates,\nand the discount to estimated NAV at which our common stock has recently traded. These factors, among others, have adversely impacted, and could\ncontinue to adversely impact, our ability to raise capital to fund future acquisitions and development activities at an optimal cost of capital or without\ncreating significant dilution for our stockholders.\nIn November 2020, Jonathan Litt, the Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Land & Buildings Capital Growth Fund, LP, a fund managed by Land &\nBuildings Investment Management, LLC (\u201cLand & Buildings\u201d), initiated discussion with our board and senior management regarding the Company\u2019s\nvaluation and strategic objectives, as well as other operational and governance matters. On December 8, 2020, Land & Buildings submitted a notice to the\nCompany regarding its intent to nominate three people for election to our board at the 2021 annual stockholder meeting. On December 8, 2020, the closing\nprice of our common stock was $43.01 per share.\nIn December 2020, the Company engaged BofA Securities to assist the Company and our board in connection with the actions of Land & Buildings and\nour ongoing efforts to add additional expertise to our board as well as our ongoing review of strategic and financial initiatives based on BofA Securities\u2019\nknowledge of and experience with the Company in light of having regularly advised us on a range of matters. Throughout December 2020 and January\n2021, our board\u2019s nominating and corporate governance committee conducted a search process for additional independent directors. During this time, the\nnominating and corporate governance committee considered 14 candidates and conducted interviews with nine of these candidates, including Land &\nBuildings\u2019 three prospective nominees.\nOn January 27, 2021, we entered into a cooperation agreement with Land & Buildings, pursuant to which the board appointed Messrs. Bulls and Leupold\nand Ms. Hill to the Board, who were three of the candidates\n33Table of Contents\nidentified by the Company. The board also established a capital allocation committee of four members: Mr. Leupold as its chair, Ms. Hill, Ms. Donnell and\nMr. Rippel. On January 27, 2021 the closing price of our common stock was $40.60 per share. The Company publicly disclosed the cooperation agreement\non a Form 8-K on January 28, 2021.\nThroughout 2021, our management and board and its committees focused their time and efforts on the re-stabilization of operations despite the\nchallenges presented by the global pandemic and, as we do in the normal course of our business, continued discussions with BofA Securities and\nDentons, the Company\u2019s outside legal counsel, regarding the evaluation of our stock price performance, total stockholder return, NAV and potential\nstrategic and financial initiatives.\nOn November 1, 2021, Mr. Litt sent a letter to Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold that, among other things, informed the Company that Land & Buildings\nintended to nominate Mr. Litt for election to the board at our 2022 annual shareholders meeting. Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold shared this letter with our\nother directors. Thereafter throughout November 2021, members of our board and management engaged in further correspondence and discussions with\nMr. Litt and Corey Lorinsky, an employee of Land & Buildings.\nOn November 3, 2021, our board of directors held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Dentons and BofA Securities in\nattendance. Our management reviewed and discussed with our board a preliminary draft of our projections for 2022 through 2027 and the assumptions\nused to prepare the projections, which information was prepared by management in the normal course of our business and historically provided to our\nboard at regularly-scheduled quarterly meetings. Representatives of BofA Securities discussed with our board of directors their preliminary financial\nanalysis of the Company, including current estimates of our NAV, as well as strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company, including\nremaining a standalone independent public company or selling or entering into joint ventures with respect to certain of our properties. The board also\ndiscussed the recent correspondence from Mr. Litt.\nOn November 15, 2021, our board of directors, with members of management, Dentons and BofA Securities in attendance, met to further discuss Land &\nBuildings\u2019 intention to nominate Mr. Litt to our board and was updated as to conversations between Mr. Litt and members of our capital allocation\ncommittee and management.\nDuring the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we conducted a competitive process among institutional investors for our capital recycling activity through\na joint venture for the ownership of our existing eight-property Arizona State University (ASU) on-campus student housing portfolio, seven of which\nwere developed by us in our public-private partnership program, or \u201cP3.\u201d This resulted in our entering into an agreement with Harrison Street\u2019s Social\nInfrastructure Platform on December 30, 2021 and provided evidence to us of potentially higher valuations on our P3 on-campus assets than had been\nseen in prior transactions with other student housing companies. This transaction was announced on January 13, 2022, on which date the closing price of\nour common stock was $56.01 per share.\nOn December 2, 2021, our board held a meeting, with representatives of management, Dentons and BofA Securities in attendance. The board further\ndiscussed Land & Buildings\u2019 intention to nominate Mr. Litt to our board and was updated as to conversations between Mr. Litt and members of our\ncapital allocation committee.\nDuring the week of December 6, 2021, William W. Talbot, our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, held a series of meetings in New York\nCity with various potential investors and industry participants to discuss general developments in the student housing industry, which senior\nmanagement historically has done in the normal course of our business. Also during these meetings, Mr. Talbot discussed our then current strategic\ninitiative to identify third party equity for growth opportunities. As a part of this process, on December 8, 2021, at the request of the Company, a\nrepresentative of Blackstone met with Mr. Talbot during which this strategic initiative and other potential joint venture opportunities between Blackstone\nand the Company were discussed. The Blackstone representative expressed Blackstone\u2019s interest in the student housing\n34\nTable of Contents\nsector, noting that Blackstone owned student housing properties, but informed Mr. Talbot that Blackstone was not interested at that time in engaging in a\njoint venture transaction. A potential acquisition of the Company was not discussed. Mr. Talbot reviewed these discussions with potential investors and\nindustry participants with Mr. Bayless, and thereafter Messrs. Bayless and Talbot updated the members of our board with respect thereto.\nOn December 13, 2021, Land & Buildings issued a press release announcing that it had sent an open letter to the Company\u2019s shareholders and would be\nhosting a conference call on December 16, 2021 to discuss the contents of its letter. On December 13, 2021 the closing price of our common stock was\n$55.04 per share. The letter advocated for asset sales by the Company and stated that Land & Buildings would be nominating a director for the board at\nthe 2022 annual meeting. On December 15, 2021, the board held a meeting, with members of management, Dentons and BofA Securities in attendance, to\ndiscuss the Land & Buildings letter and potential responses.\nOn December 17, 2021, Land & Buildings sent a letter to the Company nominating Mr. Lorinsky for election to our board at the 2022 annual meeting of\nshareholders and also publicly filed documentation with the SEC stating Land & Buildings\u2019 intent to solicit votes for Mr. Lorinsky at the 2022 annual\nmeeting.\nOn January 4, 2022, our board held a meeting, with representatives of senior management and Dentons in attendance. At this meeting, the directors\ndiscussed Land & Buildings\u2019 nomination of Mr. Lorinsky for election to the board, and was informed that the members of the nominating and corporate\ngovernance committee recommended against the nomination. Following a discussion of Mr. Lorinsky\u2019s candidacy, the board determined not to nominate\nhim to the board. On January 5, 2022, Ms. Donnell and Mr. Luck sent a letter to Mr. Litt informing Mr. Litt that after careful consideration the board did not\nintend to move forward with Mr. Lorinsky\u2019s candidacy and requested that Land & Buildings withdraw its director nomination and continue to engage\nprivately and constructively with the Company\u2019s board and management team.\nOn February 10, 2022, in light of the valuation of our P3 properties in the Harrison Street joint venture transaction, we initiated a discussion with a\nstrategic buyer in the student housing industry (\u201cParty A\u201d) to solicit an indicative analysis of value of our entire P3 property portfolio, which constitutes\na significant portion of our assets, for use in potential future sale or joint venture transactions involving some or all of the Company\u2019s P3 properties,\nincluding in furtherance of enhancing our strategic capital platform.\nOn February 15, 2022, the Company received an unsolicited letter from Land & Buildings in which Land & Buildings stated it was \u201cindicating its\nwillingness to offer to acquire\u201d the Company for $57.00 per share. On February 15, 2022, the closing price of our common stock was $50.35 per share.\nOn February 16, 2022, following discussions among members of the Board, management and the Company\u2019s advisors, we issued a press release (1)\ndisclosing that the Company had received a nomination of Mr. Lorinsky from Land & Buildings, (2) providing an update on the Company\u2019s extensive\nengagement with Land & Buildings, including the receipt of the February 15 letter and our board\u2019s view that Land & Buildings lacked the capital capacity\nand transaction experience to execute an acquisition of the Company, and (3) stating that our board is resolute in its commitment to acting in the best\ninterest of stockholders, and would always consider and respond to a bona fide, actionable proposal from a credible potential counterparty that maximizes\nvalue for stockholders.\nWe and Party A executed a confidentiality agreement on February 18, 2022 regarding the provision of information relating to our P3 property portfolio,\nwhich did not include a \u201cstandstill\u201d provision. Thereafter, we provided materials to Party A relating to property-level performance for the limited purpose\nof analyzing our P3 property portfolio.\nOn February 22, 2022, Mr. Talbot received an unsolicited telephone call from a representative of a financial buyer (\u201cParty B\u201d), to, in light of the public\ndisclosure of the overtures from Land & Buildings, request that if the\n35\nTable of Contents\nCompany were to engage in a sale process, Party B be included in such a process. The representative of Party B did not provide Mr. Talbot with an\nindication of value, its proposed sources of capital or a proposed transaction structure. Mr. Talbot informed Party B that he would inform Mr. Bayless and\nthe other members of the board of the discussion, which was subsequently done. There were no additional discussions between the Company and Party\nB, or their respective representatives, until BofA Securities contacted Party B on March 15, 2022 at the direction of our board, as discussed below.\nOn February 28, 2022, a representative of Blackstone called a representative of BofA Securities to express Blackstone\u2019s high degree of interest in the\npotential acquisition of the Company, noting that Blackstone had performed initial due diligence based on publicly available information. The\nrepresentative of BofA Securities stated that he would convey Blackstone\u2019s interest to the Company, but that he did not believe the Company would\nconsider any proposal unless the price exceeded the $57.00 per share price proposed by Land & Buildings. Blackstone\u2019s representative stated that\nBlackstone could quickly complete its due diligence review and indicated that Blackstone would not require any financing contingency if the Company\nwere to pursue a transaction with Blackstone.\nBy letter dated March 1, 2022 from Ms. Donnell to Land & Buildings, Ms. Donnell requested information regarding Land & Buildings\u2019 sources and uses\nof funding and informed Land & Buildings that the board did not believe the proposed price appropriately valued the Company. On March 1, 2022, the\nclosing price of our common stock was $53.24 per share.\nAlso on March 1, 2022, Party A submitted a preliminary non-binding indicative value analysis of our P3 property portfolio based on applying a fixed\ndiscount rate to all of our P3 properties, with a caveat that any upward movement in interest rates would significantly impact the analysis.\nOn March 2, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Dentons and BofA Securities in\nattendance. Representatives of BofA Securities discussed with our board of directors the current interest rate, capital market and M&A environments as\nwell as the February 28, 2022 discussion with Blackstone. The board also discussed the recent correspondence with Mr. Litt and the indicative value\nanalysis of our P3 property portfolio from Party A.\nOn March 14, 2022, our board held a meeting with members of senior management and representatives of Dentons and BofA Securities in attendance. At\nthe meeting, BofA Securities provided our board with an overview of general market trends in the student housing real estate industry and the broader\nREIT market, including the fact that our shares generally traded in the public markets at a discount to our NAV, certain publicly available information\nregarding implied premiums paid in selected precedent transactions in the REIT industry, and strategic alternatives that may be available to us, including\na sale of the Company, remaining a standalone public company or selling or entering into joint ventures with respect to some of our properties.\nManagement reviewed with our board an updated version of managements\u2019 projections for 2022 through 2027, reflecting the 2022 budget and 2021 actual\ndata (the \u201cupdated management financial projections\u201d), which are discussed in more detail under \u201c\u2014Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d\nRepresentatives of BofA Securities then discussed with our board of directors their preliminary financial analysis of the Company and, among other\nitems, current capital and other market and geopolitical conditions and their potential impact on the Company and a sale transaction. A discussion ensued\namong the directors, management, Dentons, and BofA Securities regarding, among other things, risks and considerations related to opportunities to grow\nour business, challenges we face and that could arise in the future, the cost of obtaining capital and the amount of capital needed to acquire all of our\ncommon stock for cash. The board also considered factors that indicated it was an opportune time to engage in a sale of the Company, including, among\nothers, favorable valuations in recent precedent transactions in the REIT industry, the indicative value analysis of our P3 property portfolio prepared by\nParty A and the risks inherent in delaying any sale in light of recent increases in interest rates and the likelihood that capitalization and interest rates\nwould continue to rise, which would make it more expensive for a potential buyer to finance a transaction at a later time, changes in geopolitical\nconditions and the other challenges\n36\nTable of Contents\ncurrently facing the Company. Members of our senior management also reviewed and discussed with our board of directors potential risks to the\nCompany from leaks that may result from reaching out to potential bidders to acquire the Company, which could result in damage to our relationships\nwith our university partners, and determined that any sale transaction should be conducted in an expeditious manner in order to mitigate such risks. A\nrepresentative of Dentons reviewed the directors\u2019 duties under Maryland law in connection with a potential acquisition of the Company and\nrepresentatives of Dentons and BofA Securities discussed with the board various potential processes for a sale transaction, such as a reduced\ntermination fee for a period of time after entering into a merger agreement to facilitate competing proposals from other bidders while having a binding\nagreement to sell the Company. After discussion, the board authorized BofA Securities to initiate discussions with Party B and Blackstone, which were\nviewed as parties whose size and investment experience demonstrated they could be credible bidders for the Company, to determine if either was\ninterested in providing its views on the valuation of the Company. The board also authorized the Company to enter into confidentiality agreements with\nBlackstone and Party B and to provide them with diligence materials, and instructed BofA Securities to inform Ms. Donnell, as the chair of our board, and\nMr. Leupold, as the chair of the capital allocation committee of our board, of any responses from Party B and Blackstone. Our board also directed\nmembers of management to refrain from having discussions with Blackstone and Party B regarding the roles or compensation, if any, of management\nfollowing the closing of any transaction. Management agreed not to engage in such discussions.\nOn March 14, 2022, as directed by our board, representatives of BofA Securities called a representative of Blackstone and a representative of Party B to\nexplore each\u2019s interest in providing its views regarding the valuation of the Company, and subsequently sent to each a draft confidentiality agreement.\nBofA Securities notified our management, Ms. Donnell, Mr. Leupold and Dentons of these conversations.\nOn March 17, 2022, Blackstone entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company, which contained a customary \u201cstandstill\u201d provision that\nprevented Blackstone from, among other things, making a proposal with respect to an acquisition of the Company except on a confidential basis to the\nCompany. On March 18, 2022, a representative of BofA Securities emailed a representative of Blackstone requesting that, if Blackstone was interested in\nproviding a view on valuation, to respond by March 25, 2022 and include Blackstone\u2019s key valuation assumptions and thinking around the financing\nrelated to the potential transaction. The representative of BofA Securities also offered to arrange due diligence calls with management. Commencing on\nMarch 18, 2022, the Company provided due diligence materials to Blackstone, and members of management, with the participation of representatives of\nBofA Securities, had multiple discussions with representatives of Blackstone regarding Blackstone\u2019s due diligence review of the Company and its\nbusiness.\nDuring a telephone conversation initiated by a representative of Party B on March 22, 2022, Party B informed BofA Securities that Party B declined to\nexecute a confidentiality agreement or to further engage regarding the potential acquisition of the Company because, among other matters, due to recent\nvolatility and deterioration in the debt and financial markets, Party B did not think it would be able to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms in\norder to be able to enter into an agreement for an acquisition of the Company at this time.\nOn March 24, 2022, our board of directors was provided a letter from BofA Securities with respect to certain relationships with Blackstone, which we refer\nto as the \u201cBofA Securities Disclosure Letter.\u201d\nOn March 25, 2022, Blackstone provided a letter to our board, proposing to acquire all of our outstanding common stock for $63.00 per share in cash\n(representing an approximate 16% premium to the $54.41 per share closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on March 24, 2022). The letter stated\nthat Blackstone would proceed without any financing contingency and was prepared to complete its remaining confirmatory due diligence and\nconcurrently negotiate a definitive merger agreement within two weeks. Blackstone separately confirmed to BofA Securities that Blackstone was prepared\nto move expeditiously and use the fully negotiated agreement from Blackstone\u2019s recently announced acquisition of Preferred Apartment Communities,\nInc. as a precedent agreement for the proposed transaction with the Company.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOn March 25, 2022, Land & Buildings filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC in connection with its nomination of Mr. Lorinsky to the board at\nthe 2022 annual stockholder meeting.\nOn March 27 and 29, 2022, our board held meetings with members of our senior management team and representatives from BofA Securities and Dentons\nin attendance. During the meeting, representatives of BofA Securities reviewed with our board the discussions with Blackstone and Party B since the last\nmeeting of our board on March 14, including the terms of Blackstone\u2019s proposal and the fact that Party B declined to further engage regarding a potential\nacquisition of the Company, and that no other parties had expressed interest in acquiring the Company following the Company\u2019s press release of\nFebruary 16, 2022 relating to the Land & Buildings proposal, and that there had been no engagement with Land & Buildings since that date.\nRepresentatives of BofA Securities then discussed with our board of directors an update to their preliminary financial analysis of the Company and,\namong other items, current capital and other market and geopolitical conditions and their potential impact on the Company and a sale transaction. A\ndiscussion ensued among the directors, management and our outside counsel and financial advisor regarding, among other things, risks and\nconsiderations related to opportunities to grow our business, challenges we face and that could arise in the future, the cost of obtaining capital, reasons\nwhy Blackstone might be able to realize more value from the business than another bidder and thereby pay a higher price to acquire the Company,\nincluding Blackstone\u2019s low cost of capital, substantial available capital and interest in student housing properties and platform, and the amount of capital\nneeded to acquire all of our common stock for cash. Our board of directors discussed with management and our advisors the best process for maximizing\nstockholder value if the Company were to be sold, including whether a competitive bidding process would yield a higher price than Blackstone\u2019s proposal\nand the use of a two-tiered termination fee structure to facilitate competing bids after signing a merger agreement, as well as benefits and risks to the\nCompany and its business posed by contacting other potential bidders, including the risk that engaging with or contacting other potential bidders prior\nto signing a definitive agreement with Blackstone could jeopardize the availability of Blackstone\u2019s proposal. Our board also discussed with management\nand our advisors other potential risks and considerations that included the lack of public strategic buyers as the Company is the only public student\nhousing company, the limited universe of potential third parties with the financial ability to acquire the Company in light of the size of the Company, the\nrecent increase in interest rates and the expectation that interest rates would continue to rise, which would make it more expensive for a potential buyer to\nfinance a transaction, concerns about the possibility of a leak that the Company was exploring a possible sale disrupting our university relationships\nincluding our ability to pursue P3 transactions during a period of uncertainty and risking employee turnover. Following further discussion, our board of\ndirectors determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue to engage in discussions with Blackstone and\ndirected Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold to present Blackstone with a counterproposal for a purchase price of $66.00 per share of common stock in cash.\nDuring the March 27, 2022 board meeting, representatives of BofA Securities described its qualifications and experience with these types of transactions.\nFollowing the departure of the BofA Securities representatives from the meeting, our board discussed with management and a representative of Dentons\nthe contemplated engagement of BofA Securities as our financial advisor with respect to a potential sale of the Company, BofA Securities\u2019 relationships\nwith Blackstone and the fees to be paid to BofA Securities in connection with their engagement. After considering the overall reputation, experience and\nqualifications of BofA Securities, as well as BofA Securities\u2019 knowledge of the student housing and broader real estate market and our business and\nproperties in particular, and information provided by BofA Securities in the BofA Securities Disclosure Letter as discussed under \u201c\u2014Opinion of Our\nFinancial Advisor,\u201d our board unanimously approved the engagement of BofA Securities as our financial advisor with respect to a potential sale of the\nCompany and authorized management and Dentons to finalize the engagement letter with BofA Securities.\nAlso during these meetings, the directors and a representative of Dentons discussed the best way to proceed with future negotiations with Blackstone\ngiven the directors\u2019 view that expediting the transaction process would be critical to minimizing risks to the Company. Our board determined to form a\nspecial committee of directors consisting of independent directors (Mss. Donnell and Hill and Messrs. Leupold and Rippel) in order to\n38\nTable of Contents\nexpeditiously evaluate and handle future negotiations with Blackstone. Our board also discussed the interests of our executive officers in the mergers\nthat are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally, as discussed under \u201c\u2014Interests of our Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Mergers.\u201d\nOn March 30, 2022, Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold, joined by Mr. Bayless and a representative of BofA Securities, communicated the Company\u2019s\ncounteroffer of $66.00 per share of common stock in cash to representatives of Blackstone. A representative of Blackstone stated that, if it were provided\nwith additional due diligence information, Blackstone may be able to increase its $63.00 per share price, and the representative of BofA Securities\nindicated that the Company was prepared to provide access to additional due diligence information so that Blackstone could seek to improve its price.\nOn March 31, 2022, representatives of the Company and Blackstone met in person at our corporate office in Austin, Texas as part of Blackstone\u2019s\nongoing due diligence review.\nOn April 5, 2022, a representative of Blackstone verbally communicated to representatives of BofA Securities that Blackstone was prepared to increase its\npurchase price from $63.00 to $65.00 per share (representing an approximate 15% premium to the $56.74 per share closing price of the Company\u2019s common\nstock on April 4, 2022), which was confirmed in a letter received that day from Blackstone addressed to our board.\nAlso on April 5, 2022, our board held a meeting with members of our senior management team and representatives from BofA Securities and Dentons in\nattendance. During the meeting, the Company\u2019s board received an update regarding the discussions with Blackstone since the meeting of our board on\nMarch 27, including the increase in price in Blackstone\u2019s revised proposal. BofA Securities reviewed recent geopolitical risks and interest rate and market\nvolatility, as well as an update to the financial analysis of the common stock consideration. The group reviewed discussions held at earlier meetings\nregarding the performance of the Company\u2019s business and its prospects as an independent company and concluded that there was a risk that Blackstone\ncould withdraw or adversely modify its proposal, particularly in light of the limited number of third parties with the financial ability to acquire the\nCompany for cash without a financing contingency given the size of the Company, and that the Company should continue to negotiate the Blackstone\nproposal on an expedited basis to protect the Company\u2019s business and maximize stockholder value. The board authorized BofA Securities to let\nBlackstone know that the Company was prepared to continue discussions regarding a potential acquisition of the Company.\nIn light of Blackstone\u2019s increased price, following the board meeting on April 5, 2022, a representative of BofA Securities called representatives of\nBlackstone and indicated that the Company was prepared to continue discussions with Blackstone regarding a potential acquisition of the Company.\nBeginning on April 6, 2022, we opened a virtual data room to provide Blackstone with access to additional due diligence information and thereafter\nBlackstone continued its due diligence review and conducted site visits at a number of our properties, including our Disney project. As part of this due\ndiligence review, which continued until the execution of the definitive merger agreement, the parties and their representatives engaged in various\ndiscussions regarding the Company and its business, operations, activities and financial information.\nOn April 8, 2022, Blackstone\u2019s outside counsel, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (\u201cSimpson Thacher\u201d), sent to Dentons drafts of a merger agreement,\nlimited guaranty and equity commitment letter. The draft merger agreement contemplated that, among other things, (i) the Company would merge with and\ninto a wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Blackstone and another wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Blackstone would merge with and into\nthe Partnership, with the respective holders of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and units in the Partnership to receive the same cash\nconsideration per share or unit, (ii) the Company would be subject to customary prohibitions on soliciting alternative proposals with a two-tier\ntermination fee (equal to 2.0% of the Company\u2019s equity value if the Company terminated the merger agreement within 40 days after signing the merger\nagreement with Blackstone to accept a superior proposal received during the first 30 days\n39\nTable of Contents\nafter signing the merger agreement with Blackstone, and otherwise 3.5% of the Company\u2019s equity value ), along with matching rights if any superior\nproposal were received and a reverse termination fee of 9% of the Company\u2019s equity value payable by Blackstone in certain circumstances as an\nexclusive remedy with no specific performance, (iii) the Company would not be permitted to pay any dividends other than those necessary to maintain\nREIT status with the per share purchase price being decreased by an amount equal to any such dividends, and (iv) subject to certain exceptions, the\nCompany would be permitted flexibility to continue to operate in the ordinary course of business prior to closing.\nOn April 10, 2022, a representative of BofA Securities called representatives of Blackstone regarding the initial draft of the merger agreement provided by\nSimpson Thacher. As compared to Blackstone\u2019s initial draft, the Company proposed that (i) the lower termination fee be reduced from 2.0% to 1.5% of the\nCompany\u2019s equity value if the Company terminated the merger agreement within 40 days after signing the merger agreement with Blackstone to accept a\nsuperior proposal received during the first 30 days after signing the merger agreement with Blackstone and otherwise from 3.5% to 3.0% of the\nCompany\u2019s equity value and (ii) that the Company be permitted to continue paying its regular quarterly dividends prior to the closing of a transaction.\nOn April 11, 2022, Dentons sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Simpson Thacher which, among other things, contemplated the changes\nregarding termination fees and ability to pay dividends proposed by representatives of BofA Securities to representatives of Blackstone on the previous\nday.\nBetween April 11, 2022 and April 13, 2022, the special committee, with the assistance of Dentons and BofA Securities, and Blackstone, with the assistance\nof Simpson Thacher, continued to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement. The negotiations covered various aspects of the transaction, including,\namong other things, the representations and warranties made by the parties, the restriction on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business until completion of\nthe transaction, the conditions to completion of the mergers, the termination provisions and the amounts of termination fee payable by us, our ability to\npay quarterly dividends between signing and closing, and provisions regarding our equity awards, employee benefit plans, retention, severance and\nother compensation matters. Blackstone confirmed that it would agree to accept the Company\u2019s proposed two-tier termination fee of 1.5% and 3.0% of the\nCompany\u2019s equity value, but that the Company should not be permitted to pay any quarterly dividends between signing and closing. Blackstone\ncontinued its confirmatory due diligence until the execution of the merger agreement on April 18, 2022 and the parties continued to exchange drafts of the\nmerger agreement and related documentation until then.\nOn April 11, 2022, our board received a letter from Mr. Litt notifying it that Land & Buildings was withdrawing its director nominee, which the Company\npublicly disclosed on a Form 8-K on April 13, 2022.\nOn April 12, 2022, Mss. Donnell and Hill, as members of the special committee and the chair of the board and compensation committee, respectively, and\nMr. Bayless discussed and negotiated with Blackstone the terms of certain compensation and severance matters relating to the Company\u2019s senior\nmanagement and other employees relating to retention and continuity of operations, which are described elsewhere in this proxy statement.\nOn April 14, 2022, representatives of the special committee, Company management, Dentons and BofA Securities, and Blackstone and Simpson Thacher,\ndiscussed the terms of the merger agreement, including the Company\u2019s position that it should be permitted to continue to pay regular quarterly\ndividends.\nOn April 16, 2022, our board met with members of our management team and representatives from BofA Securities and Dentons in attendance during\nwhich the special committee and our legal and financial advisors provided an update on the negotiations with Blackstone, including with respect to\nBlackstone\u2019s proposed restriction on the Company paying dividends during the pendency of the merger agreement. The board discussed the terms of\nBlackstone\u2019s latest proposal and agreed to respond by proposing either the right to pay the regular dividend of $0.47 per share for the first quarter after\nsigning the merger agreement or a corresponding increase to the purchase price. Representatives of BofA Securities discussed Blackstone\u2019s liquidity to\nsupport its equity commitment. Representatives of BofA Securities also presented to our board BofA Securities\u2019 updated financial\n40\nTable of Contents\nanalysis of the common stock consideration. A representative of Dentons noted that BofA Securities had provided an update to BofA Securities\nDisclosure Letter identifying relationships between BofA Securities and Blackstone, a copy of which had been provided to the directors prior to this\nmeeting, and summarized the merger agreement and other transaction documentation, copies of which had also been provided to the directors prior to\nthis meeting, noting that they were substantially complete and it would be possible, if the board were to approve the transaction, to sign the merger\nagreement before the market opened on April 19, 2022, subject to resolution of the dividend payment issue.\nFollowing the meeting, at the direction of the board, Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold verbally communicated our counterproposal to a representative of\nBlackstone regarding the quarterly dividend. On April 18, 2022, a representative of Blackstone informed Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold that Blackstone\nwas prepared to increase the purchase price from $65.00 a share to $65.47 per share (representing a premium of approximately 22% to the 90-calendar day\nvolume-weighted average share price ending April 18, 2022, a premium of approximately 30% over the closing stock price of February 16, 2022, the date\nimmediately prior to the Company disclosing receipt of an indication of willingness to offer to acquire the Company, and a premium of approximately 14%\nover the closing stock price on April 18, 2022 of $57.58 per share) but that the Company would not be permitted to pay any regular quarterly dividends\nfollowing the execution of the merger agreement.\nOn April 18, 2022, the special committee held a meeting with representatives of BofA Securities and Dentons in attendance. Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold\ninformed the other members of the special committee of the response from Blackstone to increase the purchase price to $65.47 and prohibit subsequent\ndividends. After discussion, the special committee unanimously recommended that our board of directors approve the merger agreement with Blackstone.\nLater in the day on April 18, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting with members of our management team and representatives from BofA Securities\nand Dentons in attendance. Ms. Donnell updated the board on the discussions with Blackstone and informed the board that the special committee had\nmet earlier that day and unanimously recommended the approval of the merger agreement with Blackstone. A representative of Dentons reviewed with\nour board the duties of directors under applicable law and the application of those duties to the evaluation of a potential sale of the Company and the\nproposed terms of the merger agreement and other transaction documents and discussed the changes that had been made to the documents since the\nboard of directors\u2019 meeting held on April 16, 2022, which changes were reflected in marked copies of the documents provided to our board of directors in\nadvance of the meeting. A representative of Dentons also reviewed certain employee-related matters that were addressed in the merger agreement,\nincluding the effect that the mergers would have on the Company\u2019s existing employee benefits plans and outstanding equity awards and certain amounts\nthat may be paid or become payable to the Company\u2019s named executive officers as a result of the mergers and that the interests of our executive officers\nin the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally, as discussed under \u201c\u2014Interests of our Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Mergers.\u201d A representative of Dentons then reviewed with the board a proposed amendment to the Company\u2019s bylaws that\nwould make specified state and federal courts in Maryland the sole and exclusive forum for litigation relating to the Company\u2019s internal affairs, including\nstockholder derivative suits and alleged breaches of duties owed to stockholders, and the federal district courts in the United States the sole and\nexclusive forum for litigation arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. BofA Securities then reviewed with our board BofA Securities\u2019\nfinancial analysis of the merger consideration to be paid to stockholders and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated\nApril 18, 2022, to our board of directors to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered and limitations and qualifications described in the opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (other than Parent and its affiliates). A representative of Dentons then reviewed the\nproposed resolutions prepared for the proposed transaction, including the engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. as an additional financial\nproposed resolutions prepared for the proposed transaction, including the engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. as an additional financial\nadvisor to the Company. Following these presentations and discussions, and other discussions by our board of directors concerning, among other\nthings, the matters described below under \u201c\u2014Reasons for the Mergers,\u201d\n41\nTable of Contents\nincluding our board of directors\u2019 belief that the mergers are more favorable to our stockholders than other strategic transactions available to the\nCompany, including remaining as an independent public company, our board of directors unanimously determined the mergers to be advisable, approved\nthe mergers on the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement and resolved to recommend the approval of the mergers by our stockholders.\nFollowing the board of directors\u2019 meeting, BofA Securities contacted representatives of Blackstone to advise them that our board of directors had\nunanimously approved the proposed transaction.\nDuring the evening of April 18, 2022, the Company, affiliates of Blackstone and the other parties thereto executed and delivered the merger agreement.\nThe Company issued a press release publicly announcing the mergers and execution of the merger agreement before the opening of the market on April\n19, 2022.\nReasons for the Mergers",

shares of our common stock, and the fact that the merger consideration of $65.47 per share in\ncash represents a premium of approximately 22% to the 90-calendar day volume-weighted average share price

company buyer existed, a private buyer might be able to realize more value from the business than a public\ncompany buyer and thereby pay a higher price to acquire the Company, including the ability of private companies to use higher leverage to\npursue growth that is more accretive, to absorb near-term dilution from capital expenditures in favor of longer-term growth and to fund\ndevelopments

Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the terms and conditions of the merger agreement were reviewed by the independent special committee and the board of directors with\nour financial and legal advisors, and the fact that such terms were the product of arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the parties\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger would be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and

fail, to satisfy its obligations under the merger agreement,\nwe are not entitled to specifically enforce the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter, and that our exclusive remedy, available if\nthe merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, would be limited to the parent termination payment in the amount of $832\nmillion (the payment of which is guaranteed by BREIT

Such financial projections were provided to our board of directors and to BofA Securities for use in connection\nwith its financial analyses and fairness opinion.\n45Table of Contents\nThese financial projections were not intended for public disclosure, and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC,\nthe guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts or generally\naccepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have\naudited, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the projections nor expressed an opinion or any form of assurance on the financial\nprojections or their achievability, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, such financial projections. A summary of the\nfinancial projections is included in this proxy statement only because the financial projections were made available to our board of directors and BofA\nSecurities as described in this proxy statement. The inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or\nrepresentation by us that the information contained therein is material information.\nIn the view of our management, the financial projections were prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting management\u2019s best available estimates and\njudgments regarding our future financial performance at the time they were prepared. The financial projections have been included only to reflect\ninformation made available to our board of directors and BofA Securities at the time of certain events and decisions, are not facts and should not be relied\nupon as indicative of actual future results, and you are cautioned not to rely on the financial projections. Some or all of the assumptions that have been\nmade in connection with the preparation of the financial projections may have changed since the date the financial projections were prepared. None of\nthe Company or any of our affiliates, advisors or other representatives assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or\ncompleteness of the financial projections. Neither the Company nor any of our affiliates have or intend to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to,\nupdate, revise or correct the financial projections if any or all of them have become or become inaccurate (even in the short term) since the time of their\npreparation. These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the financial projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.\nThe financial projections do not reflect changes in general business or economic conditions since the time they were prepared, changes in our\nbusinesses or prospects since the time they were prepared, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not\nanticipated at the time the financial projections were prepared, and the financial projections are not necessarily indicative of current values or future\nperformance, which may be significantly more favorable or less favorable than as set forth below and should not be regarded as a representation that the\nfinancial projections will be achieved. The projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. In addition,\nour future financial performance may be affected by our ability to successfully implement a number of initiatives to improve our operations and financial\nperformance and our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods.\nBecause the financial projections reflect subjective judgment in many respects, they are susceptible to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions\nbased on actual experience and business developments. The financial projections also cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes\nless predictive with each succeeding year. The estimates and assumptions underlying the financial projections involve judgments with respect to, among\nother things, economic, competitive and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject\nto significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the\nbusiness and economic conditions affecting the industries in which we operate. The financial projections constitute forward-looking information and are\nsubject to a wide variety of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results. For\nadditional information on factors that may cause our future financial results to materially vary from the projected results summarized below, see\n\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 22 of this proxy statement. Accordingly, there can be no assurance\nthat the projected results summarized below will be realized or that actual results will not differ materially from the projected results summarized below, and\nthe financial projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied upon as such. Neither we\n46\nTable of Contents\nnor our affiliates nor advisors nor any other person has made any representation to any of our stockholders or any other person regarding our actual\nperformance compared to the results included in the financial projections. We have not made any representation to Blackstone or its affiliates, in the\nmerger agreement or otherwise, concerning the financial projections.\nThe financial projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained in our\npublic filings with the SEC. The financial projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared,\nincluding the mergers. Further, the financial projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the mergers to be consummated and should\nnot be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nFinancial Projections\nThe following table summarizes the financial projections of the Company that were provided to our board of directors in connection with the evaluation\nof a possible transaction. The following financial projections were also provided to BofA Securities by us for use in connection with its financial analyses\nand the fairness opinion rendered to our board of directors (summarized under \u201c\u2014Opinion of Our Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 48 of this proxy\nstatement).\nOur management made various assumptions when preparing the financial projections. These assumptions included compound annual revenue growth of\napproximately 9% from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2027, compound annual consolidated net operating income growth of approximately 10%\nfrom fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2027, compound annual net operating income (at share) growth of approximately 10% from fiscal year end 2022\nto fiscal year end 2027, compound annual EBITDA (at share) growth of approximately 10% from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2027, compound\nannual funds from operations-modified (\u201cFFOM\u201d) growth of approximately 10% from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2027 and compound annual\nFFOM per share growth of approximately 7% from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2027.\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\nOwned Properties Revenues\n$\n992\n$ 1,080\n$ 1,147\n$ 1,243\n$ 1,381\n$ 1,519\nOwned Properties NOI(1)(6)\n$\n552\n$\n606\n$\n644\n$\n697\n$\n772\n$\n880\nOwned Properties NOI (at share)(2)(6)\n$\n528\n$\n570\n$\n607\n$\n660\n$\n734\n$\n841\nEBITDA (at share)(3)(6)\n$\n474\n$\n504\n$\n536\n$\n585\n$\n654\n$\n757\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(4)(6)\n$\n344\n$\n(16)\n$ (341)\n$ (434)\n$ (158)\n$\n202\nFFOM(5)(6)\n$\n351\n$\n384\n$\n416\n$\n457\n$\n511\n$\n569\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding\u2014diluted\n141.1\n142.4\n146.6\n152.9\n159.2\n165.2\nFFOM per diluted share(5)(6)\n$ 2.49\n$ 2.70\n$ 2.84\n$ 2.99\n$\n3.21\n$\n3.44\n(1)\nNet operating income (\u201cNOI\u201d) is calculated as property revenues less direct operating expenses, excluding depreciation, but including an allocation\nof costs related to corporate management and oversight.\n(2)\nNOI (at share) is NOI adjusted for our ownership interest in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.\n(3)\nEBITDA (at share) is calculated as Owned Properties NOI (at share) plus third-party development and management services revenue, on-campus\nparticipating property (\u201cOCPP\u201d) management fees and interest on a loan we made to the owner of one OCPP, our share of OCPP net cash flow, and\ninterest income minus third-party development and management services expense, ground/facility leases expense, general and administrative\nexpense, and OCPP overhead.\n(4)\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow is calculated as EBITDA (at share) plus proceeds from the sale of properties or interests in properties less capital\nexpenditures, such as acquisitions, renovations, development, investments in joint venture properties and property upgrades and maintenance.\n47\nTable of Contents\n(5)\nFFOM is calculated as funds from operations (FFO) modified to reflect certain adjustments related to the economic performance of our OCPPs and\nexcludes other items, as we determined in good faith, that do not reflect our core operations on a comparative basis.

Our calculation of FFO and FFOM may differ from methodologies utilized by other equity REITs\nfor similar performance measurements and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other REITs.\n(6)\nNOI, EBITDA, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and FFOM are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as an alternative to net\nincome or loss computed in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed\nin accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our liquidity, nor are these measures indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our\nability to pay dividends or make distributions.\nOpinion of Our Financial Advisor\nThe Company has retained BofA Securities to act as the Company\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the mergers. BofA Securities is an internationally\nrecognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,\nnegotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.\nThe Company selected BofA Securities to act as the Company\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the mergers on the basis of the Company\u2019s prior\nretention of BofA Securities in various investment banking matters, BofA Securities\u2019 experience in transactions similar to the mergers, its reputation in the\ninvestment community and its familiarity with the Company and its business.\nOn April 18, 2022, BofA Securities delivered to our board of directors an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion, dated April 18, 2022,\nto the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the common\nstock consideration to be received by holders of our common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of BofA Securities\u2019 written opinion, dated April 18, 2022, to our board of directors, which sets forth, among other things, the various\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by BofA Securities in\nrendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of\nBofA Securities\u2019 opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA Securities delivered its opinion to our board of\ndirectors for the benefit and use of our board of directors (in its capacity as our board of directors) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation\nof the common stock consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Securities\u2019 opinion does not address any terms or other aspects or implications\nof the mergers and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the mergers in comparison to other strategies or transactions that\nmight be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage or as to the underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with or\neffect the mergers. BofA Securities\u2019 opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the\nproposed mergers or any other matter.\nIn connection with its opinion, BofA Securities, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company\u037e\n48\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of the Company\nfurnished to or discussed with BofA Securities by the management of the Company, including certain financial forecasts relating to the\nCompany prepared by the management of the Company, which are described under \u201c\u2014Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d and\nreferred to in the proxy statement as the \u201cupdated management financial projections\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\ndiscussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company with members of senior\nmanagement of the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the trading history for our common stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading histories of other companies\nBofA Securities deemed relevant\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared certain financial and stock market information of the Company with similar information of other companies BofA Securities\ndeemed relevant\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared certain financial terms of the mergers to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions BofA Securities\ndeemed relevant\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft, dated April 18, 2022, of the merger agreement (which we refer to in this section of this proxy statement as the \u201cDraft\nAgreement\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Securities deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and\nother information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with BofA Securities and BofA Securities relied upon\nthe assurances of the management of the Company that it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data\ninaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the updated management financial projections, BofA Securities was advised by the\nCompany, and BofA Securities assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then-currently available estimates and good\nfaith judgments of the management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company. BofA Securities did not make and was not\nprovided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor did it make any physical\ninspection of the properties or assets of the Company. BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Company or Parent under any\nstate, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of the Company, that the\nmergers would be consummated in accordance with their respective terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or\nagreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the\nmergers, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that\nwould have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits of the mergers. BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of the\nCompany, that the final executed merger agreement did not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Securities.\nBofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the mergers (other than the common stock consideration\nto the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the mergers, any related transaction or any other\nagreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or related to the mergers or otherwise. BofA Securities\u2019 opinion was limited to\nthe fairness, from a financial point of view, of the common stock consideration to be received by the holders of our common stock and no opinion or view\nwas expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the mergers by the holders of any other class of securities or any creditors\nor other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount,\nnature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the mergers, or class of such persons,\nrelative to the common\n49\nTable of Contents\nstock consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the mergers in comparison to other strategies\nor transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage or as to the underlying business decision of the Company\nto proceed with or effect the mergers. BofA Securities did not express any opinion with respect to, and relied, at the direction of the Company, upon the\nassessments of representatives of the Company regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to the Company or the mergers\n(including the contemplated benefits thereof), as to which BofA Securities understood that the Company had obtained such advice as the Company\ndeemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should\nvote or act in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter.\nBofA Securities\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to BofA Securities as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect its\nopinion, and BofA Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion was\napproved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities. Except as described above, the Company imposed no other limitations on the\ninvestigations made or procedures followed by BofA Securities in rendering its opinion.\nThe discussion set forth above in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d represents a brief summary of the material\nfinancial analyses presented by BofA Securities to our board of directors in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include\ninformation presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities, the tables must be read together\nwith the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities.\nConsidering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies\nand assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities.\nCompany Financial Analyses\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information of the Company and\nthe following seven selected publicly traded companies with operations in the real estate industry (in the multifamily REIT sector) that BofA Securities\nconsidered generally relevant. BofA Securities noted that none of these selected publicly traded companies in the multifamily sector are directly\ncomparable to the Company, which has operations in the student housing sector. The most directly comparable publicly traded company is Education\nReality Trust, Inc. (\u201cEdR\u201d), which was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on September 20, 2018 as part of the take private transaction by\nGreystar Investment Group, LLC (\u201cGreystar\u201d).\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies\nApartment Income REIT Corp.\nAvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nCamden Property Trust\nEquity Residential\nEssex Property Trust, Inc.\nMid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\nUDR, Inc.\nBofA Securities reviewed, among other things, total enterprise values (\u201cTEVs\u201d) of the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as their equity\nvalues based on their closing stock prices on April 14, 2022 and the\n50\nTable of Contents\nnumber of their fully diluted shares outstanding, plus debt, preferred stock, non-controlling interests, and less cash and cash equivalents, as a multiple of\ncalendar year 2022 estimated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d). Financial data of the selected publicly\ntraded companies were based on public filings and publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates as of April 14, 2022. Financial data of the Company\nwere based on the updated management financial projections.\nBofA Securities also reviewed, among other things, per share equity values, based on closing stock prices on April 14, 2022 of the selected publicly\ntraded companies as a multiple of calendar year 2022 estimated funds from operations (referred to as \u201cFFO\u201d) per share. BofA Securities observed FFO-\nModified (\u201cFFOM\u201d), as provided by the Company\u2019s management, which reflects certain adjustments related to the economic performance of the\nCompany\u2019s on-campus participating properties and excludes other items, as the Company determined in good faith, that do not reflect the Company\u2019s\ncore operations on a comparative basis. Financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on public filings and publicly available\nresearch analysts\u2019 estimates as of April 14, 2022. Financial data of the Company were based on the updated management financial projections.\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies\n2022E\nTEV\n/EBITDA\n2022E\nFFO\nMultiple\nApartment Income REIT Corp.\n24.3x\n21.7x\nAvalonBay Communities, Inc.\n27.0x\n25.6x\nCamden Property Trust\n24.3x\n25.6x\nEquity Residential\n26.1x\n26.1x\nEssex Property Trust, Inc.\n31.5x\n24.8x\nMid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n25.1x\n25.6x\nUDR, Inc.\n26.8x\n25.2x\nOverall Mean\n26.4x\n24.9x\nOverall Median\n26.1x\n25.6x\nThe overall low to high calendar year 2022 estimated TEV / EBITDA multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 24.3x to 27.0x\n(with a mean of 26.4x and a median of 26.1x).\nThe overall low to high calendar year 2022 estimated FFO per share multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 21.7x to 26.1x\n(with a mean of 24.9x and a median of 25.6x).\nBofA Securities then applied the selected range of calendar year 2022 TEV / EBITDA multiples of 21.0x to 25.0x, derived from the selected publicly traded\ncompanies based on BofA Securities\u2019 professional experience and judgment, to the Company\u2019s calendar year 2022 estimated EBITDA of $474 million, as\nset forth in the updated management financial projections, to calculate a range of implied enterprise values for the Company. Estimated financial data of\nthe Company were based on the updated management financial projections. BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges per\nshare of common stock by deducting estimated net debt of $3,416 million as of December 31, 2021, as provided by the Company\u2019s management, from such\nenterprise values and dividing the result by the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding of 141.080 million as of March 31, 2022, based on information\nprovided by the Company\u2019s management. In deriving the selected range of calendar year 2022 TEV / EBITDA multiples, BofA Securities took into\nconsideration, among other things, the observed data for the selected publicly traded companies and for the Company, the historical trading prices of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock and the common stocks of the selected publicly traded companies and the differences in the financial profiles of the Company\nand the selected publicly traded companies.\nSimilarly, BofA Securities applied the selected range of calendar year 2022 estimated FFO per share multiples of 19.0x to 25.0x, derived from the selected\npublicly traded companies based on BofA Securities\u2019 professional experience and judgment, to the Company\u2019s calendar year 2022 estimated FFOM of\n$351 million and divided the result by the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding of 141.080 million as of March 31, 2022,\n51\nTable of Contents\nbased on information provided by the Company\u2019s management. In deriving the selected range of calendar year 2022 FFO per share multiples, BofA\nSecurities took into consideration, among other things, the observed data for the selected publicly traded companies and for the Company, the historical\ntrading prices of the Company\u2019s common stock and the common stocks of the selected publicly traded companies and the differences in the financial\nprofiles of the Company and the selected publicly traded companies.\nThis analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for the Company (rounded to the nearest $0.25), as\ncompared to the common stock consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Ranges Based on:\nCommon Stock\nConsideration\n2022E\nEBITDA\n2022E\nFFOM\n$46.25 - $59.75\n$47.25 - $62.25\n$65.47\nNo company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to the Company. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not\nentirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating\ncharacteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which the Company was compared.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to the following\nthirteen transactions, consisting of the Greystar EdR transaction announced on June 25, 2018 (the \u201cselected transaction\u201d), three transactions in the\nstudent housing sector (referred to as \u201cstudent housing transactions\u201d), and nine transactions in the multifamily sector (referred to as \u201cmultifamily\ntransactions\u201d).\nOf the thirteen transactions, BofA Securities noted that, in its view, based on its professional experience and judgment, the only directly comparable\nprecedent transaction was the selected transaction. The operational and financial characteristics of EdR were most directly comparable to those of the\nCompany.\nDate Announced\nTarget\nAcquiror\nTEV /\nNTM\nEBITDA\nSelected Transaction\nJune 25, 2018\nEducation Realty Trust, Inc.\nGreystar Investment\nGroup, LLC\n22.4x\nOther Student Housing\nTransactions (for reference only)\nJanuary 31, 2018\nHarrison Street Real Estate\nCapital, LLC\nCanada Pension Plan\nInvestment Board (CPPIB),\nGIC Pte.

Based on its professional judgment and experience and after taking into consideration, among other things, the observed\ndata for the selected transaction, BofA Securities then applied a selected range of TEV / NTM EBITDA multiples of 20.4x to 24.4x. Utilizing the TEV\nimplied in the merger consideration and the Company\u2019s estimated 2022 NTM EBITDA of $474 million, based on the updated management financial\nprojections, this analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for the Company (rounded to the nearest\n$0.25), as compared to the common stock consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nBased on:\nCommon Stock\nConsideration\n2022E TEV / NTM EBITDA\n$44.50 - $58.00\n$65.47\nNo company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical to the Company or the mergers. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this\nanalysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which\nthe Company and the mergers were compared.\n53\nTable of Contents\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company to calculate the estimated present value of\nthe standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the Company was forecasted to generate during the Company\u2019s fiscal year 2022 through fiscal\nyear 2027 based on the updated management financial projections. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for the Company by applying a selected\nrange of terminal multiples of 20.0x to 24.0x, based on the historical trading range for the Company\u2019s stock, to the Company\u2019s terminal year estimated\nEBITDA (at share) of $783 million, which was obtained by extrapolating the Company\u2019s 2027 estimated EBITDA (at share) of $757 million at an assumed\ngrowth rate of 3.5%, as provided by the Company\u2019s management. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of\nDecember 31, 2021 using a range of discount rates of 7.50% to 9.00%, reflecting an estimate of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, which\nwas calculated by multiplying the estimated cost of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight, and then adding the products together.\nThe estimated cost of equity was obtained using the capital asset pricing model (which takes into account the risk-free rate, the levered beta and the\napplicable equity market risk premium) and the estimated cost of debt was based on the Company\u2019s estimated borrowing cost. The number of fully-diluted\nshares outstanding was 141.080 million as of March 31, 2022, based on information provided by the Company\u2019s management. This analysis indicated the\nfollowing approximate implied per share equity value reference range for the Company (rounded to the nearest $0.25), as compared to the common stock\nconsideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nCommon Stock\nConsideration\n$40.00 - $60.00\n$65.47\nOther Factors\nBofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities\u2019 material financial analyses with respect to its\nopinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nhistorical trading prices and trading volumes of the common stock, which indicated low and high closing prices for the common stock\nduring the 52-week period ended April 14, 2022 of approximately $43.29 to $58.66 per share\u037e\n\u2022\none-year future stock price targets for the common stock in publicly available research analyst reports, which indicated stock price targets\nfor the Company, of a range of approximately $57.74 to $65.00 per share\u037e\n\u2022\nresearch analysts\u2019 estimates for the Company as reflected in selected publicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019 reports and other\npublicly available information, which indicated, among other things, an overall low to high estimated net asset value per share range for the\nCompany of approximately $55.88 to $66.61 per share\u037e and\n\u2022\nestimated net asset value per share range for the Company, furnished by the Company\u2019s management, of approximately $58.25 to $68.50 per\nshare.\nMiscellaneous\nAs noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Company Financial Analyses\u201d represents a brief summary of the material\nfinancial analyses presented by BofA Securities to our board of directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all\nanalyses undertaken or factors considered by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex\nanalytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those\nmethods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA\nSecurities believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting\n54\nTable of Contents\nportions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or\nthe narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and\nopinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater\nweight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of\nwhich are beyond the control of the Company. The estimates of the future performance of the Company in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested\nby BofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities\u2019 analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of\nthe common stock consideration and were provided to our board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The analyses\ndo not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or acquired or the prices at which any securities have\ntraded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis\ndescribed above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities\u2019 view of the actual value of the Company.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the mergers were determined through negotiations between the Company and Parent, rather than by\nany financial advisor, and were approved by our board of directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of our board of\ndirectors. As described above, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by our board of directors in its\nevaluation of the mergers and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of our board of directors, management or any other party with respect\nto the mergers or the common stock consideration.\nThe Company has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the mergers an aggregate fee that is currently estimated to be $56.34\nmillion, approximately $3 million of which was payable upon the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and the remaining portion of which is contingent\nupon the consummation of the mergers. The Company also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA\nSecurities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers,\nemployees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws. Pursuant to its engagement letter with\nthe Company, BofA Securities would be entitled to a transaction fee from the Company in connection with any merger or similar acquisition transaction,\nirrespective of the identity of the acquirer. Such fee would generally be higher for a transaction that provides for greater merger consideration.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives trading,\nforeign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and\ninvestment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,\ngovernments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of\ncustomers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in equity, debt or\nother securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company, Parent and certain of their respective\naffiliates.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial\nbanking and other financial services to the Company and its affiliates and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of\nthese services, including having acted or acting as (i) financial advisor in connection with certain investment banking transactions and other corporate\nactivity, and (ii) sales agent, underwriter, manager and/or arranger on various debt and equity offerings and financings. From March 1, 2020 through\nFebruary 28, 2022, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from the Company of approximately $6.80 million as determined by BofA\nSecurities based on its books and records.\n55\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking,\ncommercial banking treasury, lending and other financial services to Parent and certain of its affiliates and related companies and have received or in the\nfuture may receive substantial compensation for the rendering of these services, including having acted or acting as (i) financial advisor in connection\nwith various acquisitions, divestures, purchases and sales of assets, and other corporate activity, (ii) underwriter, manager and/or arranger on various\ndebt and equity offerings and financings, and (iii) underwriter and manager in initial public offerings of certain affiliated or related companies. BofA\nSecurities has advised us that from March 1, 2020 through February 28, 2022, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Parent\nand certain of its affiliates of approximately $662 million for investment and corporate banking and other financial services as determined by BofA\nSecurities based on its books and records.\nFinancing\nIn connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $9.2 billion to be paid to the holders of our common stock,\nrestricted stock, deferred stock awards and limited partnership units. Prior to the closing of the mergers, we expect to repay at maturity our $200 million\nterm loan. Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent expects to cause our outstanding indebtedness under our\nrevolving credit facility, if any, to be repaid in full. Parent has also informed us that it expects our mortgage loans and senior unsecured notes to be repaid\nor remain outstanding. As of March 31, 2022, we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $200 million in term loan financing\noutstanding, approximately $535.4 million in mortgage loans and project-based taxable bonds outstanding (including a $330 million mortgage loan made to\nwholly owned subsidiaries of a joint venture in which we own a 55% interest) and $2.8 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding.\nParent has informed us that it has received, in connection with the mergers, a debt commitment letter from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., providing for debt financing\nthrough two balance sheet loans in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $2.1 billion and that it currently intends to pursue additional debt\nfinancing in connection with the mergers. In addition, it is expected that the Sponsor, which is the operating partnership of BREIT, and its affiliates will\ncontribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such debt\nfinancing.\nParent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing may be\nused for purposes such as reserves, paying carrying costs with respect to the properties, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and\nexpenses related to the financing and the mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the debt\nfinancing would be secured by, among other things, a mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned and/or ground leased by us, certain\nescrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable collateral, and\nthat such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings.\nThe merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a \u201cmarket MAC\u201d condition to the closing of the mergers. For more information, see \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Financing Cooperation\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to the Mergers.\u201d\nInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers\nIn considering the recommendation of our board of directors to approve the merger, the merger agreement and the other proposals described above, our\nstockholders should be aware that our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the\ninterests of our stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and\nconsidered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to determine and declare the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, to be advisable and in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests to approve the\n56\nTable of Contents\nexecution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to\nrecommend that the stockholders approve the merger. These interests are discussed below. For a description regarding compensation and benefits to be\nprovided to our employees generally following the merger effective time, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Employee Benefits.\u201d\nTreatment of Compensatory Awards\nOur executive officers hold restricted stock and deferred stock awards, as further set forth in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments\nto Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers.\u201d\nRestricted Stock. The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of restricted stock granted\npursuant to an incentive award plan, other than deferred stock awards, will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights\nthereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger\nagreement and will have the right to receive the common stock consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nDeferred Stock Awards. The merger agreement provides that deferred stock awards will, as of immediately before the merger effective time, become vested\nand no longer subject to restriction, and all deferred stock awards will, at the merger effective time, be adjusted and converted into a right of the holder to\nhave allocated to the holder\u2019s account under the deferred compensation plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of\nshares of common stock allocated to such account as of the merger effective time and (2) the merger consideration, and will no longer represent a right to\nreceive a number of shares of common stock or cash equal to or based on the value of a number of shares of common stock. Payments under our deferred\ncompensation plan will be made in accordance with the timing set forth in the plan and the applicable payment elections for participants in the plan,\nsubject to any right to terminate the plan and accelerate distributions of participant account balances pursuant to the terms of our deferred compensation\nplan and applicable law.\nValue of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would become payable to each of our named executive officers, see\n\u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers\u201d below. The estimated value of the payments\nthat will be made to our other executive officers, Messrs. de C\u00e1rdenas, Wilhelm and Winger and Ms. Ledbetter in respect of their outstanding restricted\nstock and deferred stock awards at the merger effective time (or such later time in accordance with the deferred compensation plan) is $5,816,641 in the\naggregate, which is based on the number of outstanding unvested shares and awards held by these current executive officers as of June 14, 2022.\nTreatment of Interests in the Partnership\nCertain of our executive officers hold fully vested common partnership units as further set forth in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential\nPayments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers.\u201d At the partnership merger effective time, each limited partnership unit, or\nfraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other than excluded common partnership units)\nwill be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock consideration, without interest and\nless any applicable withholding taxes. If we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, or to\navoid or reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the partnership unit\nconsideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the common stock.\nExecutive Severance Benefits\nArrangements. We are party to an employment agreement with each executive officer, which provides for the severance benefits described below upon a\nseverance-qualifying termination of employment. The severance benefits payable to each executive officer will be subject to compliance with the\nrestrictive covenants described below.\n57\nTable of Contents\nEach employment agreement with an executive officer provides that the executive officer may terminate the agreement for \u201cgood reason,\u201d which is defined\nin the employment agreement, in general, as any substantial change by the Company in the nature or scope of the executive officer\u2019s functions, duties,\nresponsibilities or reporting relationships without their express written consent, the requirement that the executive officer be based at a location at least\n50 miles from their current principal location of employment, the Company\u2019s failure to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to assume the\nterms of the employment agreement and the Company\u2019s breach of any material provision of the employment agreement.\nThe employment agreements with executive officers provide that, if the Company terminates an executive officer\u2019s employment without \u201ccause\u201d or the\nexecutive officer terminates employment for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each as defined in the applicable employment agreement), the executive officer will be entitled\nto accrued and unpaid obligations through the date of termination and the following payments and benefits:\n\u2022\nA cash payment equal to 299% for Mr. Bayless and 100% for each other executive officer, in each case times the sum of their then-current\nannual base salary plus the average annual cash bonus paid or payable in respect of the three years immediately prior to the year of\ntermination\u037e\n\u2022\nA prorated cash bonus for the year in which the termination occurs equal to the greater of (i) the annual cash bonus paid or payable in\nrespect to the year immediately prior to the year in which the termination occurs or (ii) the target cash bonus for the year in which the\ntermination occurs\u037e\n\u2022\nHealth benefits for one year following the executive officer\u2019s termination of employment at the same cost to the executive officer as in effect\nimmediately preceding such termination, subject to reduction to the extent that the executive officer receives comparable benefits from a\nsubsequent employer\u037e and\n\u2022\nAll of the executive officer\u2019s unvested shares of restricted stock and deferred stock awards will vest.\nIn addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, if an executive officer\u2019s employment with the Surviving Company is terminated after the merger effective\ntime and on or before December 31, 2022 by the Surviving Company without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, the executive officer will\nbe entitled to a pro-rata portion (based on the period of employment during 2022) of the cash value of the restricted stock award granted to such\nexecutive officer in January 2022 (the \u201cdeferred cash award\u201d) and if such termination of employment occurs on or after January 1, 2023, the executive\nofficer will be entitled to full vesting and payment of the deferred cash award, in each case, to the extent not otherwise payable pursuant to such\nexecutive officer\u2019s employment agreement and subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants described below and a release of claims in favor of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries and Parent.\nGolden Parachute Excise Tax. Pursuant to the employment agreement with Mr. Bayless, if the payments or benefits made or provided to Mr. Bayless\nunder his employment agreement and under any other plan, program or agreement of the Company or its affiliates (the \u201cAggregate Payment\u2019) are or\nbecome subject to any tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code or any similar tax, the Company will pay to Mr. Bayless an additional amount such that\nthe net amount retained by Mr. Bayless with respect to the Aggregate Payment, after deduction of any excise tax on the Aggregate Payment and any\nfederal, state and local income tax and excise tax on such additional payment (and any interest and penalties thereon), but before deduction for any\nfederal, state or local income or employment tax withholding on such Aggregate Payment, shall be equal to the amount of the Aggregate Payment.\nRestrictive Covenants. Any payments payable under the employment agreements are subject to the executive officer\u2019s compliance with certain\nconfidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and non-interference covenants that apply during the executive officer\u2019s employment and for a period\nending on (i) the second anniversary of an executive officer\u2019s termination of employment by the Company for cause or by executive officer without good\nreason, or (ii) the first anniversary of the executive officer\u2019s termination of employment by the Company other than for cause, by the executive officer with\ngood reason or by the executive officer for any reason at any time during the one-year period following a change in control.\n58\nTable of Contents\nValue of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would become payable to each of our\nnamed executive officers upon a severance-qualifying termination, see \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in\nConnection with the Mergers\u201d below. The estimated value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable upon a\nseverance-qualifying termination of employment on September 1, 2022 for our other executive officers, Messrs. de C\u00e1rdenas, Winger and Wilhelm and\nMs. Ledbetter, is $1,314,644, $1,126,043, $1,083,294 and $1,007,527, respectively.\nSection 16(b) Exemption Resolution\nOur board of directors believes that it is desirable that the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers be relieved of the risk of liability under Section 16\nof the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the exchange of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger.\nAccordingly, our board of directors (or a committee thereof) intends to adopt a resolution providing that the disposition by the Company\u2019s executive\nofficers and directors of our common stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the merger, are intended to be exempt from liability under\nSection 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated thereunder.\nIndemnification of Our Directors and Officers\nThe merger agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and after the merger effective time and ending on the sixth\nanniversary of the merger effective time, the Surviving Company will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to: (1) indemnify, defend and hold\nharmless each of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current or former managers, directors, officers and trustees (which persons we refer to as the \u201cindemnified\nparties\u201d), against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and\namounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, cause of action, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitration, mediation, interference, audit,\nassessment, hearing or other legal proceeding (we refer to the foregoing as an \u201caction\u201d), arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission or alleged\naction or omission in such indemnified party\u2019s capacity as a manager, director, officer or trustee of the Company or any of our subsidiaries arising out of\nactions or omissions occurring at or prior to the merger effective time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the merger effective time),\nincluding such alleged acts or omissions with respect to the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,\nincluding the mergers\u037e and (2) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such action the expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and any\nexpenses incurred by any indemnified party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to indemnification) of any indemnified party without the\nrequirement of any bond or other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by law, but subject to Parent\u2019s or the Surviving Company\u2019s receipt\nof an undertaking by or on behalf of such indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such indemnified party is not\nentitled to be indemnified.\nThe parties have agreed not to terminate or modify the obligations described above regarding indemnification of the indemnified parties in such a manner\nas to adversely affect such indemnified parties, and such obligations must be assumed by any successor entity to the Surviving Company as a result of\nany consolidation, merger, dissolution or transfer of all or substantially all of its properties and assets.\nThe merger agreement also requires that, prior to the merger effective time, we will bind, effective at the merger effective time, extended coverage under\nour directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policy by obtaining a prepaid six-year \u201ctail\u201d extended period on our existing officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 liability\ninsurance policies (or with insurers on terms and conditions no less favorable than such policies), which prepaid policies provide such persons currently\ncovered by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before\nthe merger effective time, for an overall additional premium not to exceed 300% of the total annual premiums at the last renewal\u037e provided, that we will\n59\nTable of Contents\nreasonably cooperate and consult with Parent prior to the purchase of any such tail policy\u037e provided, further, that if Parent can procure a \u201ctail\u201d policy on\nsuperior terms or on equivalent terms, but at a lower price, as compared to any such policy that may be procured by us, then, subject to certain terms and\nconditions, Parent may obtain such policy effective as of the merger effective time, in which case we shall not obtain such policy. Additionally, Parent and\nthe Surviving Company are required to maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.\nQuantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about\ncertain compensation for each of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. Solely for purposes of the table below,\nit is assumed that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination immediately following the merger effective time. Such amounts\nhave been calculated assuming the merger effective time occurred on September 1, 2022. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments\ndescribed below, see the discussion under \u201c\u2014Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers\u201d above.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that may be paid or become payable to each of the named executive officers in\nconnection with the mergers pursuant to all applicable compensation plans or agreements, assuming that the merger effective time occurred on September\n1, 2022 and that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination immediately following the merger effective time.

No such\npayments are currently anticipated based on the assumptions set forth above.\n61\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Matters\nWe are unaware of any material federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required for the execution of the merger agreement\nor the completion of the merger or the partnership merger, other than the acceptance for record of the articles of merger with respect to the merger and the\npartnership merger by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, and the filing of the certificate of merger with respect to the\nmerger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.\nLitigation Related to the Mergers\nFollowing the filing of the preliminary proxy statement, plaintiffs filed three separate lawsuits related to the proxy statement. One suit, styled Cody\nCharfauros v. American Campus Communities, et al., No. 1:22-cv-04075, which we refer to as the \u201cCharfauros Lawsuit\u201d was filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York. A second suit, styled as Shiva Stein v. American Campus Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-\n03829-JGK, which we refer to as the \u201cStein Lawsuit,\u201d was also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. A third suit,\nstyled as Samuel Acuna v. American Campus Communities, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-03254, which we refer to as the \u201cAcuna Lawsuit,\u201d was filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\nThe Charfauros Lawsuit names as defendants the Company, the Company\u2019s directors and a former director of the Company who ceased to serve as such\nin 2015 upon his death. The Charfauros Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including the rights,\nauthorities and powers of the special committee, the confidentiality agreements with Blackstone and other counterparties, potential conflicts of interest\ninvolving certain directors and officers of the Company, the value of Company options, restricted stock units, and other equity awards that the\nCompany\u2019s directors and officers will receive in the proposed mergers, details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company\u2019s\nofficers and directors, certain financial projections and metrics, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial\nmetrics to GAAP metrics, and input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities\u2019 analysis. Relying on those allegations, the Charfauros Lawsuit\nasserts, on behalf of an individual plaintiff, a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a \u201ccontrol person\u201d claim\nunder Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a) violations against the members of our board of directors. The Charfauros\nLawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers, rescission of the mergers if the mergers are consummated, the\ndissemination of a revised preliminary proxy statement, an award of damages if the mergers are consummated and an award of plaintiff\u2019s costs, including\nattorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe Stein Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company\u2019s directors. Like the Charfauros Lawsuit, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a claim\nunder Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of\ndirectors. The Stein Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, financial\nmetrics, input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities\u2019 analysis, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics. The Stein\nLawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers unless and until defendants disclose the material information alleged to\nhave been omitted from the proxy statement, rescission of the mergers or rescissory damages if the mergers are consummated, an award of damages and\nan award of plaintiff\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe Acuna Lawsuit, like the Charfauros Lawsuit and the Stein Lawsuit, names as defendants the Company and the Company\u2019s directors and asserts a\nclaim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our\nboard of directors. The Acuna Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections\n(including line items underlying the projections, net income projections and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics), input data\nand assumptions used in BofA Securities\u2019 analysis, potential conflicts of interest involving KeyBank Capital Markets Inc. and potential conflicts of\ninterest involving certain directors and officers of the Company. The Acuna Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed\nmergers, rescission of the mergers or rescissory damages if the mergers are\n62\nTable of Contents\nconsummated, a declaration that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and an award\nof plaintiff\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the mergers from becoming effective in a timely manner.\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit and\nintends to defend against these actions vigorously.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each, as\ndefined below) of shares of common stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of\nthe Code, applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial opinions and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d), each, as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may change at any time, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.\nNo assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described\nbelow. We have not sought and will not seek an advance ruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this section. This summary assumes that\nthe merger will be consummated in accordance with the merger agreement and as described in this proxy statement.\nThis discussion is not a complete description of all tax consequences of the merger and, in particular, does not address any tax consequences arising\nunder the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, any withholding\nconsiderations pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance thereunder\nand the intergovernmental agreements entered into, and laws and regulations promulgated, pursuant thereto or in connection therewith) nor does it\naddress any tax considerations under state, local or non-U.S. laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United\nStates, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\na trust (1) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more \u201cUnited States\npersons\u201d (as defined under the Code) who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) that has a valid election\nin effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person\u037e or\n\u2022\nan estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an\nentity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThis discussion applies only to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders of shares of common stock who hold such shares as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion is for general information purposes only and does\nnot purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular facts\n63\nTable of Contents\nand circumstances, and it does not apply to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example:\n\u2022\ninsurance companies\u037e\n\u2022\ndealers, brokers or traders in securities or currencies\u037e\n\u2022\ntraders in securities who elect to apply the mark-to-market method of accounting\u037e\n\u2022\nbroker-dealers\u037e\n\u2022\npersons acting as nominees or otherwise not as beneficial owners\u037e\n\u2022\nholders subject to the alternative minimum tax\u037e\n\u2022\npersons who are required to recognize income or gain no later than such income or gain is required to be reported on an applicable financial\nstatement\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\ntax-exempt entities and organizations\u037e\n\u2022\nretirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred or advantaged accounts (or persons holding shares of common stock\nthrough such plans or accounts)\u037e\n\u2022\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ncontrolled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies\u037e\n\u2022\npartnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other flow-through entities\n(and investors therein)\u037e\n\u2022\nS corporations\u037e\n\u2022\nREITs\u037e\n\u2022\nregulated investment companies\u037e\n\u2022\nholders who own or have owned at any time, or are deemed to own or to have owned at any time, directly, indirectly or constructively, at\nleast 5% or more, by voting power or value, of our stock\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201cqualified foreign pension funds\u201d (within the meaning of Section 897(1)(2) of the Code) or entities all of the interests in which are held by a\nqualified pension fund\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201cqualified shareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) or investors therein\u037e\n\u2022\nnon-U.S. holders who hold, or have held at any time, directly, indirectly, or constructively, more than 10% of our outstanding shares of\ncommon stock\u037e\n\u2022\nholders who hold shares of common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated or risk reduction\ntransaction\u037e or\n\u2022\nholders who acquired shares of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards, through a tax-\nqualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation.\nIf a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of common stock, the tax\ntreatment of a partner in that partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or\npartnership is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of the merger to it in light of its\nparticular circumstances.\n64\nTable of Contents\nDETERMINING THE ACTUAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO A HOLDER MAY BE COMPLEX AND WILL DEPEND ON A\nHOLDER\u2019S SPECIFIC SITUATION. ALL HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT\nTO THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX LAWS AND ANY POTENTIAL\nCHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.\nTax Classification of the Merger in General\nIt is expected the merger will be treated as (1) the adoption by the Company of a plan of liquidation, and (2) a sale by the Company of all of its assets to\nMerger Sub I (or, if applicable, its regarded owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in exchange for the common stock consideration to be provided to\nthe holders of equity interests in the Company and the assumption of all of the Company\u2019s liabilities, and any other applicable amounts, followed by a\ndistribution of such common stock consideration, and any other applicable amounts, to the holders of equity interests in the Company in liquidation of\nthe Company pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code. As a REIT, the Company is generally entitled to receive a deduction for liquidating\ndistributions, and we anticipate that our deemed liquidating distribution will exceed our taxable income recognized as a result of the merger (together with\nany other undistributed taxable income recognized in the taxable year of the merger). Accordingly, we anticipate that we will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on any gain that we recognize in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nThe remainder of this discussion assumes that the merger will be treated as described above.\nConsequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete\nliquidation of the Company and a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of shares of common stock will\nrecognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received\nwith respect to such U.S. holder\u2019s shares of common stock in the merger, and (2) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of common stock.\nIf a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of common stock at different times and different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted\ntax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of shares of common stock. Any such gain or loss will generally be capital\ngain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger is greater\nthan one year at the time of the merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for reduced\nrates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nA U.S. holder who has held shares of common stock for less than six months at the time of the merger, taking into account the holding period rules of\nSections 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who recognizes a loss on the exchange of such shares of common stock in the merger, will be treated as\nrecognizing a long-term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received from us, or such holder\u2019s share of any designated retained capital\ngains, with respect to such shares.\nConsequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock\nGeneral. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of payments made with respect to such non-U.S. holder\u2019s shares of common\nstock in connection with the merger will depend on various factors,\n65\nTable of Contents\nincluding whether the receipt of such payments is treated as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs pursuant\nto the provisions of FIRPTA. The IRS announced in Notice 2007-55 that it intends to take the position that under current law a non-U.S. holder\u2019s receipt\nof a liquidating distribution from a REIT (including payments made in connection with the merger, which as noted, are expected to be treated as\ndistributions in complete liquidation of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is generally subject to tax under FIRPTA as a distribution to\nthe extent attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs. Although legislation effectively overriding Notice 2007-55 has previously been proposed, it is not\npossible to say if or when any such legislation will be enacted. Accordingly, we intend to take the position that payments made with respect the\nCompany\u2019s shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be subject to tax in accordance with Notice 2007-55, subject to the 10% Exception, as\ndescribed in more detail below. In general, the provisions governing the taxation of distributions by REITs can be less favorable to non-U.S. holders than\nthe taxation of sales or exchanges of REIT stock by non-U.S. holders, and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of\nthese provisions.\nDistribution of Gain from the Disposition of U.S. Real Property Interests. To the extent that the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 applies, and the\n10% Exception described in the next paragraph below does not apply, then, to the extent that payments received by a non-U.S. holder with respect to\nsuch non-U.S. holder\u2019s common stock pursuant to the merger are treated as attributable to gain from the deemed or actual sale of our USRPIs, such\namounts will be treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder, and generally will be subject\nto U.S. federal income tax on a net basis. A corporate non-U.S. holder will also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be\nspecified by an applicable income tax treaty). In addition, 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in the Treasury Regulations) of any such amounts paid to a\nnon-U.S. holder will be withheld and remitted to the IRS.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of our common stock are considered \u201cregularly traded\u201d (within the meaning of the applicable Treasury\nRegulations) on an established securities market located in the United States and the non-U.S. holder did not hold more than 10% of such class of stock\nat any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the merger, the tax treatment and consequences described above would not apply (the \u201c10%\nException\u201d), and non-U.S. holders would instead be subject to the rules described below under \u201c\u2014Taxable Sale of Common Stock.\u201d We believe that\nshares of our common stock are, and will be at the time of the merger, considered regularly traded on an established securities market located in the\nUnited States within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding tax consequences\nof the merger to them.\nTaxable Sale of Common Stock. If both (A) the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 were not to apply to a non-U.S. holder\u2019s receipt of payments with\nrespect to such non-U.S. holder\u2019s shares of common stock pursuant to the merger and (B) either (1) the \u201cpublicly traded exception\u201d (as described below)\napplies or (2) we are a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d (as described below), such that the Company\u2019s shares of common stock do\nnot constitute USRPIs under FIRPTA with respect to such non-U.S. holder, then the non-U.S. holder should not be subject to tax on any gain recognized\nin connection with the receipt of cash consideration payable pursuant to the merger (which, as described above under \u201c\u2014Consequences of the Merger\nto U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock\u201d and subject to the discussion of Notice 2007-55 above, is generally expected to be treated as a distribution\nin complete liquidation of the Company and as amounts received in full payment in exchange for such holder\u2019s shares of common stock) unless: (a) the\ngain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if required pursuant to an applicable\nincome tax treaty, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States\u037e or (b) the non-U.S. holder\nis an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other requirements are met.\nThe \u201cpublicly traded exception\u201d applies to a non-U.S. holder if our common stock is \u201cregularly traded,\u201d as defined by the applicable Treasury\nRegulations, and the non-U.S. holder has held 10% or less of the shares of common stock at all times during the shorter of the period that the non-U.S.\nholder owned such stock or the\n66\nTable of Contents\nfive-year period ending on the date of the merger. We believe that shares of our common stock are, and will be at the time of the merger, considered\nregularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations.\nWe will be a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d at the time of the merger if non-U.S. holders held directly or indirectly less than 50% in\nvalue of shares of our stock at all times during the five-year period ending with the merger. While we believe that the Company has been and currently is\ndomestically controlled as of the date hereof, no assurances can be given that the actual ownership of shares of our stock has been or will be sufficient\nfor us to qualify as a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d at the time of the merger.\nA non-U.S. holder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (or, if an applicable income tax treaty\nrequires, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States) will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on such gain on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder. In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be subject to the\nbranch profits tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain described\nabove.\nA non-U.S. holder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and who meets certain other\nrequirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain recognized in connection with the merger, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital\nlosses of the non-U.S. holder.\nIf a non-U.S. holder\u2019s shares of common stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by such holder on a sale of such stock will be\ntreated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder (and, in the case of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation, the branch profits tax as\ndescribed above).\nIncome Tax Treaties. If a non-U.S. holder is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States, the non-U.S. holder may be able\nto reduce or eliminate certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above, such as the branch profits tax. Non-U.S. holders should\nconsult their tax advisor regarding possible benefits under an applicable income tax treaty.\nU.S. Withholding Tax. As described above, it is not entirely clear whether the receipt of payments pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder will be\ntreated as a sale or exchange of shares of common stock (if Notice 2007-55 does not apply) or as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to\ngain from the deemed sale of the Company\u2019s USRPIs in the merger (if Notice 2007-55 does apply and the holder does not qualify for the 10% Exception\ndescribed above). Accordingly, we intend to withhold, pursuant to FIRPTA, U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in\napplicable Treasury Regulations) from the portion of the consideration paid to a non-U.S. holder to the extent attributable to gains that the Company\nrecognizes from sales of USRPIs, unless such non-U.S. holder qualifies for the 10% Exception described above. A non-U.S. holder may be entitled to a\nrefund or credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, with respect to any amount withheld pursuant to FIRPTA\u037e provided that the\nrequired information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisor regarding withholding tax considerations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding may apply to payments made in connection with the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however,\nto a holder of shares of common stock who (1) in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that such holder is\nnot subject to backup withholding on an IRS Form W-9, and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules\u037e (2) in\nthe case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes an applicable IRS Form W-8\u037e or (3) provides\n67\nTable of Contents\nproof that such holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with other applicable rules and certification requirements. Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder\u2019s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability, if any, so long as such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.\nTHIS DISCUSSION OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY\nAND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC\nTAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX\nLAWS.\nDelisting of Our Common Stock and Deregistration of Our Common Stock",
