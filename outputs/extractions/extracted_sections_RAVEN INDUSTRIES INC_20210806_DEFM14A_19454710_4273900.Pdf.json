As a result of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary\nwill cease, and Raven will survive the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of CNH Industrial.\nUpon consummation of the Merger, your shares of Raven common stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration described\nbelow. As a result, you will not own any shares of the surviving corporation, and you will no longer have any interest in its future earnings or growth. As a\nresult of the Merger, Raven will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be wholly owned by CNH Industrial. Following consummation of the Merger,\nRaven\u2019s common stock will be de-listed from the Nasdaq and Raven will no longer be subject to reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).\nMerger Consideration (see page 51)\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Raven shareholders will have the right to receive $58.00 in cash,\nwithout interest (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d), for each share of Raven common stock that they own immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for shares\nowned by Raven, CNH Industrial or any of their respective subsidiaries).\nTreatment of Company Equity and Performance-Based Cash Awards (see page 52)\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding equity awards of the Company will be treated as follows:\nEach restricted stock unit entitling the holder to the delivery of Raven common stock upon satisfaction of vesting or other forfeiture conditions, whether\nsettled in cash or in Raven common stock (a \u201cRaven RSU\u201d) that is outstanding under Raven\u2019s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, Raven\u2019s Amended and Restated\n2010 Stock Incentive Plan or Raven\u2019s Deferred Stock Compensation Plan for Directors of Raven (together, the \u201cRaven Stock Plans\u201d), whether vested or not\nvested, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number\nof shares of Raven common stock represented by the Raven RSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven RSU will automatically\nvest and be paid or distributed to the holder of such Raven RSU. To the extent the number of shares of Raven common stock underlying a Raven RSU is\nbased on the satisfaction of performance conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed to have been earned at the greater of (i) the target amount\nunder the terms of the applicable award agreement and (ii) the amount based on the actual performance level achieved under such award agreement based on\nperformance through the Effective Time, such performance to be determined by Raven\u2019s reasonable determination of performance as of immediately prior to\nthe Effective Time. Any payment in respect of Raven RSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred\ncompensation subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and that are not permitted to be paid without\ntriggering a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable\naward agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.\n2\nTable of Contents\nEach director deferred stock unit entitling a director to the delivery of Raven common stock upon satisfaction of vesting or other forfeiture conditions,\nwhether settled in cash or in Raven common stock (a \u201cRaven DSU\u201d), that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether vested or not vested, will\nautomatically be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares\nof Raven common stock represented by the Raven DSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven DSU will automatically vest and\nbe paid or distributed to the holder of such Raven DSU. Any payment in respect of Raven DSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven DSUs that\nconstitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid without triggering a tax or penalty\nunder Section 409A of the Code will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not\ntrigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.\nEach option to acquire shares of Raven common stock (a \u201cRaven Stock Option\u201d) that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether or not vested or\nexercisable, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if\nany, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Raven Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Raven common stock\nunderlying the Raven Stock Option. Any Raven Stock Option for which the exercise price is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be\ncanceled without any consideration.\nRecommendation of the Raven Board of Directors (see page 35)\nAfter careful consideration, the Board approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nCertain factors considered by the Board in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement can be found in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Raven\u2019s Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 32 of this proxy\nstatement.\nThe Board recommends that Raven shareholders vote:\n\u00b7\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u00b7\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Raven to its named\nexecutive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger\u037e and\n\u00b7\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the\nproposal to approve the Merger Agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve the Merger Agreement.\nOpinion of Raven\u2019s Financial Advisor (see page 35)\nPursuant to an engagement letter dated April 8, 2021, Raven retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger and to\ndeliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed Merger.\nAt the meeting of the Board on June 20, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the\nvarious factors, assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of\nRaven common stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan confirmed its June 20, 2021 oral opinion by\ndelivering its written opinion to the Board, dated June 20, 2021, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Raven common\nstock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated June 20, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and\nlimits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P.\nMorgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Raven\u2019s shareholders are urged to read the\nopinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its\nevaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the Merger Consideration to be paid in the proposed\n3\nTable of Contents\nMerger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration to the holders\nof any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Raven or as to the underlying decision by Raven to engage in the proposed Merger. The\nopinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Raven as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or\nany other matter.\nFor additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Opinion of Raven\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 35 and Annex B to\nthis proxy statement.\nFinancing of the Merger (see page 48)\nCompletion of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. CNH Industrial has represented in the Merger Agreement that it has, or will have at the\nEffective Time, sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to consummate the Merger.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 77)\nThe exchange of Raven common stock for cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under\nstate and local and other tax laws. You should read the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page\n77 of this proxy statement and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you in your particular\ncircumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.\nRegulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger (see page 48)\nThe completion of the Merger is conditioned on, among other things, certain specified regulatory approvals having been obtained and remaining in full force\nand effect (or, in the case of certain specified regulatory approvals that are statutory waiting periods, having expired or been terminated), including the\nexpiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the receipt of CFIUS approval.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of Raven and CNH Industrial have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to\nbe taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any government authority or other third party all\ndocumentation to effect all necessary filings and obtaining certain specified regulatory approvals.\nThe Company and CNH Industrial filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on July 12, 2021. The waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act is expected to expire on August 11, 2021. The parties submitted to CFIUS a draft Joint Voluntary Notice on July 30, 2021. The parties\nsubmitted to DDTC the required 60-day Pre-Notification of the Merger on July 30, 2021. In accordance with the National Industrial Security Program\nOperating Manual, the parties notified DCSA of the Merger on July 8, 2021.\nUnder the Austrian Cartel Act, the Merger may not be completed until the expiration of a four-week waiting period following the filing of a notification with\nthe Austrian Federal Competition Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d). CNH Industrial filed such notification with the FCA in connection with the Merger formally on August\n2, 2021. Unless extended or earlier terminated, the applicable waiting period will expire on August 30, 2021.\nSee the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 62 of this proxy\nstatement for a more detailed discussion of the parties\u2019 obligations with respect to obtaining regulatory approvals in connection with the Merger.\nExpected Timing of the Merger (see page 67)\nWe expect to complete the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Merger is subject to various conditions, however, and it is possible that factors outside\nthe control of Raven or CNH Industrial could result in the Merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time\nbetween the special meeting and the completion of the Merger. We expect to complete the Merger promptly following the satisfaction or, to the extent\npermitted, waiver of the other conditions to the consummation of the Merger. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to Completion of\nthe Merger\u201d beginning on page 67 of this proxy statement.\nConditions to Completion of the Merger (see page 67)\nAs more fully described in this proxy statement and in the Merger Agreement, each party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger depends on a number of\nconditions being satisfied, including:\n\u00b7\napproval of the Merger Agreement by an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of outstanding shares of Raven common\nstock at Raven\u2019s shareholder

specified regulatory approvals having been obtained and, in each case, such approvals are not conditioned on CNH Industrial taking\nany action that would constitute a materially burdensome regulatory condition (as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014\nRegulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger\u201d)\u037e\n\u00b7\nsubject to certain qualifications, the other party having performed in all material respects all of its obligations under the Merger Agreement\ncontemplated to be performed by it at or prior to the Effective Time\u037e

agreed that from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of the Merger\nAgreement in accordance with its terms, except as otherwise set forth below, Raven and its subsidiaries will not, and will cause their respective directors,\nofficers and employees, and instruct their investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other advisors

merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar\ninstrument relating to an acquisition proposal\u037e or\n\u00b7\npublicly propose to do any of the foregoing.\nRaven also agreed in the Merger Agreement to (and agreed to cause its subsidiaries to) cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing\nactivities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party and its representatives with respect to any acquisition proposal and to send written notice\ndemanding that any such third party or its representatives in possession of non-public information in respect of Raven or its subsidiaries return or destroy all\nsuch information, and that it would promptly terminate all physical and electronic data access previously granted to such persons.\nNotwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, (i) Raven or any of its representatives receives a\nbona fide acquisition proposal that the Board reasonably believes, after consultation with Raven\u2019s financial advisor, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead\nto a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d (as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals\u201d) and (ii) the\nBoard determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be\ninconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Raven may provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third\nparty. Raven must deliver prior written notice to CNH Industrial advising that it intends to provide such information or engage in such discussions or\nnegotiations, and Raven must keep CNH Industrial promptly informed of the status and material terms of any such discussions or negotiations with the\napplicable third party with respect to any acquisition proposal.\nChanges in Board Recommendation (see page 61)\nAt any time prior to obtaining the approval of Raven\u2019s shareholders, the Board is permitted to make an adverse recommendation change (i) following receipt\nof a superior proposal that did not result from a willful and material breach of the no-shop covenant or (ii) in response to an \u201cintervening event\u201d (as described\nin the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Changes in Board Recommendation\u201d), in each case, only if the Board determines in good faith, after\nconsultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under\napplicable law\u037e provided that:\n\u00b7\nRaven promptly notifies CNH Industrial in writing at least five business days before taking such action, attaching (A) in the case of an adverse\nrecommendation change to be made following receipt of a superior proposal, the most current version of the proposed agreement under which\nsuch superior proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the third party making the superior proposal, or (B) in the case of an\nadverse recommendation change to be made pursuant to an intervening event, a reasonably detailed description of the reasons for making such\nadverse recommendation change\u037e\n\u00b7\nRaven negotiates in good faith with CNH Industrial (if requested by CNH Industrial) for five business days following such notice regarding any\nproposal by CNH Industrial to amend the terms of the Merger Agreement in response to such potential adverse recommendation change\u037e and\n\u00b7\nThe Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Raven\u2019s financial advisor, that CNH Industrial has not\nmade, within such five business day period, an offer that (A) in the case of any adverse recommendation change to be made following receipt of\na superior proposal, is at least as favorable to Raven\u2019s shareholders as such superior proposal (it being understood and agreed that any\namendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such superior proposal shall require a new written notification from Raven and a new\nthree business day period) or (B) in the case of an adverse recommendation change to be made pursuant to an intervening event, obviates the\nneed for such adverse recommendation change.\n6\nTable of Contents\nThe Board may, at any time prior to, but not after, the Shareholder Approval has been obtained, change its recommendation with respect to the Merger\nAgreement following the receipt of an acquisition proposal that it determines to be a superior proposal and terminate the Merger Agreement\u037e provided that\nRaven (i) has complied with the

entered into by Raven (provided that all references to \u201c25% or more\u201d in\nthe definition of acquisition proposal will be deemed to be a reference to \u201cmore than 50%\u201d).\nRegulatory Termination Fee (see page 70)\nCNH Industrial has agreed to pay Raven a termination fee of $200 million under certain circumstances if the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection\nwith a failure to obtain required regulatory approvals. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 70\nof this proxy statement.\nRemedies\u037e Maximum Liability (see page 70)\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, upon any termination of the Merger Agreement under circumstances where the termination fee is payable by Raven\nand the termination fee is paid in full, CNH Industrial and Merger Subsidiary will be precluded from any other remedy against Raven, at law or in equity or\notherwise, and neither CNH Industrial nor Merger Subsidiary will seek to obtain any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential,\nindirect or punitive damages, against Raven or any of Raven\u2019s subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners,\n8\nTable of Contents\nmanagers, members, shareholders or affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated\nthereby.\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that, upon any termination of the Merger Agreement under circumstances where the regulatory termination fee is\npayable by CNH Industrial and such termination fee is paid in full, Raven will be precluded from any other remedy against CNH Industrial, at law or in equity\nor otherwise, and Raven will not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect or punitive damages,\nagainst CNH Industrial or any of CNH Industrial\u2019s subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members,\nshareholders or affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the termination fee is not payable by Raven and the regulatory termination fee is not\npayable by CNH Industrial, the Merger Agreement will become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any shareholder, director, officer,\nemployee, agent, consultant or representative of such party)\u037e provided that, if such termination results from the intentional (i) failure of either party to fulfill a\ncondition to the performance of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure of either party to perform a covenant hereof, such party will be fully liable for\nany and all liabilities and damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and\nmay include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a party\u2019s shareholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other\ncombination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such party) incurred or suffered by the other\nparty as a result of such failure.\nSpecific Performance (see page 70)\nThe Merger Agreement provides that the parties will be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to specifically enforce the\nperformance of the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in\naddition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.\nNo Appraisal Rights (see page 49)\nUnder Section 47-1A-1302.1 of South Dakota Law, the holders of Raven common stock will not have appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.\nThe Special Meeting (see page 21)\nTo attend the virtual special meeting, you must pre-register by visiting register.proxypush.com/ravn and following the registration instructions on that\nwebsite before the meeting begins. You will need to enter the control number that is provided on your proxy card to be able to pre-register. Upon pre-\nregistering, you will receive a confirmation email.\nApproximately one hour before the special meeting, all those who have pre-registered will receive an email with a unique website link that will allow them to\naccess and participate in the meeting, including listening to the full webcast, submitting questions, voting and viewing a list of shareholders entitled to vote\nat the meeting. To view this list of shareholders during the meeting, you will need to enter your control number. You will also have the opportunity to submit\nquestions during the pre-registration process. We plan to respond to all appropriate questions during the webcast.\nEntrance to the special meeting will open 15 minutes before the designated start time. We recommend that you access the meeting website prior to the\ndesignated start time to ensure that you are logged in when the meeting begins. Technical support will be available before and during the virtual special\nmeeting\u037e if you encounter any technical difficulties accessing or participating in the meeting, please call the technical support number that will be provided in\nthe email that will be sent approximately one hour before the meeting. The pre-registration website will also include an email address for technical support.\nPlease note that recording the special meeting will not be permitted.\nThe special meeting is being held in order to consider and vote on the following:\n\u00b7\nA proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u201d and \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement,\u201d beginning on pages 26 and 50, respectively, of this proxy statement\u037e\n9\nTable of Contents\n\u00b7\nA proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Raven to its named executive officers\nthat is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, discussed under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Interests of Raven\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement\u037e and\n\u00b7\nA proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to\napprove the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve the Merger Agreement.\nOnly holders of record of Raven common stock at the close of business on August 4, 2021, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to notice of,\nand to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. At the close of business on the record date, 35,917,637 shares of Raven\ncommon stock were issued and outstanding, approximately 2% of which were held by Raven\u2019s directors and executive officers. We currently expect that all of\nRaven\u2019s directors and all executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the other proposals to be\nconsidered at the special meeting, although no director or executive officer is obligated to do so.\nThe presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Raven common\nstock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business\nto be conducted at the special meeting. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted for\npurposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present, a majority of the Raven shareholders present or\nrepresented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereat may adjourn the special meeting from time to time. Failure of a quorum to be\nrepresented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Raven to additional expense.\nYou may cast one vote for each share of Raven common stock that you own at the close of business on the record date. Approval of the Merger Agreement\nrequires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance\nvia the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting (provided that a quorum is present). The proposal to\napprove, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Raven to its named executive officers that is based on or\notherwise relates to the Merger requires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured\nby the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting (provided that a quorum\nis present). The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies, requires that the number of votes cast\nin favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website or\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting (provided a quorum is present or represented by proxy).\nAn abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the special\nmeeting, abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Because the proposals require that the number of votes cast in favor of the\nproposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website or represented by\nproxy at the special meeting, abstentions and a failure to vote (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a\nbeneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a broker, bank or other nominee to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee) are not\ntreated as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of such proposals.\nIf no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted\nfor (i) the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be\npaid by Raven to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger\u037e and (iii) the proposal to approve the adjournment of the\nspecial meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve the Merger\nAgreement.\n10\nTable of Contents\nInterests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 42)\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board to approve the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that Raven\u2019s directors and executive officers have\ninterests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Raven\u2019s shareholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests and\nconsidered them, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and in recommending\nto Raven\u2019s shareholders that the Merger Agreement be approved. These interests are described in further detail and quantified below under \u201cThe Merger\n(Proposal 1)\u2014Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement.\nDirectors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Indemnification (see page 66)\nFor six years after the Effective Time, CNH Industrial has agreed to, and to cause the surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and\nformer directors and officers of Raven, exclusively in their capacity as such, in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the\nfullest extent provided under South Dakota Law and Raven\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect on June 20, 2021.\nMarket Prices of Raven Common Stock (see page 71)\nThe Merger Consideration of $58.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 50% over Raven\u2019s closing share price on June 18, 2021, the last trading\nday prior to the announcement that Raven had entered into the Merger Agreement, and a premium of approximately 34% to Raven\u2019s thirty (30)-day volume-\nweighted average stock price on the same date. The closing price of Raven common stock on the Nasdaq on August 5, 2021, the most recent practicable date\nprior to the date of this proxy statement, was $58.31 per share.

Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06215 (S.D.N.Y.), Hopkins v. Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06363 (S.D.N.Y.) and Maluga v.\nRaven Industries, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06636 (S.D.N.Y.), alleging that a preliminary version of the proxy statement filed with the SEC on July 19, 2021\nwas materially incomplete, false or misleading in certain respects, thereby allegedly violating Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7\n78n(a), 78t(a)), and SEC Rule 14a-9 (17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9) or 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.100 promulgated thereunder. Each complaint names as defendants Raven and each\nmember of the Raven board of directors and purports to seek injunctive relief and money damages, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. The defendants\nbelieve the allegations in the action are without merit.\n1\n1\nTable of Contents",

The Board\nwas aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in\nrecommending that the Merger Agreement be approved by the shareholders of Raven. See \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Raven Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 42 and \u201cAdvisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation (Proposal\n2)\u201d beginning on page 73.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\n14\nTable of Contents\nA:\nIn order to complete the Merger, Raven must obtain the Shareholder Approval of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement described in this\nproxy statement, and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement must be satisfied or waived. The parties to the Merger Agreement\ncurrently expect to complete the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2021, although Raven cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all.\nBecause the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, the exact timing of the Merger cannot be determined at this time.\nQ:\nWhat conditions must be satisfied to complete the Merger?\nA:\nThere are several conditions which must be satisfied to complete the Merger, including, among other things, the expiration or termination of any\napplicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the receipt of CFIUS approval, compliance with certain other regulatory filings and obtaining certain\nother regulatory approvals. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned on the other party\u2019s representations and\nwarranties being true and correct (subject generally to a material adverse effect standard, with different standards applicable to certain\nrepresentations and warranties) and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement (subject to\ncertain qualifications).

Approval of this proposal by Raven\u2019s shareholders is not required to\ncomplete the Merger.\nQ:\nDo you expect the Merger to be taxable to Raven shareholders?\nA:\nThe exchange of Raven common stock for cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be\ntaxable under state and local and other tax laws. You should read the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the\nMerger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is August 4, 2021. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date are entitled to attend and\nvote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. The only class of stock that can be voted at the meeting is Raven common\nstock. Each outstanding share of Raven common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the meeting. At the close of business\non the record date, there were 35,917,637 shares of Raven common stock issued and outstanding, approximately 2% of which were held by Raven\u2019s\ndirectors and executive officers. We currently expect that all of Raven\u2019s directors and all executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the\nproposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although no director or executive\nofficer is obligated to do so.\nQ:\nWho may attend the special meeting?\nA:\nOnly shareholders as of the close of business on August 4, 2021, or their duly appointed proxies, and invited guests of Raven may attend the\nmeeting via the virtual meeting website. \u201cStreet name\u201d holders (those whose shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee) who wish to\nvote at the special meeting must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote your\nshares at the special meeting.\nQ:\nWho is soliciting my vote?\nA:\nThe Board is soliciting your proxy, and Raven will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. MacKenzie Partners has been retained to assist with the\nsolicitation of proxies. MacKenzie Partners will be paid a solicitation fee of approximately $15,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-\npocket expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting.

Box 5107, Sioux Falls, South Dakota 57117-5107\u037e or\n\u00b7\nYou may attend the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) and vote via the virtual meeting website.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIf your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other\nnominee to change or revoke your proxy.\nIf you have questions about how to vote or change your vote, please contact MacKenzie Partners, the firm assisting us in the solicitation of proxies,\ntoll-free at (800) 322-2885 or call (212) 929-5500 or email RAVNproxy@mackenziepartners.com.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Raven common stock before the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of the Merger. If you own shares of common stock as of the close of\nbusiness on the record date but transfer your shares prior to the date of the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting,\nbut the right to receive the Merger Consideration will pass to the person who holds your shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Raven common stock after the special meeting but before the Effective Time?\nA:\nIf you transfer your shares after the special meeting but before the Effective Time, you will have transferred the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of common\nstock through completion of the Merger.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. If the Merger is completed, the exchange agent for the Merger will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your shares of\nRaven common stock for the Merger Consideration.\nPLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY OR OTHERWISE SEND THEM TO RAVEN, CNH INDUSTRIAL\nOR THE PROXY SOLICITOR.\nQ:\nHow many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?\nA:\nThe presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Raven\ncommon stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a\nquorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present, a majority of the Raven shareholders present or represented\nby proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereat may adjourn the special meeting from time to time. Failure of a quorum to be present at\nthe special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Raven to additional expense.\nQ:\nWhat if I abstain from voting?\nA:\nIf you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal, your shares will still be counted for\npurposes of determining whether a quorum exists. If you abstain from voting on any of the three proposals, it will have no effect on the outcome of\nsuch proposals.\nQ:\nWill my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote over the internet, by mail, by telephone or by attendance via the virtual\nmeeting website?\nA:\nIf you are a registered shareholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote over the internet, by telephone, by mail or by attendance\nvia the virtual meeting website, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a\nquorum exists.\nIf your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or other nominee\nmay vote your shares at its discretion on routine matters, but may not vote your shares on non-routine matters such as the proposals to be voted\nupon at the special meeting. Accordingly, if your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you do not issue instructions to your broker, bank or other\nnominee, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.\nIf you fail to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card by mail, or vote via the internet, by telephone or by attendance via the virtual meeting\nwebsite, it will have no effect on the proposals.\nQ:\nWhat is a broker non-vote?\n17\nTable of Contents\nA:\nBroker non-votes are shares held by brokers and other record holders with respect to which the broker or other record holder is not instructed by the\nbeneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal.\nBecause brokers and other record holders do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this\nproxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares of Raven common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d does not give voting instructions to the broker or\nother holder of record, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the special meeting. As a result, it is expected that there will\nnot be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement.\nIf you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted. A failure to instruct your broker, bank or\nother nominee to vote on the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement (assuming a quorum is present), the non-binding proposal regarding\nmerger-related compensation for Raven\u2019s named executive officers (assuming a quorum is present) or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting\n(assuming a quorum is present), including if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the approval of the Merger Agreement, will have no effect on\nthe outcome of such proposals.\nQ:\nWill my shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder than any shares you hold of record, any\nshares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms,\nsuch as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy\ncard for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be voted\nby an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?\nA:\nThis means you own shares of Raven common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For example, you may\nown some shares directly as a shareholder of record and other shares through a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker. In\nthese situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for\nany alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you receive\ncomes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that\naccompanies that proxy card.\nQ:\nWho will count the votes?\nA:\nA representative from EQ Shareowner Services will serve as the inspector of election.\nQ:\nCan I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?\nA:\nIf you are unable to attend the meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card or to vote over the internet or by\ntelephone.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nA:\nRaven intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be\nfiled with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Raven files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not approved by Raven shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Raven shareholders will not\nreceive any payment for their shares of Raven common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, Raven will remain an independent public\ncompany and shares of Raven common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, Raven will be required to pay to CNH\nIndustrial a termination fee of $64 million. The Merger Agreement also provides that CNH Industrial will be required to pay the Company a\ntermination fee of $200 million under certain circumstances if the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a failure to obtain required\nregulatory approvals. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee Payable by Raven\u201d beginning on page 69 of this proxy\nstatement and the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 70 for a discussion of the\ncircumstances under which such termination fees will be required to be paid.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain additional information about Raven?\nA:\nRaven will provide copies of this proxy statement and its 2021 Annual Report to shareholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2021, without charge to any shareholder who makes a written request to the Office of the Corporate Secretary at Raven\nIndustries, Inc., 205 E. 6th Street, P.O. Box 5107, Sioux Falls, South Dakota 57117-5107. Raven\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings\nmay also be accessed at www.sec.gov or on the Investor Relations section of Raven\u2019s website at www.ravenind.com. Raven\u2019s website address is\nprovided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is not part of this proxy statement and\nis not incorporated in this proxy statement by reference by this or any other reference to our website provided in this proxy statement.\nQ:\nHow many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another shareholder?\nA:\nThe SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and\nannual reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as\napplicable, addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d potentially provides extra\nconvenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies.\nRaven and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple shareholders who request a copy and\nshare an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker\nor us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke\nyour consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual\nreport, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Raven if you are a shareholder of record. You can notify us by\nsending a written request to P.O. Box 5107 Sioux Falls, South Dakota 57117-5107 Attn: Office of the Corporate Secretary, or calling (605) 336-2750.\nShareholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they receive a single\ncopy by notifying Raven at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In addition, Raven will promptly deliver, upon written or oral\nrequest to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single\ncopy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.\nQ:\nWhom should I contact if I have any questions?\nA:\nIf you have questions about the Merger or the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting or desire additional copies of this proxy statement\nor additional proxy cards or otherwise need assistance voting, you should contact:\n1407 Broadway, 27th Floor\nNew York, NY 10018\nShareholders May Call Toll-Free: (800) 322-2885\nOr Call: (212) 929-5500\nOr Email: RAVNproxy@mackenziepartners.com\n19\nTable of Contents\nCAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",

If Raven shareholders fail to approve the Merger Agreement, the Merger\nwill not occur. The vote on named executive compensation payable in connection with the Merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the\nMerger Agreement. Accordingly, a shareholder may vote to approve the named executive compensation payable in connection with the Merger and vote not\nto approve the Merger Agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on named executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on\neither Raven or CNH Industrial. Accordingly, because Raven is contractually obligated to pay the compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject\nonly to the conditions applicable thereto, if the Merger Agreement is approved and the Merger is consummated, and regardless of the outcome of the\nadvisory vote.\nRaven does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

            "text": "Effects on Raven If the Merger Is Not Completed\nIf the Merger Agreement is not approved by Raven shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Raven shareholders will not receive\nany payment for their shares of Raven common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, Raven will remain an independent public company and shares\nof Raven common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, Raven shareholders will continue to\nbe subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the industry in which Raven\noperates, the servicing of Raven\u2019s debt, market volatility and adverse economic conditions.\nFurthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the Merger not to be completed, it is likely that the\nprice of Raven common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Raven common stock would return to the\nprice at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of\nRaven common stock. If the Merger Agreement is not approved by Raven shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be\nno assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Raven will be offered or that Raven\u2019s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely\nimpacted.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, Raven will be required to pay to\nCNH Industrial a termination fee of $64 million. The Merger Agreement also provides that CNH Industrial will be required to pay the Company a termination\nfee of $200 million under certain circumstances if the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a failure to obtain required regulatory approvals. See\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee Payable by Raven\u201d beginning on page 69 of this proxy statement and the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 70 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which\nsuch termination fees will be required to be paid.\nBackground of the Merger",

Commencing in October of 2020,\nrepresentatives of the Company engaged in a series of discussions with CNH Industrial to explore a potential joint venture arrangement between the two\ncompanies regarding precision agriculture. These discussions did not relate to a potential acquisition of the Company by CNH Industrial. As part of this\nprocess, and pursuant to the mutual confidentiality agreement, the Company and CNH Industrial provided each other certain non-public due diligence\ninformation. The Company and CNH Industrial entered into an amended and restated mutual confidentiality agreement on March 11, 2021 (the\n\u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d). CNH Industrial also agreed to a customary standstill provision, expiring 90 days after the date of the Confidentiality\nAgreement.\nIn December 2020, a party (\u201cBidder 1\u201d) contacted the Company to discuss strategic options, including whether the Company would be interested in a sale of\nthe company to Bidder 1. In January of 2021, the Company communicated to Bidder 1 that it would not continue discussions regarding a possible sale of the\nCompany to Bidder 1.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOn March 11, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, who at the time\nwas providing financial advisory services to the Company pursuant to a separate engagement, in attendance. The Board discussed an update on the\ndiscussions with CNH Industrial regarding a potential joint venture arrangement and the possibility of exploring other potential strategic alternatives.\nOn March 16, 2021, the Board engaged Davis Polk as outside legal counsel and met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in attendance. The Board reviewed with the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk the substance of the\ndiscussions with CNH Industrial, as well as other potential strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company. Representatives of J.P. Morgan\npresented a proposed process and timeline with respect to the exploration of potential strategic alternatives for the Company, and representatives of Davis\nPolk provided an overview of the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties. After discussion, the Board authorized the Company, under the direction of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement, to explore potential strategic alternatives in accordance with the proposed process and timeline presented at the Board meeting and to terminate\nthe ongoing discussions with CNH Industrial regarding a possible joint venture arrangement.\nOn March 17, 2021, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company informed CNH Industrial of the Company\u2019s decision to no longer pursue a\npossible joint venture arrangement with CNH Industrial and to instead initiate a process to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the\nentire company.\nOn March 18, 2021, the Company and CNH Industrial entered into a supplement to the Confidentiality Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed that,\nnotwithstanding the standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement, CNH Industrial would be permitted to make confidential proposals to the\nCompany\u2019s Board concerning an acquisition of the entire company.\nOn March 30, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in\nattendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan updated the Board on the status of the strategic alternatives process. The Board then discussed formally\nengaging J.P. Morgan as the Company\u2019s financial advisor in connection with a potential strategic transaction. Following discussion, the Board authorized the\nengagement of J.P. Morgan for that purpose.\nOn April 8, 2021, the Company entered into an engagement letter with J.P. Morgan with respect to its retention as a financial advisor in connection with a\npossible strategic transaction.\nOn April 12, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in\nattendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan updated the Board on the status of the strategic alternatives process and presented to the Board the list of\npotential counterparties that members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan planned to reach out to. Members of the\nCompany\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan also discussed with the Board an additional company (\u201cCompany X\u201d) that members of the\nCompany\u2019s senior management, following discussions with representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan, determined not to include in the process due to\ncompetitive concerns and concerns regarding Company X\u2019s ability to obtain regulatory approval for a transaction with the Company. Following discussion,\nthe Board determined that management should proceed to contact the potential counterparties identified at the meeting, and agreed with the determination of\nmanagement to not contact Company X.\nOn April 12, 2021, at the direction of the Company, J.P. Morgan and members of the Company\u2019s management contacted six parties, including CNH Industrial,\nto assess their level of interest in pursuing a potential strategic transaction with the Company. Of those six parties, two parties executed confidentiality\nagreements with the Company on April 16, 2021, and one party executed a mutual confidentiality agreement with the Company on April 19, 2021. All of the\nconfidentiality agreements contained a customary standstill provision. The Company and CNH Industrial also amended the Confidentiality Agreement on\nApril 15, 2021 to add a conflicts waiver with respect to the Company\u2019s outside legal counsel.At the direction of the Company, between April 12, 2021 and April 19, 2021, J.P. Morgan sent process letters to the four parties that had executed\nconfidentiality agreements with the Company, including CNH Industrial, inviting them to submit first-round, non-binding proposals for an acquisition of the\nCompany by May 4, 2021. The letters stated that all first-round proposals should include an indication of the total price the bidder would be prepared to pay\nto acquire 100% of the Company and to specify the bidder\u2019s proposed form of consideration, key conditions and assumptions, intended business and\nmanagement strategy for the Company, financing sources, required approvals, anticipated timing, due diligence requirements and proposed transaction\nstructure.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOn April 22, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in\nattendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan updated the Board on the status of the strategic alternatives process.\nOn April 26, 2021, a representative of Company X contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan who historically have served as relationship bankers to Company\nX, which individuals subsequently contacted members of the Raven coverage team at J.P. Morgan (who are also members of the Raven deal team) to inquire\nwhether there was an ongoing process by the Company to explore a sale. After speaking with the Company, based on the discussion previously held at the\nApril 12 Board meeting, at the direction of the Company, the representatives of J.P. Morgan serving on the Raven coverage team (who are also members of the\nRaven deal team) did not provide information to Company X or its relationship bankers concerning whether or not a process was ongoing.\nOn April 30, 2021, Bidder 1 submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for consideration per share in a range of between $47.00 to $51.00.\nOn May 4, 2021, the Company received additional non-binding proposals to acquire the Company from another party (\u201cBidder 2\u201d) and CNH Industrial,\nresulting in a total of three first-round proposals. CNH Industrial offered to purchase the Company for consideration per share of $48.00. Bidder 2 offered to\npurchase the Company for consideration per share in a range of between $45.00 to $49.00.\nOn May 7, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in\nattendance. The Board discussed with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk the details of the three first-round proposals that were received and\npotential next steps. The advisors then left the meeting and the Board went into executive session. Following additional discussion, the Board determined\nthat each of the three bidders should be requested to reconsider their proposals and provide indications of interest at an increased price.\nFollowing the May 7, 2021 Board meeting, at the direction of the Company, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed each of CNH Industrial, Bidder 1 and\nBidder 2 that such bidder was invited to submit a revised indication of interest at an increased price by May 13, 2021 and that, following the submission of\nsuch revised indication of interest, the Board would determine whether to admit such bidder into the second and final round of the bidding process.\nOn May 11, 2021, Bidder 1 submitted a revised non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for consideration per share of $54.00.\nOn May 13, 2021, CNH Industrial submitted a revised non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for consideration per share of $51.50, and Bidder 2\nsubmitted a revised non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for consideration per share in a range of between $48.00 to $52.00.\nOn May 13, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P.

Morgan sent process letters to CNH Industrial, Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 describing the requirements for\nthe second round of the bidding process. The letters instructed bidders to submit a final definitive and binding offer by June 15, 2021 specifying the bidder\u2019s\nproposed form of consideration, key conditions and assumptions, intended business and management strategy for the Company, financing sources, required\napprovals, anticipated timing and certainty of closing (including confirmation of the completion of substantive due diligence), closing conditions and\nproposed transaction structure. The letters also instructed bidders to submit a mark-up by June 8, 2021 of the bid draft merger agreement that would be\nprovided by Davis Polk.\nAlso on May 14, 2021, the three bidders received access to a virtual data room that contained detailed and confidential business, financial, operational, legal\nand other information concerning the Company. The due diligence process with each of the bidders continued through June 14, 2021. During this period,\nrepresentatives of the Company and its advisors responded to numerous diligence requests from, and conducted several diligence calls with, each of the\nbidders and their respective advisors.\n29\nTable of Contents\nBetween May 18, 2021 and May 20, 2021, members of the Company\u2019s senior management team hosted a management presentation with each of the three\nbidders in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\nOn May 19, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of J.P. Morgan shared a bid draft merger agreement with each bidder. The bid draft merger\nagreement furnished to each bidder was identical, except that with respect to CNH Industrial, the draft incorporated provisions concerning regulatory\napprovals that would apply to a non-U.S. buyer.\nOn June 8, 2021, CNH Industrial and Bidder 2 each submitted mark-ups of the merger agreement.\nOn June 9, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of J.P. Morgan shared an initial draft of the Company\u2019s disclosure schedules to the bid draft\nmerger agreement with each bidder.\nOn June 9, 2021, Bidder 1 submitted a mark-up of the merger agreement.\nOn June 10, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in\nattendance. The Board discussed with representatives of Davis Polk the terms of the bid draft merger agreement and the key issues raised in the mark-ups\nreceived from each of the bidders. In particular, Davis Polk reviewed with the Board each bidder\u2019s proposed revisions to the regulatory efforts covenant and\nregulatory termination fee. All three bidders proposed limiting the buyer\u2019s obligation under the regulatory efforts covenant to \u201creasonable best efforts\u201d with\nan additional proviso (i) in the case of CNH Industrial, that the buyer was under no obligation to (a) divest any material portion of the assets of the Applied\nTechnology operating segment of the Company (the \u201cApplied Technology Division\u201d) or agree to any restrictions on the business operations of the buyer\nwith respect to the Applied Technology Division in any material respect or (b) take any action that would have a material adverse effect on CNH Industrial\nand its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measured on a scale relative to Raven and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), and (ii) in the case of each of Bidder 1 and\nBidder 2, that the buyer was under no obligation to (a) agree to any divestiture or restrictions on business operations or (b) contest any proceeding relating\nto the proposed transaction. Coupled with these proposed revisions to the regulatory efforts covenant, CNH Industrial proposed a 5% regulatory termination\nfee, Bidder 1 did not make a proposal regarding the size of the regulatory termination fee, and Bidder 2 proposed a 3% regulatory termination fee. Following\ndiscussion of these and other terms in the bidders\u2019 mark-ups, the Board determined that the Company should provide feedback to each of the bidders with\nrespect to the key issues raised in such bidder\u2019s mark-up and invite each bidder to submit a revised mark-up with its final bid.\nOn June 11, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of Davis Polk held teleconference calls with the legal advisors of CNH Industrial and Bidder\n1 to communicate the Company\u2019s feedback on key issues raised in each bidder\u2019s mark-up. Davis Polk also contacted the legal advisor of Bidder 2 to schedule\na teleconference call to discuss the key issues raised in Bidder 2\u2019s mark-up. Bidder 2\u2019s legal advisor indicated to Davis Polk that the legal advisor would need\nto consult with Bidder 2 prior to scheduling a call, but there was no further contact between the legal advisors following that communication.\nOn June 14, 2021, Bidder 2 communicated to the Company that it would not be submitting a final offer.\nOn June 15, 2021, CNH Industrial submitted a final offer to acquire the Company for $58.00 per share in cash. The final offer from CNH Industrial was\naccompanied by a revised mark-up of the draft merger agreement. Among other things, in the revised mark-up CNH Industrial (i) agreed to take all actions\nrequired by a governmental entity to consummate the Merger so long as such action would not have a material adverse effect on the Applied Technology\nDivision or on CNH Industrial and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measured on a scale relative to Raven and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) and (ii)\nproposed a 6% regulatory termination fee (approximately $120 million).\nAlso on June 15, 2021, Bidder 1 submitted a final offer to acquire the Company for an implied value of $55.50 per share, with such consideration to be\ncomprised of (i) $37.00 per share in cash and (ii) a fixed number of shares of Bidder 1\u2019s common stock equivalent to $18.50 per share (based on the volume-\nweighted average price of Bidder 1\u2019s common stock, measured over the five-day trading period prior to announcement of the transaction). The final offer from\nBidder 1 was also accompanied by a revised mark-up of the draft merger agreement. Among other things, the revised mark-up (i) did not reflect any changes\nto the regulatory efforts covenant proposed in Bidder 1\u2019s initial mark-up but indicated in a footnote that Bidder 1 would be open to removing the proviso that\nthe buyer is under no obligation to contest any proceedings relating to the proposed transaction if the Company agreed to extend the outside date until any\nsuch litigation is resolved and (ii) proposed a $100 million regulatory termination fee.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOn June 15, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in\nattendance. The Board discussed with the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk the details of the two final offer packages that were received and\npotential next steps. Following discussion, the Board authorized the Company to continue discussions with each of CNH Industrial and Bidder 1.\nOn June 16, 2021, at the direction of the Company, Davis Polk sent Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, legal counsel to CNH Industrial, a mark-up of the draft merger\nagreement that was submitted with CNH Industrial\u2019s final bid. From June 16, 2021 until the execution of the Merger Agreement on June 20, 2021, the parties\nand their respective legal advisors exchanged several drafts of, and engaged in numerous discussions and negotiations concerning the terms of, the Merger\nAgreement and the Company\u2019s disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement. Primary areas of discussion and negotiation included the scope of CNH\nIndustrial\u2019s undertaking to obtain required regulatory approvals, the \u201cno-shop\u201d provisions, and various employee-related and intellectual property-related\nmatters. In connection with these negotiations, on June 17, 2021, CNH Industrial agreed to increase its regulatory termination fee to $200 million. During this\ntime, representatives of CNH Industrial and its advisors also performed additional confirmatory due diligence.\nOn June 17, 2021, at the direction of the Company, Davis Polk held a teleconference call with the legal advisors of Bidder 1 to communicate the Company\u2019s\nfeedback on key issues in the revised mark-up of the draft merger agreement that was submitted with Bidder 1\u2019s final bid. Significant areas of discussion\nincluded the scope of Bidder 1\u2019s undertaking to obtain required regulatory approvals, each party\u2019s assessment of the antitrust risk associated with a\ncombination of the parties, the size of the proposed regulatory termination fee, the requirement proposed by Bidder 1 that the Company cooperate with Bidder\n1 to facilitate the sale of certain assets or ownership interests held by the Company following the signing of a definitive merger agreement, the status of\nBidder 1\u2019s financing arrangements and Bidder 1\u2019s anticipated timing to reach a position to sign a definitive merger agreement. In connection with those\nconversations, representatives of Bidder 1\u2019s legal counsel informed representatives of Davis Polk that Bidder 1 would need approximately seven to ten days\nbefore Bidder 1 would be in a position to sign a definitive merger agreement.\nOn June 18, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in\nattendance. Representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan provided an update to the Board on their respective conversations with the legal and financial\nadvisors of CNH Industrial and Bidder 1.\nOn June 19, 2021, the Board received a letter from Bidder 1 reaffirming its interest in acquiring the Company and communicating certain changes that Bidder 1\nwas willing to make to its final offer package in an effort to address the concerns, as communicated between the parties\u2019 legal advisors, with respect to the\npotential antitrust risk associated with a combination of the Company with Bidder 1, including an increase in the regulatory termination fee proposed by\nBidder 1 from $100 million to $150 million and certain revisions to the scope of Bidder 1\u2019s undertaking to obtain required regulatory approvals. There was no\nchange in Bidder 1\u2019s previously communicated offer price of $55.50 per share. In its June 19 letter, Bidder 1 reiterated that announcement of a transaction with\nthe Company would not occur prior to one week from its June 19 letter.\nOn June 20, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in\nattendance. Prior to the meeting, the directors had received (i) a substantially final draft of the Merger Agreement negotiated with CNH Industrial, together\nwith a summary thereof prepared by Davis Polk, and (ii) a financial presentation prepared by J.P. Morgan. Representatives of Davis Polk reviewed with the\ndirectors the fiduciary duties applicable to the Board\u2019s consideration of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. The Board then discussed the June 19 letter\nreceived from Bidder 1 with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk. Following those discussions, the Board determined to proceed with a discussion\nof the CNH Industrial transaction because it had both a superior price and superior terms compared to the proposal of Bidder 1 and could be executed\nimmediately. Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed with the Board the strategic review process it had undertaken at the request of the Board and its\nfinancial analyses of the Merger Consideration in the proposed transaction with CNH Industrial. J.P. Morgan then rendered to the Board its oral opinion,\nwhich was subsequently confirmed by the delivery of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion addressed to the Board dated June 20, 2021 to the effect that, as of such\ndate, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration of\n$58.00 per share to be paid to the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nshareholders. Representatives of Davis Polk then reviewed with the directors the terms of the Merger Agreement. Based on the discussions and deliberations\nat this meeting and prior meetings, the various discussions and reviews with representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan, and various other factors,\nincluding those described in \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Raven\u2019s Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Raven Board of Directors,\u201d the Board\nunanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby were fair to, and in the best interests of,\nthe\n31\nTable of Contents\nCompany and its shareholders, (2) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and (3) recommended that the Company\u2019s shareholders\napprove the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby.\nShortly after the Board meeting on June 20, 2021, the Company, CNH Industrial and Merger Subsidiary finalized the Company\u2019s disclosure schedules to the\nMerger Agreement and entered into the Merger Agreement.\nShortly after the execution of the Merger Agreement on June 20, 2021, the Company sent a letter to Bidder 1 communicating its decision to terminate further\ndiscussions with Bidder 1.\nLater on June 20, 2021, after the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Board received a letter from Bidder 1 reaffirming its interest in acquiring the Company\nand revising the proposed purchase price from its letter on June 19, 2021 from $55.50 per share in cash and stock to $59.00 per share in cash. The letter also\nrequested exclusivity through the end of the day on June 28, 2021.\nOn June 21, 2021, the Company and CNH Industrial issued a joint press release before markets in the U.S. and Europe opened announcing their execution of\nthe Merger Agreement.\nAlso on June 21, 2021, the Company sent a letter to Bidder 1 informing Bidder 1 of the Company\u2019s entry into the Merger Agreement with CNH Industrial prior\nto its receipt of the letter from Bidder 1 on June 20, 2021.

        "Raven\u2019s Reasons for the Merger": {
            "text": "Raven\u2019s Reasons for the Merger\nAt a meeting duly called and held on June 20, 2021, the Board determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\nare fair to, and in the best interests of, Raven and its shareholders and approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Board also resolved that the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by the shareholders of Raven at\na special meeting of shareholders and to recommend that the shareholders of Raven vote to approve the Merger Agreement. The Raven Board consulted withRaven\u2019s outside financial and legal advisors and senior management at various times and considered a number of factors, including the following principal\nfactors (not in any relative order of importance) that the Board believed to support its decision:\n\u00b7\nRaven\u2019s business, current and projected financial performance and condition and future prospects in relation to the Merger Consideration of $58.00\nper share,\n\u00b7\nthe current and historical market prices of Raven common stock, including the market performance of Raven common stock relative to other\nparticipants in Raven\u2019s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Merger Consideration represented an attractive premium of\napproximately 33.6% to Raven\u2019s four-week volume-weighted average stock price,\n\u00b7\nthe fact that J.P. Morgan, at the Board\u2019s instruction, contacted six prospective buyers, that of these prospective buyers, four entered into\nconfidentiality agreements with respect to a potential transaction with the Company, two of which (including CNH Industrial) continued pursuing an\nacquisition of the Company after conducting due diligence, and that the Company did not receive a more attractive alternative bid during the sale\nprocess and prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement than the one submitted by CNH Industrial,\n\u00b7\nthe fact that Raven did not enter into any exclusivity arrangements with CNH Industrial and did not negotiate with CNH Industrial on a contractually\nexclusive basis,\n\u00b7\nthe Board\u2019s belief that its negotiations had resulted in the highest price per share for the common stock of the Company that CNH Industrial was\nwilling to pay,\n\u00b7\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the process conducted by the Company had resulted in the highest price reasonably available to the shareholders of the\nCompany,\n32\nTable of Contents\n\u00b7\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the Merger was more favorable to Raven\u2019s shareholders than the alternative of remaining a standalone independent company,\nwhich belief was based on and informed by consideration of a number of factors, risks and uncertainties, including:\no\ngeneral industry, economic and market conditions, both on a historical and on a prospective basis,\no\nthe risks and uncertainties associated with maintaining Raven\u2019s performance as a standalone company, including the risks and uncertainties\ndescribed in Raven\u2019s SEC filings, and\no\nthe uncertain returns to Raven\u2019s shareholders if Raven were to remain independent, taking into account, in particular, management\u2019s\nfinancial projections of the future financial performance and earnings of Raven, including those set forth below under \u201cThe Merger\n(Proposal 1)\u2014Certain Financial Projections\u201d and the risks involved in achieving those returns.\n\u00b7\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the risks and challenges to Raven\u2019s business described above, and in Raven\u2019s SEC filings, create substantial execution risks\nrelative to the $58.00 per share price in the Merger,\n\u00b7\nthe oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Board on June 20, 2021, which was subsequently confirmed by a written opinion, dated as of the\nsame date, addressed to the Board that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations,\nqualifications and conditions set forth in J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Raven common\nstock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders, as described further under \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014\nOpinion of Raven\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d and Annex B to this proxy statement,\n\u00b7\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, so that the transaction will allow Raven\u2019s shareholders to realize a fair value, in cash, for their\ninvestment and provides such shareholders certainty of value for their shares,\n\u00b7\nthe Board\u2019s belief that absent a superior proposal, the Merger represented a transaction that would likely be consummated based on, among other\nfactors, the limited closing conditions to the completion of the transaction, the absence of a financing condition or similar contingency that is based\non CNH Industrial\u2019s ability to obtain financing and the strong commitment made by CNH Industrial to obtain regulatory approvals, as further\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger,\u201d and\n\u00b7\nthe material terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:\no\nthe conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including the requirement that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Raven\u2019s\nshareholders,\no\nthe Board\u2019s \u201cfiduciary out\u201d with respect to third-party acquisition proposals likely to result in superior proposals, the Board\u2019s ability to\nnegotiate with another party regarding a superior proposal and, subject to paying a termination fee to CNH Industrial in the amount of $64\nmillion, accept a superior proposal,\no\nthe Board\u2019s belief that, if triggered, the termination fee payable by Raven to CNH Industrial is consistent with fees payable in comparable\ntransactions and would not be likely to preclude another party from making a competing proposal,\no\nthe fact that Raven and CNH Industrial agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger, including\npreparing and filing as promptly as practicable all necessary filings and obtaining certain specified regulatory approvals\u037e CNH Industrial\nhas further agreed to take any such actions necessary to consummate the Merger that do not constitute a materially burdensome regulatory\ncondition (as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger\u201d),\no\nthe requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain circumstances, CNH Industrial must pay\nRaven a termination fee of $200 million,\n33\nTable of Contents\no\nthe scope of the representations, warranties and covenants being made by Raven, CNH Industrial and Merger Subsidiary,\no\nthe fact that the Merger Agreement is not subject to a financing condition and, in particular, that CNH Industrial had represented in the\nMerger Agreement that it has, or will have at the Effective Time, sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately\navailable funds to consummate the Merger, and\no\nRaven\u2019s ability to specifically enforce CNH Industrial\u2019s obligation to cause the completion of the Merger to occur.\nThe Board also considered various potentially countervailing factors in its deliberations related to the Merger, including the following principal factors (not in\nany relative order of importance):\n\u00b7\nthe fact that the holders of common stock will not have an opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the combined company\nfollowing the Merger,\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that the Merger might not be completed and the effect the termination of the transaction may have on the trading price of Raven\ncommon stock, its business, operating results and prospects, which effect is likely to be exacerbated the longer the time period between the signing\nand any termination of the Merger Agreement,\n\u00b7\nthat Raven cannot solicit other acquisition proposals, and must pay CNH Industrial a termination fee in the amount of $64 million if the Merger\nAgreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if the Board changes its recommendation to Raven\u2019s shareholders to adopt the\nMerger Agreement or exercises its right to enter into a transaction that constitutes a superior proposal, which may deter others from proposing an\nalternative transaction that may be more advantageous to Raven\u2019s shareholders,\n\u00b7\nthat the restrictions imposed by the Merger Agreement on the conduct of Raven\u2019s business prior to completion of the Merger, requiring Raven to\nconduct its business only in the ordinary course and imposing additional specific restrictions, may delay, limit or prevent Raven from undertaking\nbusiness opportunities that may arise during that period,\n\u00b7\nthe possible effects of the pendency (or termination) of the Merger Agreement on Raven\u2019s business, operating results, prospects, employees,\ncustomers and suppliers,\n\u00b7\nthe fact that if the Merger is not consummated, Raven will be required to pay its own expenses associated with the Merger Agreement,\n\u00b7\nthe fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes,\n\u00b7\nthe fact that Raven is subject to various remedies available to CNH Industrial should it fail to complete the Merger or breach the Merger Agreement,\nand\n\u00b7\nthat if CNH Industrial fails to complete the Merger as a result of a breach of the Merger Agreement, depending upon the reason for not closing,\nRaven\u2019s rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce through litigation, and the success of any such action may be uncertain.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors\nconsidered by the Board. The Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor,\nsupported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information it considered.\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and\nexecutive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among\nother matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be approved by the\nshareholders of Raven. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\n34\nTable of Contents\nRecommendation of the Raven Board of Directors\nAfter careful consideration, the Board approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe Board recommends that the Raven shareholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.\nOpinion of Raven\u2019s Financial Advisor",

            "text": "Opinion of Raven\u2019s Financial Advisor\nPursuant to an engagement letter dated April 8, 2021, Raven retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger and to\ndeliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed Merger.\nAt the meeting of the Board on June 20, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the\nvarious factors, assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of\nRaven common stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan confirmed its June 20, 2021 oral opinion by\ndelivering its written opinion to the Board, dated June 20, 2021, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Raven common\nstock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated June 20, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and\nlimits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P.\nMorgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Raven\u2019s shareholders are urged to read the\nopinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its\nevaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the Merger Consideration to be paid in the proposed Merger and did not address any other aspect\nof the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of Raven or as to the underlying decision by Raven to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was approved\nby a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Raven as to how such shareholder should\nvote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u00b7\nreviewed the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u00b7\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Raven and the industries in which it operates\u037e\n\u00b7\ncompared the financial and operating performance of Raven and certain of its business segments with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of Raven common\nstock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e\n\u00b7\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of Raven relating to its business and the business\nof certain of its business segments\u037e and\n\u00b7\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the\npurposes of its opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of Raven and CNH Industrial with respect to certain aspects of the\nproposed Merger, and the past and current business operations of Raven, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of Raven, and certain\nother matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to\nor discussed with J.P. Morgan by Raven or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its\naccuracy or completeness and, pursuant to J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement letter with Raven, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such\nindependent\n35\nTable of Contents\nverification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the\nsolvency of Raven or CNH Industrial under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and\nforecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Raven to which such\nanalyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also\nassumed that the proposed Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger\nAgreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by Raven and CNH Industrial in the Merger Agreement and the related\nagreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the\nassessments made by advisors to Raven with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents\nand approvals necessary for the consummation of the proposed Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on Raven or on the contemplated\nbenefits of the proposed Merger.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P. Morgan as\nof, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not\nhave any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger\nConsideration to be paid to the holders of Raven common stock in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any\nconsideration paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Raven or as to\nthe underlying decision by Raven to engage in the proposed Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of\nany compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the MergerConsideration to be paid to the holders of Raven common stock in the proposed Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement were determined through arm\u2019s length negotiations between Raven and CNH Industrial, and the decision to enter into the\nMerger Agreement was solely that of the Board. J.P Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Board in\nits evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of Raven\u2019s Board or management with respect to the proposed\nMerger or the Merger Consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology in rendering its opinion to the\nBoard on June 20, 2021 and contained in the presentation delivered to the Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion, and this\nsummary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses\ninclude information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used\nby J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative\ndescription of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of Raven with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged\nin businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous in certain respects to Raven and/or one or more of its businesses.\nThe companies selected by J.P. Morgan (collectively, the \u201cSelected Companies\u201d) were as follows:\nApplied Technology\n\u00b7 Deere & Company\n\u00b7 Corteva, Inc.\n\u00b7 Garmin Ltd.\n\u00b7 CNH Industrial N.V.\n\u00b7 Trimble Inc.\n\u00b7 FMC Corporation\n\u00b7 AGCO Corporation\n36\nTable of Contents\nEngineered Films\n\u00b7\nAmcor plc\n\u00b7\nCelanese Corporation\n\u00b7\nBerry Global Group, Inc.\n\u00b7\nAvient Corporation\nAerostar\n\u00b7\nRaytheon Technologies Corporation\n\u00b7\nLockheed Martin Corporation\n\u00b7\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation\n\u00b7\nL3Harris Technologies, Inc.\nAutonomy\n\u00b7\nTesla, Inc.\n\u00b7\nNIO Inc.\n\u00b7\nLi Auto Inc.\n\u00b7\nXPENG Inc.\n\u00b7\nArrival Luxembourg SARL\n\u00b7\nLuminar Technologies, Inc.\n\u00b7\nNikola Corporation\n\u00b7\nVelodyne Lidar, Inc.\n\u00b7\nHyliion Holdings Corp.\nThe Selected Companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nanalysis, may be considered sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of Raven and/or one or more of its businesses. The Selected Companies may be\nconsidered similar to Raven or such businesses based on the nature of their assets and operations\u037e however, none of the companies selected is identical or\ndirectly comparable to Raven or such businesses, and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of Raven or\nsuch businesses. J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational\ncharacteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies differently than they would affect Raven or such businesses.\nUsing information obtained from the Selected Companies\u2019 public filings and FactSet Research Systems as of June 18, 2021, J.P. Morgan calculated for each\nSelected Company the ratio of such company\u2019s firm value (calculated as the market value of the company\u2019s common stock on a fully diluted basis, plus any\ndebt, debt-like items and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents) to the equity research analyst estimate for such company\u2019s (i) earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as EBITDA, or (ii) in the case of the Autonomy business, revenue, for 2023, calendarized\nbased on Raven\u2019s January 31 fiscal year end, which we refer to as FV/ 2023E EBITDA.\nBased on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its experience and judgment, J.P. Morgan selected\na multiple reference range for Raven of 11.5x to 22.5x for FV/ 2023E EBITDA.\nAfter applying this range to Raven\u2019s estimated EBITDA for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 based on the projections furnished to J.P. Morgan by\nRaven\u2019s management, as more fully described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Projected Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 41 of\nthis Proxy Statement (the \u201cProjections\u201d), the analysis indicated the following implied per share equity value ranges for Raven common stock, rounded to the\nnearest $0.25:\n37\nTable of Contents\nImplied Per Share\nEquity Value\n(rounded to the\nnearest $0.25)\nLow\nHigh\nFV/2023E EBITDA \n$\n25.25\n$\n49.00\nThe ranges of implied per share equity value were compared to (i) the closing price of Raven common stock on June 18, 2021 of $38.62, and (ii) the Merger\nConsideration of $58.00 per share of Raven common stock.\nPublic Trading Multiples Sum-of-the-Parts Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan also conducted a sum-of-the-parts analysis of Raven, based on the Projections for each of Raven\u2019s businesses identified above and for its\ncorporate services unit. Using the same information and calculations described above under \u201cPublic Trading Multiples Analysis\u201d, J.P. Morgan calculated\nranges of implied values for each of the businesses by applying illustrative multiple ranges of FV/2023E EBITDA derived for each business to the following\nmetrics for each business, respectively, in each case based on the Projections for the relevant metric for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023:\n\u00b7\nestimated EBITDA for Applied Technology,\n\u00b7\nestimated EBITDA for Engineered Films,\n\u00b7\nestimated EBITDA for Aerostar,\n\u00b7\nestimated revenue for Autonomy, and\n\u00b7\nestimated EBITDA for Corporate Services.\nJ.P. Morgan then (i) aggregated the ranges of implied values for Raven (excluding its Autonomy business) and for Raven\u2019s Autonomy business to derive an\nimplied total firm value range, (ii) subtracted net debt to arrive at an implied total equity value range and (iii) divided the implied total equity value range by\nthe number of fully diluted shares outstanding as provided by Raven management to arrive at an implied share price range. The analysis indicated the\nfollowing range of implied equity value per share for Raven common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25):\nImplied Per Share\nEquity Value\n(rounded to the\nnearest $0.25)\nLow\nHigh\n2023E FV/EBITDA \n$\n29.25\n$\n47.00\nThe ranges of implied per share equity value were compared to (i) the closing price of Raven common stock on June 18, 2021 of $38.62, and (ii) the Merger\nConsideration of $58.00 per share of Raven common stock.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied equity value per share of Raven common stock. A\ndiscounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future cash flows generated by the asset and taking into\nconsideration the time value of money with respect to those cash flows by calculating the current value of the cash flows generated by the asset, which we\nrefer to as the present value and which is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-\neconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital and other appropriate factors. The present value of all future cash flows\ngenerated by the asset for periods beyond the projections period is referred to as terminal value.\nJ.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that Raven, excluding Raven\u2019s Autonomy business, is expected to generate from April 30, 2021 through\nJanuary 31, 2031, using the Projections. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for Raven (excluding Autonomy) by applying a range of\nterminal growth rates, as provided by Raven management, ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% to the unlevered free cash flows. The unlevered free cash flows and the\nrange of terminal values were then discounted to present values as of April 30, 2021 using a range of discount rates from 9.25% to\n38\nTable of Contents\n10.25%, which range was chosen by J.P. Morgan based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Raven. J.P. Morgan then aggregated the\nrange of present values derived above to derive a range of illustrative enterprise values for Raven (excluding Autonomy).\nIn addition, using the Projections, J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that Raven\u2019s Autonomy business is expected to generate from April\n30, 2021 through January 31, 2031. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for Raven\u2019s Autonomy business by applying a range of terminal\ngrowth rates, as provided by Raven management, ranging from 2.5% to 3.5% to the unlevered free cash flows. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of\nterminal values were then discounted to present values as of April 30, 2021 using a range of discount rates ranging from 16.00% to 17.00%, which range was\nchosen by J.P. Morgan based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital for Raven\u2019s Autonomy business. J.P. Morgan then aggregated the range\nof present values derived above to derive a range of illustrative enterprise values for Raven\u2019s Autonomy business.\nJ.P. Morgan then (i) added the range of illustrative enterprise values for Raven businesses to derive a range of illustrative aggregate enterprise values for\nRaven, (ii) subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values the amount of Raven\u2019s net debt as of April 30, 2021 as provided by Raven management\nto derive a range of illustrative equity values for Raven, and (iii) divided the illustrative aggregate equity value range by the number of fully diluted shares\noutstanding as provided by Raven management to arrive at an implied share price range. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share\nequity value reference range for Raven common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, which was compared to (i) the closing price of Raven common stock on\nJune 18, 2021 of $38.62 and (ii) the Merger Consideration of $58.00 per share of Raven common stock.\nImplied Per Share\nEquity Value\n(rounded to the\nnearest $0.25)\nLow\nHigh\n$\n47.50\n$\n60.75\nDiscounted Cash Flow Sum-of-the-Parts Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan performed a discounted cash flow sum-of-the-parts analysis of Raven to calculate the present value of the standalone unlevered free cash flows\nthat each of Raven\u2019s businesses identified above under \u201c\u2014Public Trading Multiples Analysis\u201d and its corporate services unit were forecasted to generate\nfrom April 30, 2021 through January 31, 2031 based on the Projections. J.P. Morgan also calculated terminal values for each Raven business by applying a\nrange of terminal growth rates, as provided by Raven management, ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% for each business (other than Autonomy) and 2.5% to 3.5% for\nRaven\u2019s Autonomy business. The unlevered free cash flows and terminal values for each business were discounted to present value as of April 30, 2021. J.P.\nMorgan then (i) aggregated the ranges of implied values for each business to derive an implied total firm value range, (ii) subtracted net debt to arrive at an\nimplied total equity value range and (iii) divided the implied total equity value range by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding as provided by Raven\nmanagement to arrive at an implied share price range. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for\nRaven common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, which was compared to (i) the closing price of Raven common stock on June 18, 2021 of $38.62 and (ii) the\nMerger Consideration of $58.00 per share of Raven common stock:\nImplied Per Share\nEquity Value\n(rounded to the\nnearest $0.25)\nLow\nHigh\n$\n52.00\n$\n68.50\n39\nTable of Contents\nOther Information\nHistorical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed the historical prices of Raven common\nstock during the 52-week period ending on June 18, 2021, and noted that such prices ranged from $19.84 to $47.43 per share, and compared that to (i) the\nclosing price of Raven common stock on June 18, 2021 of $38.62 and (ii) the Merger Consideration of $58.00 per share of Raven common stock.\nAnalyst Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed certain publicly available equity research\nanalyst share price targets for Raven common stock obtained from FactSet Research Systems, and noted that these share price targets ranged from $47.00 to\n$55.00 per share, and compared that to (i) the closing price of Raven common stock on June 18, 2021 of $38.62 and (ii) the Merger Consideration of $58.00 per\nshare of Raven common stock.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan.\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes\nthat the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses,\nwithout considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the\nranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of Raven. The order of analyses described does\nnot represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular\nweight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative),\nconsidered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in\ndetermining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties\nand their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the Selected Companies reviewed as described in the above\nsummary is identical to Raven. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses\nthat, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to those of Raven. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and\njudgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies\ncompared to Raven.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in\nconnection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and\nunlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise Raven with respect to the\nMerger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with\nRaven and the industries in which it operates.\nFor services rendered in connection with the Merger, Raven has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a transaction fee that is estimated, based on information available\nas of the date of announcement, to be approximately $28,000,000, $3,000,000 of which became payable following delivery of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and the\nremainder of which is contingent and payable upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Raven has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses\nincurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out\nof J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement.\nDuring the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had, and continue to have, commercial or investment\nbanking relationships with Raven and CNH Industrial, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received, or will receive, customary compensation. Such\nservices during such period for Raven have included acting as its financial advisor in connection with its strategic planning in February 2021, and such\nservices during such period for CNH Industrial have included acting as joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities by CNH Industrial Capital LLC,\na subsidiary of CNH Industrial, in June 2020. Neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other material financial advisory or other material commercial\nor investment banking relationships with Exor N.V. (\u201cExor\u201d),\n40\nTable of Contents\nwhich holds approximately 26.9% of the shares and 42.5% of the voting rights in CNH Industrial, during the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nopinion. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of Raven, CNH\nIndustrial and Exor. During the two-year period preceding delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Raven were\napproximately $50,000 and from CNH Industrial were approximately $1,000,000, and no fees were recognized from Exor during such period. In the ordinary\ncourse of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank\nloans or other obligations) of Raven, CNH Industrial or Exor for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers, and, accordingly, they may at any time\nhold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.\nProjected Financial Information",

            "text": "Projected Financial Information\nRaven does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance or earnings beyond the current fiscal year and is especially wary of\nmaking projections for extended earnings periods due to, among other reasons, the unpredictability and uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and\nestimates. However, Raven prepared financial projections in May 2021 (the \u201cProjections\u201d), which were prepared as part of the strategic review process and\nprovided to CNH Industrial, Bidder 1 and Bidder 2. In addition, the Projections were provided to the Board and to J.P. Morgan for use by J.P. Morgan in its\nfinancial analyses as described further under \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Opinion of Raven\u2019s Financial Advisor.\u201d\nWe have included a summary of certain of the Projections below to give shareholders access to certain nonpublic information provided to the Board for\npurposes of considering and evaluating Raven\u2019s strategic and financial alternatives, including the Merger, and to J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial\nanalyses. The inclusion of the Projections should not be regarded as an indication that CNH Industrial, Raven or the Board, J.P. Morgan, any of their\nrespective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an\nassurance of the achievement of future results.\nThe Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure. The financial projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are\nthe responsibility of, Raven\u2019s management. The financial projections were prepared solely for internal use of Raven and are subjective in many respects.\nProjecting future performance is difficult, and given the extended timeline of the Projections, as well as the risks and uncertainties inherent in the market\nacceptance of and timing for advanced autonomous solutions, there is an increased level of unpredictability in the Projections. Although a summary of the\nfinancial projections is presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by our management\nthat our management believed were reasonable at the time the financial projections were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to\nmanagement at the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. In\naddition, the financial projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give\neffect to the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the financial projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse\nthan those contained in the financial projections. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, Raven, J.P. Morgan\nor any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the forecasts to be predictive of actual future results.\nThe Projections are unaudited and were not prepared with a view toward compliance with the guidelines established by the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information or generally accepted accounting principles as applied\nin the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d) or the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Neither the Company\u2019s\nindependent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountant has compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to\nthe financial projections or expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on the financial projections or their achievability. The Company\u2019sindependent registered public accounting firm assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association with, the financial projections.\nThe Projections are forward-looking statements.

            "text": "Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board to approve the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that Raven\u2019s directors and executive officers have\ncertain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Raven\u2019s shareholders generally. The Board was aware of and\nconsidered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger\nAgreement be approved by the shareholders of Raven. These interests are described and quantified below.\nEquity-Based Awards\nRaven\u2019s executive officers currently hold vested and unvested Raven Stock Options and Raven RSUs, while Raven\u2019s directors hold Raven DSUs.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding equity awards of Raven (including awards held by\nRaven\u2019s executive officers and directors) will be treated as follows:\n\u00b7\nEach Raven RSU that is outstanding under any Raven Stock Plan, whether vested or not vested, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right\nto receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Raven common stock represented by the\nRaven RSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven RSU will automatically vest and be paid or distributed to the holder of\nsuch Raven RSU. To the extent the number of shares of Raven common stock underlying a Raven RSU is based on the satisfaction of performance\nconditions, such performance conditions will be deemed to have been earned at the greater of (i) the target amount under the terms of the applicable\naward agreement and (ii) the amount based on the actual performance level achieved under such award agreement based on performance through the\nEffective Time, such performance to be determined by Raven\u2019s reasonable determination of performance as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nAny payment in respect of Raven RSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject\nto Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid without triggering a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code will be made at the\nearliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of\nearliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of\nthe Code.\n\u00b7\nEach Raven DSU that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether vested or not vested, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right to\nreceive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Raven common stock represented by the Raven\nDSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven DSU will automatically vest and be paid or distributed to the holder of such\nRaven DSU.

Any Raven Stock Option\nfor which the exercise price is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled without any consideration.\nSee \u201cInterests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement for\nan estimate of the amounts that would become payable to each named executive officer of Raven in respect of his or her unvested Raven Stock Options and\nRaven RSUs.\nChange in Control Agreements\nOn June 20, 2021, the Personnel & Compensation Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) of the Board approved the entry by Raven into Amended and Restated\nChange in Control Agreements (collectively, the \u201cAmended Change in Control Agreements\u201d) with certain executives of Raven, including Daniel A. Ryhkus,\nTaimur Sharih, Steven Brazones, Scott Wickersham, Lee Magnuson, Anthony Schmidt and Nicole Freesemann (together, the \u201cCiC Participants\u201d). The\nAmended Change in Control Agreements for the CiC Participants provide that in the event of a termination of the CiC Participant\u2019s employment by Raven\nwithout Cause or by the CiC Participant due to a Constructive Termination (as such terms are defined in the Amended Change in Control Agreements) within\ntwo years following a change of control (which will include the Merger), the CiC Participant will be entitled to the following severance benefits: (i) the product\nof (x) the sum of (A) the CiC Participant\u2019s annual base salary in effect as of the CiC Participant\u2019s termination and (B) the CiC Participant\u2019s target bonus amount\nunder Raven\u2019s short-term incentive plan (the \u201cSTIP\u201d) for the year of termination, and (y) a multiple, with such multiple being equal to three for Mr. Rykhus,\ntwo for Mr. Brazones and Mr. Sharih, and one-and-one-half for Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Wickersham, Mr. Magnuson and Ms. Freesemann\u037e (ii) a prorated bonus\nunder the STIP based on the greater of (A) the applicable target bonus amount and (B) the reasonably anticipated achievement of the applicable performance\nmetrics for the entire fiscal year in which the termination occurs\u037e provided, however, that such bonus will not be duplicative of any bonus to which such CiC\nParticipant is entitled under the Merger Agreement for such fiscal year\u037e (iii) reimbursement of the employer portion of the CiC Participant\u2019s COBRA premiums\nfor up to eighteen months following the CiC Participant\u2019s termination\u037e and (iv) the accelerated vesting of any performance-based stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) in an\namount equal to the greater of (A) the target amount of such PSUs and (B) an amount based on actual performance through the change in control. In\naddition, Mr. Schmidt will vest in his post-retirement benefits upon such a termination of his employment (Mr. Rykhus has already met the requirements for\nretirement eligibility and his benefits are fully vested).\nIn connection with Raven\u2019s entry into the Amended Change in Control Agreements, Raven also entered into amended and restated employment agreements\nwith Mr. Rykhus and Mr. Brazones (collectively, the \u201cAmended Employment Agreements\u201d). Under the Amended Employment Agreements, the severance\nbenefits provided to Mr. Rykhus and Mr. Brazones upon or following a change in control were removed in recognition of Raven\u2019s entry into AmendedChange in Control Agreements with Mr. Rykhus and Mr. Brazones. The Amended Employment Agreements amend and restate in their entirety each of Mr.\nRykhus\u2019s and Mr. Brazones\u2019s existing employment agreements with Raven.\nRetention Program\nIn connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Committee also approved the adoption of a retention program under which Raven may pay cash-\nbased retention bonuses (the \u201cRetention Bonuses\u201d) to up to 183 employees of Raven in an aggregate amount of up to $10.3 million (the \u201cRetention\nProgram\u201d). Retention Bonuses under the Retention Program will include potential payments of $1,230,000 to Mr. Rykhus, $390,000 to Mr. Sharih, $597,000 to\nMr. Brazones, $180,000 to Mr. Schmidt, $345,000 to Mr. Wickersham, $338,000 to Mr. Magnuson and $382,500 to Ms. Freesemann. Subject to their continued\nemployment through the applicable vesting date, up to 50% of each participant\u2019s award under the Retention Program will vest and be payable within 60 days\nfollowing the closing of the Merger and at least 50% of such participant\u2019s award under the Retention Program will vest and be payable six months following\nthe closing of the Merger (or three months in the case of Mr. Rykhus), subject, in each case, to earlier vesting and payment upon a termination of the\nparticipant\u2019s employment by Raven without Cause or by the participant due to a Constructive Termination (as such terms are defined in the individual award\nagreements under the Retention Program).\n43\nTable of Contents\nSee \u201cInterests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement for\nthe estimated amounts that each of Raven\u2019s named executive officers would receive under his or her Amended Change in Control Agreement and the\nRetention Program upon a qualifying termination of employment.\nAnnual Bonuses\nIf the closing of the Merger occurs before the date annual bonuses for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022 (or, if applicable, January 31, 2023) are paid\nunder any Raven annual cash incentive compensation plan or arrangement (each, a \u201cClosing Year Bonus Plan\u201d), the bonus amount required to be paid to\nparticipating Raven employees under the applicable Closing Year Bonus Plan will be the greater of (A) such participant\u2019s target bonus amount under the\nClosing Year Bonus Plan in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) such participant\u2019s bonus amount under the Closing Year Bonus Plan\nbased on Raven\u2019s reasonably anticipated achievement of the applicable performance metrics for the entire fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs\u037e\nprovided, however, that any bonus amount payable under a Closing Year Bonus Plan for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 will be prorated based on the\nnumber of days in such fiscal year prior to the closing date, and CNH Industrial will provide participating Raven employees with an additional annual bonus\nopportunity for the remainder of such fiscal year in a manner consistent with the Merger Agreement. The determination of the anticipated achievement of the\napplicable performance metrics will be based on Raven\u2019s reasonable determination of such achievement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Annual\nbonuses under each Closing Year Bonus Plan will be paid within thirty (30) days after the closing date.\nCompensation Payable to Raven\u2019s Directors and Non-NEO Executive Officers\nThe estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable to Raven\u2019s non-management directors in respect of their Raven DSUs are set forth in the table\nbelow.

Raven\u2019s shareholders are being asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,\nsuch compensation for the NEO\u2019s (see the section entitled \u201cAdvisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Arrangements\n(Proposal 2)\u201d beginning on page 73 of this proxy statement). Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on either\nRaven or CNH Industrial. Accordingly, if the Merger is approved by Raven\u2019s shareholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation for the NEOs will\nbe payable regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions applicable to the vote to approve\nthe Merger, which are described in the footnotes to the table and above under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Interests of Raven Directors\nand Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement.\n44\nTable of Contents\nThe estimates in the table assume that the Merger will become effective on December 1, 2021 and that, immediately after the consummation of the Merger,\neach NEO\u2019s employment will be terminated by Raven without Cause or by the NEO due to a Constructive Termination (as such terms are defined in the\nAmended Change in Control Agreements or in the NEO\u2019s individual award agreement under the Retention Program, as applicable). See the footnotes to the\ntable for additional assumptions.\nBrian E.

The actual amounts\npayable following a termination of employment would depend on the date of termination, the manner of termination and the terms of the agreements in effect\nat such time.\n\u00b7\nIt is assumed that the Merger will be consummated on December 1, 2021.\n\u00b7\nEach NEO is assumed to experience a termination without Cause or for Constructive Termination (if applicable under the terms of the\napplicable Amended Change in Control Agreement) immediately following the consummation of the Merger.\n\u00b7\nCompensation levels on the date of termination are assumed to be the same as those as of the date of this proxy statement.\n(b) Amounts are equal to a multiple of each NEO\u2019s base salary and target bonus, which is calculated as follows: (i) the product of (x) the sum of (A) the NEO\u2019s\nannual base salary in effect as of the NEO\u2019s termination and (B) the NEO\u2019s target bonus amount under the STIP for the year of termination, and (y) a multiple,\nwith such multiple being equal to three for Mr. Rykhus, two for Mr. Brazones and Mr. Sharih, and one-and-one-half for Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Wickersham and Mr.\nMagnuson.\n46\nTable of Contents\n(c) This represents the target bonus amount under the STIP. The ultimate amount to be received by the NEO pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement\nwill be based on the greater of (A) the applicable target bonus amount and (B) the reasonably anticipated achievement of the applicable performance metrics\nfor the entire fiscal year in which the termination occurs. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Employee Matters\u201d for a description of the\ntreatment of the bonuses under the STIP under the terms of the Merger Agreement.\n(d) Up to 50% of the Retention Bonuses under the Retention Program will vest and be payable within 60 days following the closing of the Merger and at least\n50% of the Retention Bonuses will vest and be payable six months following the closing of the Merger (or three months in the case of Mr. Rykhus), subject, in\neach case, to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. In addition, any unpaid portion of the Retention Bonuses will vest and become\npayable upon a termination of the NEO\u2019s employment by Raven without Cause or by the NEO due to a Constructive Termination (as such terms are defined in\nthe individual award agreements under the Retention Program).\n(2) The following table provides additional information regarding the equity award holdings of each NEO that will be canceled and exchanged for the Merger\nConsideration (net of the applicable exercise price in the case of Raven Stock Options) on a single-trigger basis in connection with the consummation of the\nMerger. With respect to RSUs that are subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, the values of the RSUs set forth in the tables assume\nachievement of performance at target level. For Mr. Meyer, the value of his RSUs represents the target amount prorated for the period of time between the\napplicable grant date and his termination of employment.\nValue of Unvested\nStock Options\nValue of RSUs\nTotal\n($)\n($)\n($)\nNamed Executive Officers\nDaniel A.

Mr.Rykhus has met the requirements for retirement eligibility and his benefits are fully vested. As Mr. Rykhus is not entitled to any additional benefits\nthat are payable in connection with or otherwise relate to the Merger, no values are included in this column for Mr. Rykhus.\n(5) Based on the current cost of the benefit. The program provides that the retiree will pay no more than active executives for coverage.\n(6) Amounts included in this column represent the maximum aggregate annual reimbursement amount that Mr. Schmidt would receive over his lifetime,\nassuming for these purposes that Mr. Schmidt\u2019s life expectancy is that of the average male in the United States. The actual expenses submitted to the plan\neach year may be less than the maximum annual reimbursement amount.\n(7) The amounts included in these columns are double-trigger payments.\n47\nTable of Contents",

This proposal, commonly known as \u201csay-on-golden parachutes,\u201d and which we refer to\nas the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, gives Raven shareholders the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis,\non the named executive officer merger-related compensation.

This discussion applies only to holders that hold their Raven common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of\nthe Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of\nthe holder\u2019s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:\n\u00b7\nDealers or traders subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to Raven common stock\u037e\n\u00b7\nPersons holding Raven common stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion transaction, integrated transaction or constructive\nsale transaction\u037e\n\u00b7\nU.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u00b7\nPartnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e\n\u00b7\nPersons who acquired Raven common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation\u037e\n\u00b7\nCertain financial institutions and insurance companies\u037e\n\u00b7\nRegulated investment companies\u037e\n\u00b7\nReal estate investment trusts\u037e\n\u00b7\nCertain former citizens or residents of the United States\u037e\n\u00b7\nTax-exempt entities, including an \u201cindividual retirement account\u201d or \u201cRoth IRA\u037e\u201d or\n\u00b7\nPersons subject to the United States alternative minimum tax.\nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Raven common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a\npartner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Raven common stock and partners in\nsuch partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.\nThis discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final and temporary Treasury regulations, all as of the date\nhereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax considerations under state, local and foreign laws are not addressed.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Raven common stock that is:\n\u00b7\nA citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u00b7\nA corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e or\n\u00b7\nAn estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.\nThe exchange of Raven common stock for cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder\nwhose shares of Raven common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in such shares. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. Gain or loss will be determined\nseparately for each block of shares of Raven common stock (i.e., shares of Raven common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain\nor loss generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder\u2019s holding\n77\nTable of Contents\nperiod in the shares of Raven common stock exceeds one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S.\nholders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Capital gains\nrecognized by individuals, trusts and estates also may be subject to a 3.8% federal Medicare contribution tax.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nA \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of Raven common stock that is not a U.S. holder or a partnership. Payments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange\nfor shares of Raven common stock pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u00b7\nThe gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and if required by\nan applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder\u2019s permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States)\u037e\n\u00b7\nThe non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of shares of\nRaven common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger and certain other conditions are met\u037e or\n\u00b7\nThe non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of the Raven common stock at\nany time during the five-year period preceding the Merger, and Raven is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder\nheld Raven common stock.\nA non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized as if the non-U.S.\nholder were a U.S. holder. If such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively\nconnected earnings and profits (or a lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at arate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year, even\nthough the individual is not considered a resident of the United States.\nRaven believes that it is not, and has not been, a United States real property holding corporation.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made in exchange for shares of Raven common stock generally will be subject to information reporting unless the holder is an \u201cexempt recipient\u201d\nand may also be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24%. To avoid backup withholding, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption\nshould complete and return Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided\nis correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. A non-U.S. holder that provides the applicable withholding agent with an Internal\nRevenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, as appropriate, will generally establish an exemption from backup withholding.\nAmounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited against a holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax\nliability, provided the relevant information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.\nYou are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular circumstances as well as any tax\nconsequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or under the laws of any state, local or foreign tax laws.\n78\nTable of Contents\nFUTURE RAVEN SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS",
