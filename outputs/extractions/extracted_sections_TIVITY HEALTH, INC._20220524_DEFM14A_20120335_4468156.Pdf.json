            "text": "The Special Meeting (page 26)\nDate, Time and Place\nThe special meeting of Tivity Health stockholders (the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d) will be held at Tivity Health\u2019s corporate\nheadquarters, located at 701 Cool Springs Blvd., Franklin, Tennessee, 37067, on June 23, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Central\nTime, unless the meeting is adjourned or postponed.\nRecord Date\u037e Shares Entitled to Vote\nYou are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of\nTivity Health (\u201cTivity Health Common Stock\u201d), at the close of business on May 23, 2022, the record date for the\nSpecial Meeting (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d). You will have one vote at the Special Meeting for each share of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock you owned at the close of business on the Record Date.\nPurpose\nAt the Special Meeting, we will ask Tivity Health stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on proposals\n(i) to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may\nbecome payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and (iii) to approve\none or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit\nadditional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement\nor to seek a quorum if one is not initially obtained (collectively, the \u201cSpecial Meeting Proposals\u201d).\nQuorum\nThe holders of a majority of voting power of all issued and outstanding Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote\nat the Special Meeting, present or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the\nSpecial Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 49,932,432 shares of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. 24,966,217 shares must be present or represented by\nproxy at the Special Meeting to have a quorum.\nRequired Vote\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is\nrequired to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the\nTivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at the Special\nMeeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve (i) by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the\nproposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers\nin connection with the Merger and (ii) the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of\n1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are\ninsufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is\nnot initially obtained. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be approved if the number of\nshares voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal is greater than 50% of the total number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock\nentitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity\nHealth to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and the proposal to approve the adjournment\nfrom time to time of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate. Because all three proposals presented to\nstockholders will be considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.\nBroker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as\nvotes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.\nShare Ownership of Tivity Health\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\nAs of May 23, 2022, the Record Date, Tivity Health\u2019s directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were\nentitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,325,979 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, representing approximately 2.66%\nof the outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock.

See \u201cHow are my shares in Tivity Health\u2019s 401(k)\nPlan voted?\u201d in the Questions and Answers section of the Proxy Statement for more information.\nIf your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are held in a street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or\nother nominee how to vote your shares, then, because the Special Meeting Proposals are \u201cnon-routine matters,\u201d your\nbroker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special Meeting\nProposals. If your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank or other nominee\nhas enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement.

Specifically, the Complaints allege that the preliminary\nproxy statement filed by Tivity Health with the SEC on May 10, 2022 in connection with the Merger contains\nmaterially incomplete and misleading information concerning the Company\u2019s financial projections and the financial\nanalyses conducted by Lazard in support of its fairness opinion.

The\noutcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or delay\nconsummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Tivity Health, including any costs associated with the\nindemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no order,\njudgment, or injunction, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, by any court or other tribunal of competent\njurisdiction has been entered and continues to be in effect, and no law has been adopted or is effective, in each case\nthat restrains, enjoins, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff\nwere successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms,\nthen such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated within the expected time frame, or at all.\nRestrictions on Solicitations of Other Offers (page 75)",

            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nThe following questions and answers are intended to address some commonly asked questions regarding the\nMerger, the Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions\nthat may be important to you as a Tivity Health stockholder. You are encouraged to read carefully the more detailed\ninformation contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, the annexes to this Proxy Statement and the documents we\nrefer to in this Proxy Statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement\nwithout charge by following the instructions in the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d\nbeginning on page 101 of this Proxy Statement.\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\nA:\nOn April 5, 2022, Tivity Health entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub with\nand into Tivity Health, with Tivity Health surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, an\naffiliate of Stone Point Capital. The Board is furnishing this Proxy Statement and form of proxy card to the\nholders of Tivity Health Common Stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement and to approve the other proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting or any\nadjournment or postponement thereof. This Proxy Statement includes information that we are required to\nprovide to you under the SEC rules and is designed to assist you in voting on the matters presented at the\nSpecial Meeting. Tivity Health stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 23, 2022 may attend\nthe Special Meeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the Special Meeting Proposals.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Special Meeting will be held at Tivity Health\u2019s headquarters located at 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin,\nTennessee, 37067, on June 23, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Central Time.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Tivity Health?\nA:\nThe proposed Merger is the acquisition of Tivity Health by Parent through the merger of Merger Sub with and\ninto Tivity Health pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is\napproved by the requisite number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, and the other closing conditions\nunder the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Tivity Health,\nwith Tivity Health continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Tivity Health will become\na direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and you will no longer own shares of Tivity Health Common Stock.\nTivity Health expects to delist its common stock from Nasdaq and de-register its common stock under the\nExchange Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Thereafter, Tivity Health would no longer be a\npublicly traded company, and Tivity Health will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Tivity\nHealth Common Stock.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is consummated?\nA:\nUpon the consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 in\ncash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Tivity Health Common Stock\nthat you own, unless you have properly exercised and perfected your demand for appraisal rights under the\nDGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, you will\nbe entitled to receive $3,250.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, in exchange\nfor your 100 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock. In either case, your shares will be canceled and you will not\nown nor be entitled to acquire shares in the Surviving Corporation or Parent.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nOnly stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 23, 2022 are entitled to notice of the Special\nMeeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. If your shares of\nTivity Health Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other\n15TABLE OF CONTENTS\nnominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are \u201cnon-routine\nmatters,\u201d your broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the\nSpecial Meeting Proposals.

You may also be required to\npost a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not consummated?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Tivity Health stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for\nany other reason, Tivity Health stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock. Instead, Tivity Health will remain an independent public company, Tivity Health Common Stock\nwill continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to\nfile periodic reports with the SEC on account of Tivity Health Common Stock.\nUnder certain specified circumstances in which the Merger is not consummated, Tivity Health may be required\nto pay Parent a termination fee, or under certain other specified circumstances, Tivity Health may be entitled to\nreceive a reverse termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the\nsections entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fees\u201d beginning on page 88 of this Proxy\nStatement.\nQ:\nDo any of Tivity Health\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ\nfrom those of Tivity Health stockholders generally?\nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, you should be aware that Tivity Health\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the\nMerger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Tivity Health stockholders generally. The Board was\naware of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in\nevaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and the\nMerger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Tivity Health stockholders. For a\ndescription of the interests of Tivity Health\u2019s directors and executive officers in the Merger, see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger\u201d beginning\non page 56 of this Proxy Statement.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain\ncompensation arrangements for Tivity Health\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nUnder SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that\nmay be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nMerger, commonly referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote\nthereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting\npower of the Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at\nthe Special Meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve: (i) by means of a non-binding,\nadvisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its\nnamed executive officers in connection with the Merger, and (ii) the proposal to approve one or more\nadjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate. This means that the proposal\nto adopt the Merger Agreement will be approved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal is greater\nthan 50% of the total number of outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote at the\nSpecial Meeting. The failure of any stockholder of record to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by\ntelephone, submit a signed proxy card, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not have any effect on the proposal to\napprove compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger or the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from\ntime to time, if necessary or appropriate. Abstentions will be counted as votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity\nHealth to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and the proposal to approve one or more\nadjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate. Because all of the proposals\npresented to stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the\nSpecial Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and\nwill not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs of May 23, 2022, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there were\napproximately 49,932,432 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock issued and outstanding.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of its ongoing oversight and evaluation of Tivity Health\u2019s business, the Board, together with senior\nmanagement, regularly reviews and assesses opportunities to increase stockholder value, including evaluating\nvarious potential strategic alternatives, including acquisitions, dispositions and internal restructurings. In recent\nyears, Tivity Health has undergone significant leadership changes among the Board, beginning with the addition of\nAnthony Sanfilippo and Erin Russell as new independent directors in March 2020 and the subsequent appointment\nof Mr. Sanfilippo as independent Chairman in April 2020. These changes at the Board level were accompanied by\nchanges among the senior management team, including the hiring of Richard Ashworth as President and Chief\nExecutive Officer in June 2020. The refreshed Board and management team have led a successful reorientation of\nTivity Health\u2019s strategy, which has included the disposition in December 2020 of Tivity Health\u2019s Nutrition business\nacquired via the acquisition of Nutrisystem, Inc. in March 2019, refocusing Tivity Health\u2019s strategy on strengthening\nand expanding its core SilverSneakers, Prime Fitness and Whole Health Living brands, and the successful navigation\nof the pandemic leading to both recovery of in-person fitness visits to Tivity Health\u2019s gym partners and ongoing\nexpansion of virtual fitness offerings. These efforts were recognized by the capital markets, leading to a recovery in\nTivity Health\u2019s stock price from a closing price of $5.27 on April 1, 2020, the day before Mr. Sanfilippo was appointed\nChairman, to $25.36 on December 7, 2021, the day before Stone Point Capital provided its initial written indication of\ninterest in acquiring Tivity Health.\nOn October 14, 2021, Mr. Ashworth received a telephone call from a representative of a significant stockholder of\nTivity Health (\u201cStockholder A\u201d) related to contacts such representative had had with Stone Point Capital, an\ninvestment firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The representative of Stockholder A relayed that Stone Point\nCapital had been a long-term follower of Tivity Health\u2019s business and may have interest in exploring a potential\nstrategic transaction. Mr. Ashworth responded that the Board and Tivity Health were always receptive to stockholder\nfeedback and to exploring opportunities to create additional value for stockholders, and confirmed to the\nrepresentative of Stockholder A that he would be open to connecting with representatives of Stone Point Capital.\nThe representative of Stockholder A followed up later that day with an email introduction connecting Mr. Ashworth\nwith the Stone Point Capital representatives.\nOn October 28, 2021, Mr. Ashworth and Adam Holland, Chief Financial Officer of Tivity Health, held an initial\ntelephonic meeting with representatives of Stone Point Capital to discuss publicly available information relating to\nTivity Health\u2019s business and operations, financial performance and strategic direction, and at the end of the\ndiscussion Stone Point Capital expressed interest in exploring a possible strategic transaction between Stone Point\nCapital and Tivity Health, including a possible acquisition of Tivity Health by Stone Point Capital. On November 3,\n2021, representatives of Stone Point Capital emailed Mr. Ashworth noting their positive view of the October 28\nmeeting and ongoing interest in maintaining an open dialogue. Subsequent to these interactions, Mr. Ashworth met\nwith Mr. Sanfilippo, Tivity Health\u2019s independent Chairman, to recount the discussions, and Mr. Sanfilippo directed\nMr. Ashworth to maintain the dialogue with Stone Point Capital and report any material developments to the Board.\nOn November 16, 2021, at Stone Point Capital\u2019s request, Mr. Ashworth conducted a follow-up call with\nrepresentatives of Stone Point Capital and addressed additional questions about Tivity Health\u2019s business, customer\nbase and strategy. On November 18, 2021, a call to discuss further follow-up questions about Tivity Health\u2019s\nbusiness, customer base and strategy was conducted by Mr. Ashworth and Mr. Holland with representatives of\nStone Point Capital and on November 23, 2021, a similar call was conducted with Stone Point Capital by Messrs.\nAshworth and Holland, along with Jeremy Kunicki, Tivity Health\u2019s Senior Vice President of Corporate Development,\nand Chris Morrison, Tivity Health\u2019s Senior Vice President of Strategic Management. In each of these meetings,\ninformation provided by representatives of Tivity Health was limited to publicly available information.\n33TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 29, 2021, Messrs. Ashworth, Holland, Kunicki and Morrison met with representatives of Stone Point\nCapital in Nashville, Tennessee over dinner for further discussions of publicly available information about Tivity\nHealth\u2019s business and strategy, as well as possible business opportunities with Stone Point Capital\u2019s portfolio\ncompanies. On December 1, 2021, representatives of Stone Point Capital contacted Mr. Ashworth by telephone to\nnote their positive view of the November 29 discussion and to request a group call that would include\nrepresentatives of certain of Stone Point Capital\u2019s portfolio companies. On December 3, 2021, Messrs. Ashworth and\nHolland held a call with representatives of Stone Point Capital and one of Stone Point Capital\u2019s portfolio companies\nto discuss publicly available information about Tivity Health and potential strategic opportunities. Subsequent to\nthese interactions, Mr. Ashworth spoke with Mr. Sanfilippo by telephone to recount the discussions, and Mr.\nSanfilippo directed Mr. Ashworth to continue the dialogue with Stone Point Capital and report any material\ndevelopments to the Board.\nOn December 8, 2021, representatives of Stone Point Capital contacted Mr. Ashworth by telephone to inform him of\ntheir intention to convey to him, on behalf of the Board, a letter indicating their interest in acquiring Tivity Health. Mr.\nAshworth acknowledged the information and committed to review any proposal with the Board. Following the call,\nrepresentatives of Stone Point Capital emailed to Mr. Ashworth their letter, indicating an interest in acquiring Tivity\nHealth for an indicative price of $33.00 in cash per outstanding share of Tivity Health Common Stock, representing an\napproximate 30% premium to the closing price of $25.36 on December 7, 2021. Stone Point Capital\u2019s offer\ncontemplated no financing condition but was expressly subject to the completion of due diligence review and final\napprovals from both parties. Mr. Ashworth promptly conveyed Stone Point Capital\u2019s letter to Mr. Sanfilippo and the\nother members of the Board.\nOn December 9, 2021, representatives of Lazard, Tivity Health\u2019s historical financial advisor, acting on the direction of\nMessrs. Sanfilippo and Ashworth, held a telephonic meeting with representatives of Stone Point Capital to ask\nclarifying questions about the indication of interest for the benefit of the Board\u2019s review of the proposal, including\nStone Point Capital\u2019s potential plans for the overall transaction timetable, due diligence investigation and financing.\nOn December 10, 2021, representatives of Stone Point Capital contacted Mr. Ashworth by telephone and inquired as\nto the status and timing of the Board\u2019s response, and Mr. Ashworth informed them that the Board would convene a\nmeeting later in the month and respond to their proposal in due course. With the information gathered from these\ndiscussions with Stone Point Capital, Messrs. Sanfilippo and Ashworth conferred individually with the other Board\nmembers to prepare for a Board meeting later in December to consider the proposal. In preparation for that meeting,\nMr. Sanfilippo directed Messrs. Ashworth and Holland to work with the management team to finalize management\u2019s\nlong-term forecast, building on the forecast work that was already underway as part of management\u2019s normal-course\nyear-end process, for presentation to the Board as part of its consideration of the proposal. Management continued\ndeveloping the long-term forecast over the succeeding two weeks.\nOn December 22, 2021, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, with representatives of Tivity Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement, Lazard and Tivity Health\u2019s outside counsel Bass, Berry & Sims PLC (\u201cBass Berry\u201d) present, to review\nStone Point Capital\u2019s proposal. Tivity Health\u2019s senior management began by presenting to the Board management\u2019s\ncurrent forecasted financial information for Tivity Health\u2019s business through the end of fiscal 2027 and underlying\nassumptions. Following discussion, the Board adopted the long-term forecast proposed by management which is\ndiscussed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Projections Prepared by Tivity Health\u2019s Management\u201d beginning on\npage 54 of this Proxy Statement. Representatives of Bass Berry reviewed for the Board the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties\nunder applicable law in the context of Stone Point Capital\u2019s proposal. Representatives of Lazard then reviewed Stone\nPoint Capital\u2019s proposal against several preliminary valuation methodologies, including a preliminary analysis of\ndiscounted cash flows based on management\u2019s long-range forecast. Representatives of Lazard also reviewed Stone\nPoint Capital\u2019s history of making large-scale acquisitions of this type and its likely ability to finance the transaction at\nthe valuation implied by Stone Point Capital\u2019s indicative proposal.\nRepresentatives of Lazard then reviewed potential process considerations for the Board in determining whether to\npursue further Stone Point Capital\u2019s proposal and, if the Board should direct it, outreach to other potentially\ninterested parties-including both financial sponsors and strategic buyers-to gauge interest from others in a possible\nacquisition of Tivity Health. Representatives of Lazard and Bass Berry responded to questions from the Board\nrelating to the structure and timing of such a process. The representatives of Lazard discussed with the Board the\nrisks and benefits of various market check strategies, from a full public auction-style solicitation of\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninterest, to a targeted outreach to a list of selected potential buyers likely to have both potential interest and the\nability to complete a transaction, to a single-bidder strategy of continuing discussions solely with Stone Point Capital\nwith no outreach to other parties. Following this discussion, the Board determined that a program of robust outreach\nto a significant number of potentially interested parties was the optimal approach for maximizing potential value and\nidentifying as many interested parties as would be feasible. The Lazard representatives reviewed with the Board a list\nof potentially interested counterparties, which included both financial sponsors and strategic counterparties. The list\nof strategic counterparties was smaller in number than financial sponsors, given the Board and management\u2019s input\nas to which strategic counterparties were either competitors or significant customers of Tivity Health, as well as\nLazard\u2019s view as to which potential counterparties were of sufficient scale to execute a transaction of the potential\nsize being contemplated. The Board further directed Lazard and Bass Berry to negotiate a suitable non-disclosure\nagreement with Stone Point Capital and, thereafter, to share certain nonpublic information about Tivity Health,\nincluding the long-range forecast, and to schedule a meeting between Stone Point Capital and Tivity Health\u2019s\nmanagement team in January 2022 to review such information. The Board also directed Lazard to prepare for outreach\nto the potentially interested parties beginning early in 2022 as discussed.\nAt its December 22, 2021 meeting, the Board also met in executive session and approved the formal engagement of\nLazard to act as Tivity Health\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the proposal from Stone Point Capital and the\nreview of strategic alternatives by the Board. Lazard was selected by the Board because of, among other reasons,\nLazard\u2019s significant experience advising public companies on strategic transactions in the healthcare and consumer\nindustries, Lazard\u2019s familiarity with Tivity Health and its strategy, and Lazard\u2019s previous work as Tivity Health\u2019s\nfinancial advisor in connection with the successful disposition of the Nutrition business in 2020.\nOn December 23, 2021, Mr. Ashworth spoke with representatives of Stone Point Capital by telephone and, at the\nBoard\u2019s direction, conveyed to them the Board\u2019s decision to allow Stone Point Capital to conduct a limited due\ndiligence review of certain information, subject to execution of a suitable non-disclosure agreement, and the Board\u2019s\nintention to undertake a process of evaluating strategic alternatives, including outreach to other parties deemed likely\nto have potential interest in a strategic transaction involving Tivity Health, in response to Stone Point Capital\u2019s\nproposal.\nOn December 24, 2021, Stone Point Capital conveyed an initial due diligence request list to Lazard. On December 27,\n2021, Lazard conveyed an initial draft of Tivity Health\u2019s non-disclosure agreement containing customary standstill\nprovisions to Stone Point Capital, which was negotiated between the parties and legal counsel over succeeding days\nand executed by Tivity Health and Stone Point Capital on December 30, 2021. Throughout this time and for the\ncoming weeks, Tivity Health\u2019s management and representatives of Lazard worked to compile due diligence\ninformation responsive to Stone Point Capital\u2019s request and otherwise likely to be of interest to prospective\ncounterparties into a virtual data room to be shared with any party that may express interest and enter into a suitable\nnon-disclosure agreement.\nOn January 7, 2022, Stone Point Capital was granted access to due diligence information through Tivity Health's\nvirtual data room and commenced due diligence as of that time.\nOn January 10, 2022, representatives of Lazard began contacting potential counterparties discussed with the Board at\nits December 22, 2021 meeting to gauge those parties\u2019 interest in an acquisition of Tivity Health. These contacts and\nsubsequent discussions took place over a period of several weeks, and ultimately 31 parties including Stone Point\nCapital (comprised of 28 financial sponsors and three strategic parties) were contacted by representatives of Lazard,\nat the direction of the Board. Following Lazard\u2019s outreach to the three potential strategic acquirers that had been\nidentified and discussed with the Board (\u201cStrategic Party A, B, and C\u201d), Strategic Party A requested the form of\nnondisclosure agreement, which Lazard conveyed to Strategic Party A. Both Strategic Party B and Strategic Party C\ndeclined to enter into a nondisclosure agreement and notified Lazard of their intention not to pursue a transaction\nwith Tivity Health on February 4, 2022 and January 29, 2022, respectively. In summary, of the 31 parties contacted\nincluding Stone Point Capital, 21 parties (comprised of 20 financial sponsors and one strategic party) entered into\nnon-disclosure agreements with Tivity Health containing customary standstill provisions and received initial\ninformation, including a confidential information memorandum that contained Tivity Health\u2019s long-range forecast.\nEach party executing a non-disclosure agreement was granted access to Tivity Health's virtual data room promptly\nafter execution. Of the 21 parties that entered into non-disclosure agreements, 15 parties (comprised of 14 financial\nsponsors and one strategic party) held limited meetings with management to review the information and ask\nquestions about Tivity Health\u2019s\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbusiness, financial performance and strategy. These contacts were conducted pursuant to a process letter authorized\nby Tivity Health and circulated by representatives of Lazard to all interested parties, including Stone Point Capital,\nnoting, among other things, the Board\u2019s expectation that each interested party should submit a written indication of\ninterest to Tivity Health by February 14, 2022 in order to remain in consideration and be allowed to continue in the\nprocess, if the Board should determine to allow them to do so following review of such party\u2019s indication of interest.\nOn January 11, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of senior management,\nLazard and Bass Berry present. The Board approved the expansion of the Board and addition of Stephanie Davis\nMichelman as a director, effective immediately, and Ms. Michelman joined the meeting after her appointment.\nThereafter, representatives of Lazard provided an update on engagement with Stone Point Capital subsequent to the\nprevious meeting of the Board, the gathering of due diligence materials and preparation of a confidential information\nmemorandum for potentially interested parties, and Lazard\u2019s efforts to contact the previously recommended potential\nbuyers to gauge potential interest. The Lazard representatives also conveyed Stone Point Capital\u2019s request for a\nmeeting with senior management to review the long-range forecast. The Board also discussed with representatives of\nLazard the possibility of Tivity Health approaching potential lenders to provide an indicative debt financing proposal\nthat could be shared with potential buyers to illustrate the feasibility and terms that could be available to finance an\nacquisition of Tivity Health. Following discussion, the Board directed Lazard and management to proceed with the\nproposed meeting with Stone Point Capital, in conjunction with Lazard\u2019s continuing outreach to other potential\ncounterparties.\nOn January 13, 2022, Messrs. Ashworth, Holland, Kunicki and Morrison and Raymond Bilbao, Tivity Health\u2019s Chief\nLegal Officer and Corporate Secretary, along with representatives of Lazard, held a virtual meeting with\nrepresentatives of Stone Point Capital to discuss Tivity Health\u2019s strategy, business performance and prospects.\nDuring the weeks following the January 11 meeting of the Board, discussions continued among Mr. Holland and\nother members of the senior management team, as well as consultation with Mr. Sanfilippo, Tivity Health\u2019s\nindependent Board Chair, and Ms. Russell, the Chair of the Audit Committee, and representatives of Lazard, about\npotential lenders that could be approached to provide indicative debt financing proposals for the benefit of\npotentially interested parties. At the direction of Tivity Health, Bass Berry prepared a form of non-disclosure\nagreement for prospective lenders, and on January 21, 2022 representatives of Lazard shared this non-disclosure\nagreement with two prospective lenders, both of whom executed those agreements after negotiation. Subsequently,\none of the lenders provided a financing proposal that was shared with prospective counterparties.\nOn January 26, 2022, representatives of Lazard, at the direction of the Board, conveyed a confidential information\nmemorandum containing Tivity Health\u2019s long-range forecast that had been approved by the Board at its meeting on\nDecember 22, 2021 to interested counterparties that were conducting due diligence, including Stone Point Capital.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board held a virtual meeting, with representatives of senior management, Lazard and Bass\nBerry present. At the meeting, Mr. Ashworth and representatives of Lazard provided an update to the Board on the\nprocess conducted to date, responses of the counterparties contacted as part of the outreach, and the level of\nongoing due diligence efforts for those counterparties that elected to continue participating in the process. The\nrepresentatives of Lazard also reviewed the efforts to procure an indicative debt financing package to be shared with\nprospective counterparties. Lazard also provided a further update on the efforts of Stone Point Capital, as the party\nwhose initial indication of interest had commenced the Board\u2019s process.\nOn January 30, 2022, representatives of Lazard, at the direction of the Board, conveyed a letter to Stone Point Capital\nand other counterparties on behalf of Tivity Health noting Tivity Health\u2019s expectation that first round indications of\ninterest would be expected to be delivered on or before February 14, 2022. The letter noted that any such proposals\nwould be reviewed by the Board and, if the Board determined to proceed with any party, that party would be\npermitted to conduct further due diligence and would be provided with a draft form of merger agreement to inform\nsecond-round proposals.\nOn February 3, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with representatives of senior management present, to, among other\nthings, review Tivity Health\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 performance and prepare for the upcoming earnings\nrelease and annual reporting cycle. At that meeting, Mr. Ashworth provided an update to the Board on ongoing due\ndiligence activity by and upcoming management meetings with interested counterparties.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 4, 2022, the first of the 14 virtual meetings between Tivity Health\u2019s management team and\nrepresentatives of Lazard with counterparties other than Stone Point Capital took place. On February 9, 2022, at Stone\nPoint Capital\u2019s request, a further virtual meeting was held among Messrs. Ashworth, Holland, Kunicki, Morrison, and\nBilbao along with representatives of Lazard, and representatives of Stone Point Capital to discuss follow-up\nquestions from Stone Point Capital about Tivity Health\u2019s business, strategy, forecast and customer base, among\nother matters.\nIn light of the breadth of interest in the process undertaken by Tivity Health and the resultant risk of a leak despite all\nreasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality, Tivity Health\u2019s senior management, in consultation with Mr. Sanfilippo\nand representatives of Lazard, determined that it would be advisable for Tivity Health to approach Customer A, one\nof Tivity Health\u2019s most significant customers, to inform Customer A, on a confidential basis, of the ongoing process\nand reassure Customer A of Tivity Health\u2019s commitment to their business relationship. On February 10, 2022, Mr.\nAshworth held a telephone call with a representative of Customer A to discuss these matters and respond to\nquestions.\nOn February 11, 2022, Strategic Party A entered into a non-disclosure agreement, and Lazard sent to Strategic Party A\nthe confidential information memorandum. On February 15, 2022, the last of the 14 management meetings conducted\nwith counterparties other than Stone Point Capital was conducted.\nOn February 14, 2022, Tivity Health\u2019s deadline for counterparties to submit first round indications of interest, Stone\nPoint Capital submitted a further written indication of interest reaffirming the price of $33.00 per share that had been\nreflected in its December 8, 2021, letter to Tivity Health. The February 14 Stone Point Capital letter noted that it\nremained subject to confirmatory due diligence, but that Stone Point Capital remained highly interested in completing\na transaction with Tivity Health and was prepared to move expeditiously to do so.\nNone of the other 30 counterparties contacted by Lazard on behalf of Tivity Health submitted a first-round indication\nof interest, either by the February 14 deadline or later. On February 16, 2022, Strategic Party A informed Lazard of its\nintention not to proceed further with the process. The other parties cited a number of reasons for their decisions not\nto pursue the process further, including lack of clear strategic fit with established businesses of their own or of their\nportfolio companies\u037e concerns about customer concentration in Tivity Health\u2019s SilverSneakers business\u037e ongoing\nconcerns about the impact of COVID-19 and resultant changes in consumer behavior on fitness activity, particularly\namong seniors\u037e and potential margin compression that could result from these factors and competitive pressures in\nthe marketplace. Representatives of Lazard transmitted to Tivity Health on February 17, 2022 a written memorandum\ndisclosing Lazard\u2019s material relationships with respect to Stone Point Capital, which notice Tivity Health promptly\ndelivered to the Board.\nOn February 18, 2022, the Board held a virtual meeting, with representatives of senior management, Lazard and Bass\nBerry present, to review the results of the first round of the process. Representatives of Lazard again reviewed the\nnature of the outreach to potential counterparties and the feedback received from the parties that had determined not\nto submit proposals. The Lazard representatives reviewed the Stone Point Capital proposal, noting that it reflected\nthe same value that Stone Point Capital had put forward on the basis of publicly available information in December,\nand compared the proposal to preliminary valuation analyses prepared by Lazard on the basis of Tivity Health\u2019s long-\nrange forecast, including a preliminary discounted cash flow analysis. The Lazard representatives reviewed potential\nprocess considerations for a second round with Stone Point Capital if the Board determined to continue. Following\ndiscussion with the representatives of senior management and Lazard, the Board unanimously determined to allow\nStone Point Capital to conduct further due diligence and directed Lazard to invite Stone Point Capital to submit a final\nindication of interest in March 2022. After this approval, representatives of Bass Berry reviewed a draft Merger\nAgreement to be provided to Stone Point Capital in conjunction with its due diligence review. After discussion, the\nBoard approved the draft Merger Agreement as presented and directed Lazard and Bass Berry to convey it to Stone\nPoint Capital.\nOn February 20, 2022, the draft Merger Agreement was made available to Stone Point Capital via Tivity Health\u2019s\nvirtual data room for the process.\nAfter market close on February 24, 2022, at which time the closing price of Tivity Health Common Stock on Nasdaq\nwas $26.09 per share, Tivity Health announced its earnings results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021. On\nFebruary 25, 2022, the Board held a virtual meeting, with representatives of senior management, Lazard and Bass\nBerry present, to discuss, among other things, stockholder interactions surrounding Tivity Health\u2019s earnings\nannouncement. Mr. Ashworth reported to the Board on stockholder meetings conducted to date\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand others still to come. Representatives of Lazard updated the Board on discussions with Stone Point Capital\nfollowing the Board\u2019s previous meeting, including Stone Point Capital\u2019s desire to contact potential financing sources\nfor the transaction in connection with its confirmatory due diligence review and final bid preparation. After\ndiscussion, the Board directed Lazard to allow Stone Point Capital to contact potential financing sources, subject to\nStone Point Capital allowing Lazard and Tivity Health\u2019s management team to vet all such contacts in advance.\nOn March 1, 2022, representatives of Tivity Health\u2019s senior management team and Lazard met with representatives of\nStone Point Capital at the offices of Bass Berry in Nashville, Tennessee for an all-day management presentation. In\nconnection with this meeting, the representatives of Stone Point Capital discussed their desired scope of outreach to\npotential sources of financing, and Tivity Health granted permission to begin outreach. The closing price of Tivity\nHealth Common Stock on Nasdaq on March 1, 2022 was $28.43 per share, an increase of approximately 9% from the\nclosing price immediately preceding Tivity Health\u2019s earnings announcement the previous week.\nOn March 2, 2022, Mr. Holland received a call from a longtime contact at one of the financing sources contacted by\nStone Point Capital the previous day inquiring about market rumors relating to Tivity Health and a potential strategic\nprocess. Mr. Holland responded to this inquiry by noting that Tivity Health\u2019s longstanding policy was not to\ncomment on any such market rumors, and he relayed this information to Mr. Ashworth, representatives of Lazard and\nBass Berry. On March 7, 2022, Tivity Health approved a further Stone Point Capital request to reach out to additional\npotential financing sources.\nOn March 7 through March 18, 2022 representatives of Tivity Health, Lazard and Bass Berry conducted a number of\nvirtual due diligence meetings with representatives of Stone Point Capital and its advisors, including Stone Point\nCapital\u2019s outside counsel, Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland & Ellis\u201d). These sessions covered a variety of matters,\nincluding quality of earnings, financial performance, information technology, legal and tax.\nOn March 8, 2022, representatives of Lazard conveyed to Stone Point Capital via a process letter the Board\u2019s\nexpectation that second round proposals would be received no later than March 28, 2022, and that second round\nproposals should be accompanied by a markup of the draft Merger Agreement previously provided and commitment\nletters for any planned financing.\nOn March 16, 2022, Tivity Health approved a further Stone Point Capital request to contact seven additional potential\ndebt financing sources. Tivity Health approved a further request by Stone Point Capital to contact one additional\npotential debt financing source on March 20, 2022.\nFrom March 21 through March 24, 2022, representatives of Tivity Health, Lazard and Bass Berry conducted additional\nvirtual due diligence meetings on additional topics, including Tivity Health\u2019s relationships with health plans, open\ndue diligence requests and adjustments to the quality of earnings analysis. On March 21, 2022, Messrs. Ashworth\nand Holland, along with Tommy Lewis, Tivity Health\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, Jessica Erb, Tivity Health\u2019s Senior Vice\nPresident of Client Relations, Caroline Khalil, Tivity Health\u2019s Senior Vice President of Fitness Operations, and\nrepresentatives of Lazard met with senior management of Stone Point Capital in Nashville, Tennessee and discussed\nTivity Health\u2019s business, strategy and operations.\nDuring the week of March 21, 2022, Stone Point Capital conveyed to Lazard an intention to submit a second-round\nbid package by the deadline of March 28, 2022, but noted that, due in part to uncertainties in the capital markets\nbrought about by inflationary price shocks and the ongoing war in Ukraine, they were unlikely to have all of the\nfinancing commitments ready to accompany the bid package by that date. Lazard conveyed this information to\nMessrs. Sanfilippo and Ashworth, along with other members of senior management and Bass Berry.\nOn March 22, 2022, representatives of Kirkland & Ellis and Bass Berry conducted a telephone call in which Kirkland\n& Ellis conveyed their expectation to send to Bass Berry imminently a markup of the draft Merger Agreement\nreflecting Stone Point Capital\u2019s preliminary positions on certain terms and conditions. Later that evening, Kirkland &\nEllis sent the markup to Bass Berry. On March 25, 2022, Bass Berry and Kirkland & Ellis conducted a videoconference\nin which Bass Berry asked clarifying questions about some of the positions taken in the markup ahead of the\ndeadline of March 28, 2022. The trading price of Tivity Health Common Stock on Nasdaq closed at $29.69 on March\n25, 2022.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn March 27, 2022, representatives of Stone Point Capital and Lazard spoke by telephone, and Stone Point Capital\nagain noted an intent to deliver a bid package the next day, but likely with debt financing commitment papers to\nfollow at a date soon thereafter.\nOn March 28, 2022, Stone Point Capital delivered to Lazard an updated proposal letter, along with a markup of the\nMerger Agreement, an equity commitment letter and limited guarantee from Stone Point Capital affiliates supporting\nthe transaction. The proposal letter reflected a price of $31.50 per share, a decrease of $1.50 per share from the $33.00\nproposal price in each of Stone Point Capital\u2019s December 2021 and February 2022 letters. Stone Point Capital noted to\nLazard that the primary reason for this decrease was an increase in costs of financing that Stone Point Capital\nexpected to incur for the transaction, in large part due to the deterioration in the financing markets subsequent to the\ndelivery of its earlier proposals, as a result of increased Federal Reserve focus on taming near- and intermediate-term\ninflation and recessionary risks. Representatives of Lazard conveyed the bid package to the Board that day. Given\nthe incompleteness of the proposal without debt financing commitments and lack of certainty as to when it would be\navailable, however, after consulting with other members of the Board, Mr. Sanfilippo determined not to schedule a\nmeeting of the Board to review the proposal until such time as the debt commitment was received.\nDuring the week of March 28, 2022, Tivity Health Common Stock continued to trade upward on Nasdaq, closing at\n$29.80 on Monday, March 28 and rising to $32.61 by Friday, April 1. On March 30, 2022, Tivity Health Common Stock\nclosed at $32.09. That same day, Stone Point Capital conveyed to Lazard an executed debt commitment letter from its\nfinancing sources in support of the transaction, and Lazard relayed the debt commitment letter to the Board,\nmanagement, and Bass Berry.\nOn the morning of April 3, 2022, the Board conducted a virtual meeting, attended by representatives of senior\nmanagement, Lazard and Bass Berry, to review Stone Point Capital\u2019s offer. Representatives of Lazard reviewed the\nStone Point Capital $31.50 proposal and again compared it to updated preliminary valuation analyses, including a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis, as well as comparative stock price analysis, and other measures. In connection with\ndiscussing the assumptions underlying these valuation methodologies, representatives of senior management\nconfirmed that there had been no developments that had changed management\u2019s view of the long-range forecast or\ncaused management to believe that it should be revised or replaced as a basis for Lazard\u2019s valuation analysis and the\nBoard\u2019s evaluation of the Stone Point Capital proposal. The Lazard representatives also reviewed the financing\npackage put forward by Stone Point Capital and discussed Stone Point Capital\u2019s rationale for the lowering of its\nproposal price given deterioration in the financing markets.\nThe Lazard representatives further reviewed information regarding the trading metrics of Tivity Health Common Stock\nthat informed Lazard\u2019s view that the trading price of Tivity Health Common Stock may have been inflated by market\nrumors of the transaction, including stock price increases in early March after Stone Point Capital\u2019s outreach to\npotential debt financing sources was conducted, and a further increase during the week of trading after the March 28\nproposal date, in which trading prices were approaching the original $33.00 price reflected in Stone Point Capital\u2019s\nfirst two proposal letters. Representatives of Bass Berry discussed the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under Delaware law\nand reviewed open issues presented by the proposal draft from Stone Point Capital, including a proposed termination\nfee payable by Tivity Health under certain circumstances of 3.5% of equity value, and a proposed reverse termination\nfee of 4.75% of equity value payable by Stone Point Capital under certain circumstances and serving as an overall\ncap on damages for any breach, including any willful breach, of the Merger Agreement by Stone Point Capital.\nRepresentatives of Bass Berry and Lazard discussed the range of termination and reverse termination fees in\nprecedent transactions. Representatives of Lazard and Bass Berry then reviewed potential counterproposals that the\nBoard could make if it determined to continue discussions with Stone Point Capital. After discussion of various\nalternatives, the Board unanimously approved a direction to Mr. Ashworth and Lazard to convey a counterproposal\nto Stone Point Capital including a price of $33.25 per share, a termination fee of 2.75% of equity value, a reverse\ntermination fee of 7.25% of equity value, and without capping damages at the reverse termination fee amount in the\nevent of Stone Point Capital\u2019s willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement. The Board directed Bass Berry to\ndeliver to Kirkland & Ellis revised drafts of all transaction documents as promptly as possible after the counteroffer\ncould be conveyed.\nAt approximately noon on April 3, 2022, Mr. Ashworth and representatives of Lazard spoke with representatives of\nStone Point Capital and conveyed the Board\u2019s counteroffer, and Tivity Health\u2019s willingness to work quickly to reach\nagreement on those terms. The Stone Point Capital representatives confirmed their understanding of the\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncounteroffer and committed to respond after further consideration, including from Stone Point Capital\u2019s investment\ncommittee. Shortly after the conclusion of this discussion, Bass Berry conveyed to Kirkland & Ellis revised drafts of\nthe Merger Agreement and all other major transaction documents.\nDuring the evening of April 3, 2022, representatives of Stone Point Capital conveyed to Mr. Ashworth by telephone\nthat they would not be in a position to respond to the Board\u2019s counteroffer that day, and would communicate a\nresponse to him when ready. Mr. Ashworth updated the Board by email that Stone Point Capital would not be\nproviding a response to the Board\u2019s counteroffer that evening.\nOn the morning of April 4, 2022, representatives of Stone Point Capital contacted Mr. Ashworth and Lazard and\ninformed them of a further counterproposal, including a price of $32.00 per share, a termination fee of 3.25% of equity\nvalue and a reverse termination fee of 6.5% of equity value, which would also serve as a cap on damages for willful\nand material breach of the Merger Agreement by Stone Point Capital. Mr. Ashworth and Lazard committed to convey\nthis to the Board later that same day.\nOn April 4, 2022, the closing price of Tivity Health Common Stock on Nasdaq was $32.25. Shortly after the close of\ntrading on Nasdaq that day, the Board held a virtual meeting attended by representatives of senior management,\nLazard and Bass Berry to review the revised proposal from Stone Point Capital. Representatives of Lazard reviewed\nthe revised offer and noted that the price remained within the range implied by the discounted cash flows analysis,\namong other valuation analyses, that Lazard had conducted based on Tivity Health\u2019s long-range forecast. After\ndiscussion, the Board directed Mr. Ashworth and Lazard to convey a further counteroffer to include a price of $32.65\nand accepting of the other positions put forward by Stone Point Capital on the termination fees.\nIn the early evening of April 4, 2022, Mr. Ashworth and representatives of Lazard spoke with representatives of Stone\nPoint Capital by telephone and conveyed the Board\u2019s revised counteroffer. The Stone Point Capital representatives\nconfirmed their understanding of the counteroffer and committed to give the counteroffer further consideration,\nincluding by Stone Point Capital\u2019s investment committee.\nLater in the evening of April 4, 2022, representatives of Stone Point Capital spoke by telephone with Mr. Ashworth\nand representatives of Lazard and conveyed a \u201cbest and final\u201d revised proposal of $32.50 per share. Mr. Ashworth\ncommitted to present the revised proposal to the Board and respond promptly.\nStill later in the evening of April 4, 2022, the Board held a virtual meeting, with representatives of senior management,\nLazard and Bass Berry present, to review the revised proposal from Stone Point Capital. After discussion, the Board\nunanimously determined to accept the proposed price of $32.50 and directed management, Lazard and Bass Berry to\nconvey this agreement to Stone Point Capital and to work through the night to finalize all transaction documentation\nahead of a Board meeting the following morning to consider the transaction for final approval.\nShortly thereafter, Mr. Ashworth and representatives of Lazard conveyed the Board\u2019s position to representatives of\nStone Point Capital, and throughout the night of April 4, 2022, representatives of Tivity Health, Lazard, Bass Berry,\nStone Point Capital and Kirkland & Ellis worked to finalize all transaction terms. Early in the morning of April 5, 2022,\nbefore the opening of Nasdaq for trading, the Board met (the \u201cApril 5 Meeting\u201d) to consider the Merger Agreement\nand other transaction documentation in final form. Representatives of Lazard presented materials reviewing Stone\nPoint Capital\u2019s proposal, certain trading metrics of Tivity Health Common Stock that informed Lazard\u2019s view that the\ntrading price may have been inflated by market rumors of the transaction, and Lazard\u2019s financial analysis of the\nMerger and delivered Lazard's oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated\nas of April 5, 2022, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review described in such opinion,\nthe Transaction Consideration to be paid to holders of Tivity Health Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) in\nthe Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nFor a detailed discussion of Lazard\u2019s opinion, please see below under the caption \u201cThe Merger-Opinion of Tivity\nHealth\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d. Representatives of Bass Berry reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties and a\nsummary of the key terms of a substantially final version of the Merger Agreement that had been negotiated with\nStone Point Capital in connection with the proposed transaction. After further discussion of the proposed\ntransaction (see below under the captions \u201cThe Merger-Recommendation of the Board of Directors\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand Reasons for the Merger\u201d), the Board unanimously adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement,\ndeclared that the Merger Agreement was in the best interests of Tivity Health and its stockholders, and\nrecommended that Tivity Health\u2019s stockholders approve the Merger Agreement. The Board directed representatives\nof Bass Berry to continue to finalize the terms of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the summary of terms\nreviewed with the Board.\nFollowing the April 5 Meeting, the parties finalized and executed the Merger Agreement and the schedules thereto\nand received executed final copies of the limited guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter, and the Debt Commitment\nLetter.\nOn the morning of April 5, 2022, prior to the opening of trading of Tivity Health Common Stock on Nasdaq, Tivity\nHealth and Stone Point Capital issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.\nRecommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Board to Adopt the Merger Agreement, Thereby Approving the Merger, the Merger\nAgreement and the Transactions Contemplated by the Merger Agreement\nOn April 5, 2022, the Board, after considering various factors, including those described in this section below, and\nafter consultation with Tivity Health\u2019s outside legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i) determined that the terms\nof the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best\ninterests of, Tivity Health and its stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of Tivity Health and its\nstockholders to enter into, and approved, adopted and declared advisable, the Merger Agreement, (iii) approved the\nexecution and delivery by Tivity Health of the Merger Agreement, the performance by Tivity Health of its covenants\nand agreements contained therein and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions\ncontained therein, (iv) directed that the approval of the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to the\nstockholders of Tivity Health, and (v) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Tivity Health vote in favor of\nthe approval of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby\napproving the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the non-\nbinding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be payable by Tivity Health to its named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Merger and contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the\nproposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate,\nincluding to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the\nMerger Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is not initially obtained.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn recommending that Tivity Health\u2019s stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to approve the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement, the Board, including its independent directors, considered a number of potentially positive\nfactors, including, but not limited to, the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative\nimportance):\n\u2022\nAttractive Value. The Board believed that the Transaction Consideration represents attractive value for the\nshares of Tivity Health Common Stock, based on, among other things, the Board\u2019s familiarity with Tivity\nHealth\u2019s current and historical financial condition, results of operations, business, competitive position and\nprospects, as well as Tivity Health\u2019s business plan and potential long-term value\u037e and, after a thorough\nreview of the process conducted, the Board determined that $32.50 per share in cash pursuant to the terms\nof the Merger Agreement affords the best value reasonably available for holders of Tivity Health Common\nStock.\n\u2022\nForm of Consideration. The Board considered that the Transaction Consideration is all cash, which\nprovides stockholders certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, as\ncompared to stock consideration whose value fluctuates, while eliminating exposure to long term business\nand execution risks.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nRisks Inherent in Tivity Health\u2019s Business Plan\u037e Strategic Alternatives. The Board considered Tivity\nHealth\u2019s historical results of operations, recent reorientation of strategy following leadership changes at\nboth the Board and senior management levels beginning in 2020, short-term and long-term strategic goals\nand the Tivity Health Projections (which are described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Projections\nPrepared by Tivity Health\u2019s Management\u201d beginning on page 54 of this Proxy Statement) and the perceived\nchallenges and risks associated with Tivity Health\u2019s ability to meet the Tivity Health Projections in light of\nthe heavily competitive senior fitness landscape\u037e the considerable degree of customer concentration in\nTivity Health\u2019s SilverSneakers business\u037e the potential for ongoing, and possibly increasing, pressure on\nTivity Health\u2019s pricing and margins in its core businesses as a result of the foregoing factors\u037e the ongoing\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic\u037e the fact that the recent reorientation of Tivity Health\u2019s strategy meant\nthat several key strategic initiatives were still in their nascency and had not yet demonstrated a track record\nof delivering proven long-term results\u037e and Tivity Health\u2019s uncertain ability to retain management talent in\nan intensely competitive market environment, as well as the risks and uncertainties described in the \u201crisk\nfactors\u201d and \u201cforward looking statements\u201d sections of Tivity Health\u2019s disclosures filed with the SEC,\nincluding that Tivity Health\u2019s actual financial results in future periods could differ materially and adversely\nfrom the projected results. Following such review, the Board determined that the combination of value and\ncertainty offered to Tivity Health\u2019s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement is more favorable to\nTivity Health\u2019s stockholders than the alternative of remaining an independent public company, along with\nthe risks inherent in doing so.\n\u2022\nPremium to Market Prices. The Board considered that the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share in\ncash, to be received by the holders of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock in the Merger, represents a\nsignificant premium over the market price at which shares of Tivity Health Common Stock traded at times\nbefore receipt of the Stone Point Capital Proposal. The Board further considered the possibility that the\nprevailing trading price of Tivity Health Common Stock immediately prior to execution of the Merger\nAgreement may have been inflated by market rumors of the potential transaction, borne out by stock price\nincreases in early March after Stone Point Capital\u2019s lender outreach was conducted, and a further increase\nduring the week of trading after the March 28 proposal date, in which trading prices were approaching the\noriginal $33.00 price reflected in Stone Point Capital\u2019s first two proposal letters. From February 28, 2022, the\nday prior to Stone Point Capital\u2019s initial lender outreach, to April 4, 2022, Tivity Health\u2019s stock price had\nincreased approximately 18%, while the S&P 500 had increased approximately 5% and the Nasdaq increased\napproximately 6% over the same span. The Board\u2019s considerations included that the Transaction\nConsideration of $32.50 per share represents a premium of:\n\u2022\napproximately 28% over the closing stock price on December 7, 2021, the last trading day prior to the\n$33.00 per share unsolicited proposal from Stone Point Capital\u037e\n\u2022\napproximately 31% over the closing stock price on January 7, 2022, the last trading day prior to the\ncommencement of outreach to potential buyers\u037e\n\u2022\napproximately 19% over the closing stock price on February 28, 2022, the last trading day prior to the\ncommencement of Stone Point Capital\u2019s outreach to potential debt financing sources\u037e and\n\u2022\napproximately 18% over the volume weighted average stock price of shares of Tivity Health Common\nStock during the 90-day period ended April 4, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement of\nthe proposed Merger.\n\u2022\nValuation Multiple. The Board considered that the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share in cash,\nto be received by the holders of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock in the Merger, represents a\nvaluation of Tivity Health at a multiple of approximately 12.1 times Tivity Health\u2019s last twelve-month\n(\u201cLTM\u201d) Adjusted EBITDA for the period ending March 31, 2022.\n\u2022\nFinancial Analyses and Opinion of Lazard. The Board considered the financial analyses of Lazard and the\nopinion of Lazard, dated April 5, 2022, to the Board to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and\nsubject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Lazard\u2019s\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nopinion, the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 in cash per share to be received by Tivity Health\nstockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, as described in the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger-Opinion of Tivity Health\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 46 of this\nProxy Statement.\n\u2022\nRobust Market Check. The Board considered that, following receipt by Tivity Health on December 7, 2021\nof Stone Point Capital\u2019s initial written proposal, Tivity Health, acting at the Board\u2019s direction and with the\nassistance of Lazard as its independent financial advisor, identified and discussed possible interest in a\npotential transaction with 31 potential bidders including Stone Point Capital (comprised of 28 financial\nsponsors and three strategic parties) that the Board, with the assistance of Lazard, determined would be\nmost likely to have sufficient financial capacity and industry experience and/or overlap with Tivity Health\u2019s\nbusiness to have the capability and interest to execute a transaction but were not also either competitors or\nsignificant customers of Tivity Health. Of these, 21 parties (comprised of 20 financial sponsors and one\nstrategic party) entered into non-disclosure agreements with Tivity Health and received initial information,\nincluding a confidential information memorandum that contained Tivity Health\u2019s long-range forecast. Of\nthose, 15 parties (comprised of 14 financial sponsors and one strategic party) held limited meetings with\nmanagement to review the information and ask questions about Tivity Health\u2019s business, financial\nperformance and strategy. Further, at the direction of the Board, and with the assistance of Lazard, Tivity\nHealth secured and shared with potential bidders an indicative debt financing proposal to illustrate the\nfeasibility and potentially available terms for financing an acquisition of Tivity Health. Following\ndiscussions with such counterparties and groups, none of the counterparties other than Stone Point\nCapital was willing to submit a written indication of interest in a strategic transaction with Tivity Health, let\nalone on terms and conditions more favorable than those offered by Stone Point Capital.\n\u2022\nTiming of Closing. The Board considered that the Merger is anticipated to be completed during or prior to\nthe third quarter of 2022, a relatively expedient timeframe for closing that would mitigate the potential risks\nto the business during the interim operating period, including due to uncertainties experienced by clients,\nemployees and other stakeholders.\n\u2022\nArms-Length Negotiations. The Board considered that the Board and Tivity Health\u2019s senior management,\nin coordination with Tivity Health\u2019s independent legal and financial advisors, vigorously negotiated on an\narms-length basis with Stone Point Capital with respect to price and other terms and conditions of the\nMerger Agreement, including obtaining a price increase of $1.00 from the price of $31.50 per share\nproposed by Stone Point Capital\u2019s final indication of interest as reflected in its letter of March 28, 2022 to a\nprice of $32.50 per share pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and the Board\u2019s belief that it had negotiated\nthe best value and terms reasonably attainable from Stone Point Capital.\n\u2022\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered that the terms of the Merger Agreement, including\nthe respective representations, warranties, covenants and termination rights of the parties and the\ntermination fees payable by Tivity Health and Parent, are reasonable and customary. The Board also\nbelieved that the terms of the Merger Agreement included the most favorable terms reasonably attainable\nfrom Stone Point Capital.\n\u2022\nConditions to the Consummation of the Merger\u037e Likelihood of Closing. The Board considered the\nlikelihood of satisfaction of conditions to closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement in light of the conditions in the Merger Agreement to the obligations of Parent\nand Merger Sub.\n\u2022\nRegulatory Considerations. The Board considered that, while the closing of the Merger is subject to\ncertain regulatory approvals, there are not likely to be significant antitrust or other regulatory impediments\nto the closing of the Merger given the asset mix of Stone Point Capital\u2019s portfolio companies. The Board\nalso considered that the Merger Agreement requires that Parent and Merger Sub agree to take promptly\nany and all steps necessary or reasonably advisable or as may be required by any governmental authority\nto avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any antitrust laws that may\nbe required by any governmental authority so as to enable the parties to consummate the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, as\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexpeditiously as possible (and in any event at least five (5) business days prior to the \u201cEnd Date\u201d (i.e.,\n12:01 a.m. (New York City time) on October 5, 2022)), including the actions described in the section entitled\n\u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement-Efforts to Close the Merger\u201d beginning on page 82 of this Proxy\nStatement.\n\u2022\nFinancing\u037e No Financing Condition. The Board considered Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s representations\nand covenants contained in the Merger Agreement relating to the financing commitments from affiliates of\nStone Point Capital, the delivery by Parent of a debt commitment letter by nationally reputable financial\ninstitutions (and the terms and conditions thereof) and that the Merger is not subject to a financing\ncondition. Further, the Board considered that under specified circumstances, the Merger Agreement\npermits Tivity Health to seek specific performance against Parent and Merger Sub with respect to the\nfinancing commitments, including under Tivity Health\u2019s third-party beneficiary rights pursuant to the\nequity commitment letter provided by certain affiliates of Stone Point Capital.\n\u2022\nReverse Termination Fee. The Board considered the ability of Tivity Health to, under certain\ncircumstances, receive a reverse termination fee of approximately $100.4 million, plus up to $7.5 million in\nenforcement costs, as described in the section entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fees\u201d\nbeginning on page 88 of this Proxy Statement.\n\u2022\nAbility to Respond to Certain Unsolicited Takeover Proposals. The Board considered that, while the\nMerger Agreement restricts Tivity Health\u2019s ability to solicit competing bids to acquire Tivity Health, the\nBoard has rights, under certain circumstances, to engage in discussions with, and provide information to,\nthird parties submitting unsolicited takeover proposals and to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to\nenter into an alternative acquisition agreement that the Board determines to reflect a superior proposal,\nsubject to payment of a termination fee of approximately $54.4 million. The Board further considered that\nthe timing of the Merger would provide ample opportunity for any third parties to submit proposals and\nthat the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the size of the termination fee (which is consistent with\nor below fees in comparable transactions), would be unlikely to deter such third parties from submitting\nsuch proposals.\n\u2022\nChange of Recommendation. The Board considered that it has the right to make a Company Adverse\nRecommendation Change to Tivity Health\u2019s stockholders in the event of a superior proposal or an\nintervening event if the Board reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal\ncounsel and financial advisors) that the failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent\nwith the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to payment of a termination fee of\napproximately $54.4 million if Parent and Merger Sub terminate the Merger Agreement in response to such\nCompany Adverse Recommendation Change.\n\u2022\nStockholder Approval. The Board considered that the consummation of the Merger is subject to the\napproval of Tivity Health\u2019s stockholders, who will have the opportunity to adopt or reject the Merger\nAgreement.\n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights with respect to the Merger for\nTivity Health stockholders who properly exercise their rights under the DGCL, which would give these\nstockholders the ability to seek and be paid a judicially determined appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their\nshares at the completion of the Merger, as described in the section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d beginning\non page 95 of this Proxy Statement.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Board also considered and balanced against the potentially positive factors a number of uncertainties, risks and\nother potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the Merger and the other transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in\norder of relative importance):\n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered that Tivity Health\u2019s\nstockholders will lose the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value that could occur if Tivity\nHealth continued as an independent public company and was able to successfully execute on its current\nstrategy.\n\u2022\nImpact of Announcement on Tivity Health. The Board considered that the announcement and pendency of\nthe Merger, or the failure to consummate the Merger, may disrupt Tivity Health\u2019s business operations or\ndivert employees\u2019 attention away from Tivity Health\u2019s day-to-day operations, result in significant costs to\nTivity Health or harm Tivity Health\u2019s relationships with its employees and customers.\n\u2022\nTax Treatment. The Board considered that the all-cash transaction would be taxable to holders of Tivity\nHealth Common Stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\u2022\nClosing Certainty. The Board considered that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019\nobligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied.\n\u2022\nPre-Closing Covenants. The Board considered the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on Tivity Health\u2019s\nconduct of business prior to completion of the Merger, which could delay or prevent Tivity Health from\nundertaking business opportunities that may arise or taking other actions with respect to its operations\nduring the pendency of the Merger without Parent\u2019s consent.\n\u2022\nNo Solicitation. The Board considered the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on Tivity Health\u2019s ability\nto solicit competing bids to acquire Tivity Health during the pendency of the Merger and that, subject to\ncertain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, in the event of Tivity Health\u2019s receipt of a Company\nSuperior Proposal, Tivity Health is required to negotiate in good faith with Parent (if requested by Parent)\nregarding revisions to the Merger Agreement, which the Board must take into account in determining\nwhether to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such Company Superior\nProposal.\n\u2022\nAdverse Recommendation Change. The Board considered the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the\nBoard\u2019s ability to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and that, subject to certain\nconditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, in the event of a potential Company Adverse\nRecommendation Change by the Board, Tivity Health is required to negotiate in good faith with Parent (if\nrequested by Parent) regarding revisions to the Merger Agreement, which the Board must take into\naccount in determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.\n\u2022\nTermination Fee. The Board considered the termination fee of approximately $54.4 million that could\nbecome payable to Parent under specified circumstances, including upon the termination of the Merger\nAgreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a Company Superior\nProposal, which may discourage third parties that might otherwise have an interest in a business\ncombination with, or acquisition of, Tivity Health from making unsolicited proposals (although the Board\nconcluded that the termination fee is reasonable in amount, consistent with or below fees in comparable\ntransactions and will not unduly deter any other party that might be interested in acquiring Tivity Health).\n\u2022\nLimited Specific Performance Remedy\u037e Reverse Termination Fee. The Board considered that Parent and\nMerger Sub are newly formed entities with essentially no assets other than equity and debt commitments,\nand that, notwithstanding Tivity Health\u2019s specific performance remedy under the Merger Agreement, Tivity\nHealth\u2019s remedy in the event of breach of the Merger Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub may be limited to\nreceipt of the reverse termination fee provided under the Merger Agreement, which is guaranteed by\ncertain affiliates of Stone Point Capital, and that the reverse termination fee is not available in all instances\nwhere the Merger Agreement may be terminated and may not sufficiently compensate Tivity Health for\nadverse effects arising out of such termination of the Merger Agreement.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nCap on Damages. The Board considered that Stone Point Capital\u2019s aggregate monetary damages under the\nMerger Agreement cannot exceed approximately $100.4 million plus up to $7.5 million in reimbursement of\nTivity Health\u2019s enforcement costs, if applicable.\n\u2022\nLoss of Key Personnel. The Board considered the risk that, despite retention efforts prior to consummation\nof the Merger, Tivity Health may lose key personnel.\n\u2022\nLitigation. The Board considered the risk of potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be\ninstituted against Tivity Health or its directors and officers, and the potential effects of any outcomes\nrelated thereto.\n\u2022\nExpenses. The Board considered the risk that, if the Merger is not consummated, Tivity Health will, with\ncertain exceptions, be required to pay its own expenses associated with the Merger Agreement and the\nMerger.\n\u2022\nDirector and Officer Interests. The Board considered that Tivity Health\u2019s directors and officers may have\ninterests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Tivity Health stockholders\ngenerally, as described in the sections entitled \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and\nManagement\u201d and \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the\nMerger\u201d beginning on pages 93 and 56 of this Proxy Statement, respectively.\n\u2022\nForward-Looking Statements. The Board considered risks of the type and nature described in the section\nentitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d, beginning on page 25 of this\nProxy Statement.\nAfter taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Board concluded that the risks,\nuncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the Merger were outweighed by the\npotential benefits of, and potentially positive factors associated with, the Merger to Tivity Health\u2019s stockholders.\nThe foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but summarizes the\nmaterial factors considered by the Board. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with their\nevaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify\nor otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching their determinations and\nrecommendations. Moreover, each member of the Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the\nprocess and may have given different weight to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific\ndetermination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its\nultimate determinations. The Board based its recommendations on the totality of the information presented,\nincluding thorough discussions with, and questioning of, Tivity Health\u2019s senior management and the Board\u2019s\nindependent legal and financial advisors. This explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain information\npresented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the\nsection entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 25 of this\nProxy Statement.\nOpinion of Tivity Health\u2019s Financial Advisor\nTivity Health retained Lazard to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. In connection with this\nengagement, Tivity Health requested that Lazard evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of\nTivity Health Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) of the Transaction Consideration to be paid to such\nholders in the Merger. On April 5, 2022, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the Merger Agreement and the\nMerger, Lazard rendered to the Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated\nApril 5, 2022, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken described in such opinion,\nthe Transaction Consideration to be paid to holders of Tivity Health Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) in\nthe Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of Lazard\u2019s written opinion, dated April 5, 2022, which describes the assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B and\nis incorporated by reference in this document. The summary of the written opinion of Lazard, dated April 5, 2022,\nset forth in this Proxy Statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLazard\u2019s opinion attached as Annex B. Lazard\u2019s opinion was for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) and\nLazard\u2019s opinion was rendered to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and did not address any\nterms or other aspects (other than the Transaction Consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard\u2019s\nopinion) of the Merger. Lazard\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other\ntransaction or business strategy in which Tivity Health might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by\nTivity Health to engage in the Merger. Lazard\u2019s opinion is not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation\nto any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any matter relating\nthereto.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Lazard, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft dated April 4, 2022 of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to Tivity Health\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to Lazard by Tivity Health relating to the\nbusiness of Tivity Health and extrapolations thereto based on the guidance of management of Tivity Health\nand approved by the Board (the \u201cTivity Health Projections\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nheld discussions with members of the senior management of Tivity Health with respect to the business and\nprospects of Tivity Health\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business that Lazard\nbelieved to be generally relevant in evaluating the business of Tivity Health\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of business that\nLazard believed to be comparable in certain respects to the business of Tivity Health\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of Tivity Health Common Stock\u037e and\n\u2022\nconducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Lazard deemed appropriate.\nLazard assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent\nverification of such information. Lazard did not conduct any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets\nor liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Tivity Health or concerning the solvency or fair value of Tivity Health, and\nLazard was not furnished with any such valuation or appraisal. With respect to the financial forecasts utilized in\nLazard\u2019s analyses, Lazard assumed, with the consent of Tivity Health, that they had been reasonably prepared on\nbases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of Tivity\nHealth. Lazard assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions on\nwhich they are based.\nFurther, Lazard\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on,\nand the information made available to Lazard as of, the date of its opinion. In addition, Lazard noted that the current\nvolatility and disruption in the credit and financial markets relating to, among others, the COVID-19 pandemic and\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine may have an effect on Tivity Health and Lazard did not express an opinion as to the\neffects of such volatility or such disruption on Tivity Health.\nLazard assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring\nafter the date of its opinion. Lazard did not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock may trade at any time subsequent to the announcement of the Merger. In addition, Lazard\u2019s opinion\ndid not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which\nTivity Health might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by Tivity Health to engage in the Merger.\nIn rendering its opinion, Lazard assumed, with the consent of the Board, that the Merger will be consummated on the\nterms described in the Merger Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions.\nRepresentatives of Tivity Health advised Lazard, and Lazard assumed, that the Merger Agreement, when executed,\nwould conform to the draft reviewed by Lazard in all material respects. Lazard also assumed, with the consent of the\nBoard, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the Merger\nwill not have an adverse effect on Tivity Health or the Merger. Lazard did not express any opinion as to any tax or\nother consequences that might result from the Merger, nor did Lazard\u2019s opinion\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naddress any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Lazard understood that Tivity Health obtained\nsuch advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to any\nterms or other aspects (other than the Transaction Consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard\u2019s\nopinion) of the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger or any agreements or\narrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the Merger. In addition, Lazard expressed no view\nor opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any\nofficers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Transaction\nConsideration or otherwise.\nSummary of the Financial Analyses of Tivity Health\u2019s Financial Advisor\nIn preparing its opinion to the Board, Lazard performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The summary\nset forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors\nconsidered by, and underlying Lazard\u2019s opinion, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the\nrelative importance or weight given to those financial analyses. The preparation of a financial opinion or analysis is a\ncomplex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial\nanalysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion or\nanalysis is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Lazard considered the results of\nall of the analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with\nregard to any particular factor or method of analysis considered by it. Rather, Lazard made its determination as to\nfairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.\nAccordingly, Lazard believes that its analyses and factors summarized below must be considered as a whole and in\ncontext. Lazard further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information\npresented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses\nand factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.\nIn performing its analyses, Lazard considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions and other matters, existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Tivity\nHealth. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to Tivity Health or its\nbusiness or the Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the\nanalyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning business, financial and operating characteristics\nand other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or\ntransactions reviewed or views regarding the comparability of such companies, businesses or transactions.\nAccordingly, such analyses may not necessarily include all companies, businesses or transactions that could be\ndeemed relevant. The estimates of the future performance of Tivity Health in or underlying Lazard\u2019s analyses and the\nranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive\nof future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested\nby the analyses. These estimates are necessarily subject to uncertainty because, among other things, they are based\nupon numerous factors and events beyond the control of Tivity Health and its advisors. In addition, analyses\nrelating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a\ncompany may actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future.\nAccordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular\nanalysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken as the views of\nLazard regarding the actual values of Tivity Health. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information,\nto the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before April 5, 2022, and is not\nnecessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nLazard did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the\nMerger. The type and amount of Transaction Consideration payable in the Merger was determined through\nnegotiations between Tivity Health and Stone Point Capital rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved\nby the Board. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board. Lazard\u2019s opinion and\nanalyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the Merger and the Transaction\nConsideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or management with respect to\nthe Merger or the Transaction Consideration payable in the Merger.\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFinancial Analyses\nThe summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled \u201cOpinion of Tivity Health\u2019s Financial\nAdvisor - Financial Analyses\u201d is a summary of the material financial analyses provided by Lazard in connection\nwith its opinion, dated April 5, 2022, to the Board. The summary set forth below is not a comprehensive description\nof all analyses undertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of the analyses in the\nsummary below indicate that any analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. The financial analyses\nsummarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Lazard\u2019s financial\nanalyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a\ncomplete description of the financial analyses performed by Lazard. Considering the data set forth in the tables\nbelow without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and\nassumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses\nperformed by Lazard. Future results may differ from those described and such differences may be material.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nLazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Tivity Health by calculating, based on the Tivity Health\nProjections, the estimated present value (as of March 31, 2022) of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows\n(inclusive of the impact of Tivity Health\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards) that Tivity Health was forecasted to\ngenerate during Tivity Health\u2019s fiscal years 2022 through 2032. Lazard also calculated a range of implied terminal\nvalues for Tivity Health by applying perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0%, which range was selected based on\nLazard\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows\nthat Tivity Health was forecasted to generate. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted\nto present value as of March 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 10.00% to 11.00%, derived based on a\nweighted average cost of capital calculation. Based on this range of implied enterprise values and Tivity Health\u2019s\nestimated net debt as of March 31, 2022 (calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and less the value of\nTivity Health\u2019s equity stake in Sharecare, Inc.), this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of\nTivity Health Common Stock of $26.95 to $33.90 (rounded to the nearest $0.05) compared to the Transaction\nConsideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity Health Common Stock.1\nSelected Public Company Trading Analysis\nUsing public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard compared certain financial information of Tivity\nHealth to corresponding financial information for selected publicly traded companies that, based on Lazard\u2019s\nprofessional judgment and experience, Lazard considered generally relevant for purposes of analysis. The selected\ncompanies used in this analysis were as follows:\nPayor Services\n\u2022\nModivCare Inc.\n\u2022\nMultiPlan Corporation\n\u2022\nSignify Health, Inc.\nTech-Enabled Services\n\u2022\nAllscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.\n\u2022\nConvey Health Solutions Holdings, Inc.\n\u2022\nNextgen Healthcare, Inc.\n\u2022\nPremier, Inc.\n\u2022\nSharecare, Inc.\nFollowing the oral submission of Lazard\u2019s opinion, Lazard provided the board on April 7, 2022 with a finalized presentation of its\nfinancial analyses reflecting the finalized share count per the Merger Agreement (the \u201cFinalization\u201d). The Finalization did not\nchange the conclusion of Lazard\u2019s opinion dated as of April 5, 2022. The impact of the Finalization resulted in a range of implied\nvalue per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $26.95 to $33.90 compared to the prior range of $27.05 to $34.10 for the\ndiscounted cash flow analysis, in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05.\n49\n1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\neBrokers\n\u2022\neHealth, Inc.\n\u2022\nGoHealth, Inc.\n\u2022\nSelectQuote, Inc.\nLazard selected the companies above because, among other things, the selected companies operate businesses\nsimilar in certain respects to the business of Tivity Health. However, none of the selected companies is identical to\nTivity Health and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of Tivity\nHealth. Based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard believes that purely quantitative analyses are not,\nin isolation, determinative in the context of the Transaction Consideration and that qualitative judgments concerning\ndifferences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of Tivity Health and the\nselected companies that could affect the public trading values of each company are also relevant.\nFor each of the selected companies, Lazard calculated (i) enterprise value (defined as equity market capitalization plus\ntotal debt, plus preferred equity, plus minority interest, less unconsolidated assets, less cash and cash equivalents,\nas applicable) based on closing share prices as of April 4, 2022, as a multiple of estimated Adjusted EBITDA (defined\nas estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted, as applicable, for non-recurring\nitems and any other adjustments, as appropriate) for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 and (ii) price per share as of April 4,\n2022 as a multiple of Adjusted EPS (defined as diluted income from continuing operations, net of tax, adjusted, as\napplicable, for non-recurring items and any other adjustments, as appropriate) for fiscal years 2022 and 2023.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\nBenchmark\nHigh\nLow\nMean\nMedian\n2022E Adjusted EBITDA\n20.2x\n7.8x\n12.3x\n10.8x\n2022E Adjusted EPS\n27.3x\n13.6x\n20.0x\n20.3x\n2023E Adjusted EBITDA\n12.8x\n6.7x\n10.3x\n10.5x\n2023E Adjusted EPS\n21.3x\n12.6x\n17.2x\n17.2x\nBased on the multiples derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and experience,\nLazard applied a range of multiples of enterprise value / Adjusted EBITDA of 9.0x - 11.0x to Tivity Health\u2019s estimated\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2022 and a range of 8.5x - 10.5x to Tivity Health\u2019s estimated Adjusted EBITDA for 2023. Based\non this range of implied enterprise values and Tivity Health\u2019s estimated net debt as of March 31, 2022 (calculated as\ntotal debt less cash and cash equivalents and less the value of Tivity Health\u2019s equity stake in Sharecare, Inc.), this\nanalysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $23.75 to $30.15\n(rounded to the nearest $0.05) using 2022 Adjusted EBITDA and $25.00 to $32.10 (rounded to the nearest $0.05) using\n2023 Adjusted EBITDA, in each case, as compared to the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity\nHealth Common Stock.2 In addition, based on the multiples derived for the selected companies and based on its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Lazard applied a range of multiples of price / Adjusted EPS of 15.0x - 18.0x and\n14.0x - 17.0x to Tivity Health\u2019s estimated Adjusted EPS for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, respectively. This analysis\nindicated a range of implied equity values per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $26.65 to $32.00 (rounded to\nthe nearest $0.05) and $27.50 to $33.40 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), respectively, compared to the Transaction\nConsideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity Health Common Stock.\nThe impact of the Finalization resulted in a range of implied value per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of, $23.75 - $30.15\ncompared to the prior range of $23.85 - $30.30 for Enterprise Value (\u201cEV\u201d) / 2022 Adjusted EBITDA and $25.00 - $32.10\ncompared to the prior range of $25.10 - $32.25 for EV / 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05.\n50\n2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOther Analyses\nLazard also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to its\nopinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:\nPrecedent Transactions Analysis\nLazard reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information related to the following selected transactions\ninvolving target companies in the payor services industry that Lazard believed, based on its experience and\nprofessional judgment, to be relevant in certain respects for purposes of this analysis. None of the selected\nprecedent transactions or the companies party to such transactions is directly comparable to the Merger or to Tivity\nHealth, and are included for reference only. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments\nconcerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that\ncould affect the transactions differently than they would affect the Merger. The selected reference transactions in the\npayor services industry reviewed by Lazard were as follows:\nMonth and\nYear \nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nImplied Total\nEnterprise \nValue (\u201cTEV\u201d) \n(in billions)\nTEV / LTM\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nJanuary 2021\nCentene Corporation\nMagellan Health, Inc.\n$2.1\n14.2x\nOctober 2017\nExpress Scripts Holding\nCompany\neviCore healthcare\n3.6\n12.0x\nMay 2016\nHellman & Friedman /\nLeonard Green\nMultiPlan Corporation\n7.5\n11.5x\nLazard also reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information related to the following selected\ntransactions involving target companies that were pharmacy benefit managers:\nMonth and Year \nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nImplied\nTEV\n(in\nbillions)\nTEV / LTM \nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nMarch 2018\nCigna Corporation\nExpress Scripts Holding\nCompany\n$64.9\n12.8x\nMarch 2015\nUnitedHealth Group\nIncorporation\nCatamaran Corp.\n13.3\n16.3x\nApril 2012\nSXC Health Solutions\nCatalyst Health Solutions,\nInc.\n4.4\n19.6x\nJuly 2011\nExpress Scripts Holding\nCompany\nMedco Health Solutions, Inc.\n34.6\n10.8x\nNovember 2006\nCVS Corporation\nCaremark Rx, Inc.\n25.7\n13.5x\nFor each selected transaction, Lazard calculated the transaction value (defined as the target company\u2019s implied equity\nvalue based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt, plus preferred equity, plus\nminority interest, less unconsolidated assets, less cash and cash equivalents, as applicable) as a multiple of last\ntwelve-month Adjusted EBITDA for the target company at the time of the announcement of the applicable\ntransaction (or in some cases, where last twelve-month financial information was not publicly available, as a multiple\nof current calendar year or prior calendar year Adjusted EBITDA), which Lazard refers to as \u201cLTM Adjusted\nEBITDA\u201d. Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the\ntime of announcement of each transaction. Lazard analyzed the multiples it derived from the selected payor services\ntransactions and based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard selected a reference range of transaction\nvalue to LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 11.5x to 14.2x and applied this range of multiples to Tivity Health\u2019s\nestimated LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2022. This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per\nshare of Tivity Health Common Stock of $30.65 - $38.95 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the\nTransaction Consideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity Health Common Stock.3\nThe impact of the Finalization on the precedent transaction analysis resulted in a range of implied value per share of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock of $30.65 - $38.95 compared to the prior range of $30.80 - $39.25, in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05.\n51\n3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIllustrative Leveraged Buyout Analysis\nLazard performed an illustrative leveraged buyout analysis based on the Tivity Health Projections provided by\nmanagement of Tivity Health to determine the range of price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock at which a\nfinancial buyer would be willing to pay to acquire Tivity Health on a stand-alone basis with an illustrative capital\nstructure that Lazard deemed to be achievable in the current market. For purposes of this analysis, Lazard assumed a\nrequired internal rate of return in the range of 15.0% to 25.0%, total leverage ratio of approximately 6.7x to Tivity\nHealth\u2019s estimated LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2022 and an exit multiple of 12.0x. This analysis indicated\na range of implied equity values per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $27.05 - $33.65 (rounded to the nearest\n$0.05), as compared to the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity Health Common Stock. Lazard also\napplied these calculations (using a 12.2x exit multiple in lieu of the aforementioned 12.0x exit multiple) utilizing\nselected Wall Street equity analysts\u2019 consensus estimates for Tivity Health, extrapolated through 2026 per Tivity\nHealth guidance, in lieu of the forecasts provided by Tivity Health\u2019s management. This analysis resulted in a range of\nimplied equity value per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $26.20 to $33.05 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as\ncompared to the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity Health Common Stock.4\nPremiums Paid Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, Lazard reviewed all-cash healthcare services transactions announced since\nJanuary 1, 2010 with total enterprise value over $1 billion involving either a U.S. acquiror or a U.S. target and pursuant\nto which 100% of the target\u2019s shares were acquired by the acquiror. Using publicly available information, Lazard\ncalculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in\neach such transaction exceeded (i) the closing market price per share of the target companies, (ii) the 30-day volume-\nweighted average price, (iii) the 60-day volume-weighted average price, (iv) the 90-day volume-weighted average\nprice and (v) the 52-week high as of the last unaffected date prior to announcement of each transaction.\nThis analysis indicated the following\nO n e\nDay \nPrior\n30-\nDay \nVWAP\n60-\nDay \nVWAP\n90-\nDay \nVWAP\n52-\nWeek \nHigh\n75th Percentile\n33%\n38%\n35%\n39%\n20%\nMean\n27%\n29%\n31%\n32%\n8%\nMedian\n27%\n27%\n28%\n29%\n10%\n25th Percentile\n17%\n21%\n21%\n22%\n(1%)\nThe impact of the Finalization on the leveraged buyout analysis resulted in a range of implied value per share of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock of $27.05 - $33.65 compared to the prior range of $27.10 - $33.75 for the Tivity Health Projections and $26.20 -\n$33.05 compared to the prior range of $26.20 - $33.10 for the Wall Street equity analysts\u2019 consensus estimates for Tivity Health,\nas extrapolated, in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05.\n52\n4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Lazard applied (i) a one-day\npremium range of 17% to 33%, (ii) a 30-Day volume-weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) premium range of 21%-38%,\n(iii) a 60-Day VWAP premium range of 21% to 35%, (iv) a 90-Day VWAP premium range of 22% to 39% and (v) a 52-\nWeek High premium range of (1%) to 20% to the analysis. The one-day premium was applied to (1) the $32.25 closing\nprice per share of Tivity Health Common Stock as of April 4, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the public\nannouncement of a proposal from Stone Point Capital to acquire Tivity Health for $32.50 per share, (2) the $27.28\nclosing price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock as of February 28, 2022, the last full trading day prior to Stone\nPoint Capital\u2019s outreach to potential debt financing sources, (3) the $24.81 closing price per share of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock as of January 7, 2022, the last full trading day prior to Lazard\u2019s outreach to other counterparties, and\n(4) the $25.36 closing price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock as of December 7, 2021, the last full trading day\nprior to Stone Point Capital\u2019s initial proposal to acquire Tivity Health for $33.00 per share.

Public market\ntrading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for\nthe shares of Tivity Health Common Stock and these target prices and the analysts\u2019 earnings estimates on which they\nwere based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors affecting the financial performance of Tivity Health\nand future general industry and market conditions.\nMiscellaneous\nIn connection with Lazard\u2019s services as a financial advisor to the Board, Tivity Health agreed to pay Lazard an\naggregate fee of approximately $24.5 million, $2.5 million of which was payable upon the rendering of Lazard\u2019s opinion\nand the remainder of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Tivity Health has\nagreed to reimburse certain of Lazard\u2019s expenses arising, and to indemnify Lazard against certain liabilities that may\narise, out of Lazard\u2019s engagement.\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLazard, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their\nsecurities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed\nand unlisted securities, private placements, leveraged buyouts, and valuations for estate, corporate and other\npurposes. In the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard\u2019s opinion, Lazard has provided certain investment\nbanking services to Tivity Health, for which Lazard received compensation of approximately $9 million, including\nhaving been engaged by Tivity Health to advise on Tivity Health\u2019s disposition of Nutrisystem, Inc. In addition,\nLazard has in the past provided, is currently providing, and may in the future provide certain investment banking\nservices to Parent and/or certain of its affiliates for which Lazard has received and may receive compensation,\nincluding, during the past two years, having been engaged with respect to certain fund raising matters. The\naggregate amount of fees paid to Lazard for financial advisory services to Stone Point Capital and its known affiliates\nin the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard\u2019s opinion was less than $1 million. In addition, in the ordinary\ncourse, Lazard and its affiliates and employees may trade securities of Tivity Health and certain of its affiliates as well\nas certain affiliates of Stone Point Capital for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers and,\naccordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, and may also trade and hold securities\non behalf of Tivity Health, Stone Point Capital and certain of their respective affiliates. The issuance of Lazard\u2019s\nopinion was approved by the opinion committee of Lazard.\nLazard is an internationally recognized investment banking firm providing a full range of financial advisory and other\nservices.

The Tivity Health Projections were used by Lazard for purposes\nof preparing its financial analyses and fairness opinion provided to the Board on April 5, 2022 in connection with its\nconsideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger, as described in the section entitled \u201cOpinion of Tivity\nHealth\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 46 of this Proxy Statement. In addition, the Tivity Health Projections\nwere made available to potential counterparties to a strategic transaction, including Stone Point Capital, in\nconnection with their due diligence review of a potential transaction. The Tivity Health Projections were prepared in\nJanuary 2022, treating Tivity Health on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to, and as if Tivity Health never\ncontemplated, the Merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the Merger Agreement, the expenses that\nmay be incurred in connection with consummating the Merger, the effect of any business or strategic decision or\naction that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed or the effect of any\nbusiness or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been taken if the Merger Agreement had not been\nexecuted but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the Merger.\nThe Tivity Health Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and the summary thereof is\nincluded in this Proxy Statement only because such information was made available to the Board in connection with\nits review of strategic alternatives, and, in the case of the 2022 through 2027 forecasts, to potential counterparties to a\nstrategic transaction, including Stone Point Capital, in connection with their due diligence review of a potential\ntransaction, and to Lazard for purposes of preparing its financial analyses and fairness opinion provided to the Board\non April 5, 2022 in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger, as described in\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Opinion of Tivity Health\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 46 of this Proxy\nStatement. The summary of the Tivity Health Projections is not being included in this Proxy Statement to influence\nyour decision whether to vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Tivity Health Projections were\nnot prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines established by the SEC or the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information, or\nGAAP (and the Tivity Health Projections do\n54TABLE OF CONTENTS\nnot include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP). Neither PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Tivity Health\u2019s\nindependent registered public accounting firm (\u201cPwC\u201d), nor any other audit firm has audited, reviewed, examined,\ncompiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the Tivity Health Projections and, accordingly, PwC\nhas not expressed an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PwC report included in Tivity\nHealth\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is incorporated by reference into\nthis Proxy Statement, relates to Tivity Health\u2019s historical financial information and does not extend to the Tivity\nHealth Projections and should not be read to do so.\nThe Tivity Health Projections are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to\ninterpretation. While presented with numerical specificity, the Tivity Health Projections are based upon a variety of\nestimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by Tivity Health management\nas of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of\nreasons, including general economic conditions, competition and the risks discussed in this Proxy Statement under\nthe section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 25 of this\nProxy Statement. The Tivity Health Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are\nsubject to change. There can be no assurance that the projections contained in the Tivity Health Projections will be\nrealized, and actual results may differ materially from those shown therein. Generally, the further out the period to\nwhich Tivity Health Projections relate, the more unreliable the information becomes.\nThe information in the Tivity Health Projections is not factual and should not be relied upon as being necessarily\nindicative of future results, and Tivity Health\u2019s stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Tivity\nHealth Projections. The Tivity Health Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical\nfinancial statements and other information regarding Tivity Health contained in Tivity Health\u2019s public filings with the\nSEC.\nThis Proxy Statement contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA (which means\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted, as applicable, for non-recurring items and any\nother adjustments, as appropriate) and Unlevered Free Cash Flow (\u201cUnlevered FCF\u201d), which means Adjusted\nEBITDA less cash taxes, less capitalized expenditures, less changes in working capital items. Tivity Health believes\nthat its presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and\nmanagement regarding Tivity Health\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Other firms may calculate non-\nGAAP measures differently than Tivity Health, which limits comparability between companies. Non-GAAP measures\nare not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP.\nNone of Tivity Health, Lazard or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives can\nprovide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Tivity Health Projections, and none of them\nundertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Tivity Health Projections to reflect\ncircumstances existing after the date the Tivity Health Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of\nfuture events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Tivity Health Projections, as\napplicable, are shown to be in error. Since the date of the Tivity Health Projections, Tivity Health has made publicly\navailable its actual results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and the quarter ended March 31,\n2022. You should review Tivity\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with\nthe SEC on February 25, 2022, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2022 for this information.

None of Tivity Health, Lazard or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers,\ndirectors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any Tivity Health stockholder or any\nother person (including Stone Point Capital, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise) regarding the Tivity Health\nProjections, Tivity Health\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Tivity Health\nProjections or that forecasted results will be achieved.\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table presents a summary of the Tivity Health Projections:\nForecast\nExtrapolations\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\n2028E\n2029E\n2030E\n2031E\n2032E\n(dollars in millions)\nRevenue\n$587\n$727\n$846\n$952\n$1,062\n$1,124\n$1,205\n$1,280\n$1,347\n$1,403\n$1,448\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$165\n$183\n$201\n$219\n$241\n$255\n$273\n$290\n$305\n$318\n$328\nUnlevered FCF(2)\n$108\n$110\n$117\n$125\n$138\n$149\n$160\n$170\n$179\n$186\n$192\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted, as applicable, for non-\nrecurring items and any other adjustments, as appropriate.\n(2)\nIncludes cash impact of net operating losses.

The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other\nmatters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that Tivity Health stockholders\napprove the adoption of the Merger Agreement. For purposes of the discussion below, Tivity Health\u2019s executive\nofficers (each of whom is a named executive officer) are Richard M. Ashworth (Chief Executive Officer), Adam C.\nHolland (Chief Financial Officer), Ryan M. Wagers (Chief Accounting Officer), Thomas E. Lewis (Chief Operating\nOfficer), and J. Raymond Bilbao (Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary) (each, a \u201cNEO\u201d). These interests are\ndescribed below.\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in\nthis section, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe Effective Time is May 18, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for\npurposes of the disclosure in this section (the \u201cChange in Control Date\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nThe employment of each executive officer of Tivity Health is assumed to be terminated by Tivity Health\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or due to the executive officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined\nin the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Change in Control Date\u037e\n\u2022\nThe potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a \u201ccutback\u201d to\navoid the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\nA price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $32.50, which is equal to the Transaction Consideration\npayable in the Merger.\nAs the amounts provided below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or\nbe accurate as of the date referenced, the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become payable may materially\ndiffer from the amounts set forth below.\nTreatment and Quantification of Tivity Health Equity Awards\nTreatment of Company Options\nEach Company Option, whether or not vested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be\ncancelled and will entitle the holder, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and\n(ii) the Surviving Corporation\u2019s first payroll date after the Effective Time, to receive an amount in cash (without\ninterest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the\nnumber of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such Company\n56TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOption as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Transaction Consideration over\nthe exercise price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior\nto the Effective Time. If the exercise price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of a Company Option is equal to\nor greater than the Transaction Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger\nwithout any action on the part of, and without any payment to, the Company Option holder.\nTreatment of Company MSUs\nEach Company MSU award outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (which, as of the date of this\nProxy Statement, consists only of Company MSU awards held by Mr. Ashworth) will automatically become vested,\nwill be cancelled without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof, and will entitle the holder to\nreceive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving\nCorporation\u2019s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable\nwithholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock that would have vested pursuant to the terms of such Company MSU award based on actual\nperformance through the Effective Time, and (B) the Transaction Consideration. To the extent that any Company\nMSU award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, however, such\ncash payment will be paid in accordance with the Company MSU award\u2019s terms and at the earliest time permitted\nunder the terms of such award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the\nCode.\nTreatment of Company RSUs\nExcept as described below for Company RSU awards granted after April 5, 2022, each Company RSU award\noutstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically become fully vested, will be cancelled and\nwill entitle the holder to receive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and (ii)\nthe Surviving Corporation\u2019s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest and subject\nto applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of\nTivity Health Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time\nand (B) the Transaction Consideration. To the extent a Company RSU award constitutes nonqualified deferred\ncompensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, however, such cash payment will be paid in accordance with the\nCompany RSU award\u2019s terms and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in\nthe application of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code.\nTreatment of Company RSUs Granted After April 5, 2022\nIf the Merger is completed, except for (i) deferred Company RSUs granted to certain non-employee directors under\nTivity Health\u2019s Director Deferred Compensation Program and (ii) limited exceptions for certain Company RSUs (that\nare not applicable to any of Tivity Health\u2019s NEOs or non-employee directors), which, in each case, will vest in full\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU award granted after April 5, 2022, will vest immediately\nprior to the Effective Time on a prorated basis, with such proration based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the\nnumber of days of continuous service provided by the grantee to Tivity Health between the grant date of the\nCompany RSU award and the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is 1,096, and otherwise will be treated in\naccordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as described above. The portion of any such Company RSU\naward granted after April 5, 2022 that does not vest in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence will be\nforfeited without consideration upon the Effective Time without any action on the part of the holder of any such\nCompany RSU award.

Although Peter Hudson, M.D. and Benjamin Kirshner are considered directors for purposes\nof this disclosure, both Dr. Hudson and Mr. Kirshner departed the Board on May 20, 2021, do not hold any unvested\nCompany RSUs and do not otherwise have any interests in the Merger except insofar as they may hold shares of\nTivity Health Common Stock.\nAgreements with Tivity Health Named Executive Officers\nMessrs.

Holland, Bilbao, Lewis, and Wagers).\nThe provision of payments and benefits described above are generally conditioned upon the executive officer\u2019s\nexecution of a release of claims against Tivity Health.\nSection 16 Officer Separation Benefits Program\nIn September 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted a separation benefits program (the\n\u201cSeparation Benefits Program\u201d) applicable to Tivity Health\u2019s Section 16 officers, which includes each of its named\nexecutive officers. However, Tivity Health\u2019s Section 16 Officers are not entitled to participate in the Separation\nBenefits Program to the extent they are entitled to any severance payments or benefits from another program or\nagreement with Tivity Health (for example, an employment agreement or severance agreement) that provides greater\nseverance payments or more favorable terms than the Separation Benefits Program. Currently, Mr. Bilbao is the only\nNEO entitled to participate in the Separation Benefits Program because the Bilbao Change of Control Agreement with\nthe Company provides for less favorable severance payments than would be payable to him under the Separation\nBenefits Program. If the employment of Mr. Bilbao is terminated by Tivity Health without \u201cCause\u201d or by Mr. Bilbao for\n\u201cGood Reason\u201d (each, as defined in the Separation Benefits Program) within 12 months following a change in control,\nhe would be entitled to the following payments:\n\u2022\nA severance payment in the form of salary continuation for 52 weeks after the date of termination\u037e\n\u2022\nThree months of outplacement services\u037e and\n\u2022\nA subsidy such that Mr. Bilbao\u2019s portion of the COBRA premiums for 52 weeks after the date of termination\nwill approximate the regular colleague contribution for the coverages elected by Mr. Bilbao.\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor additional detail, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of\nTivity Health in the Merger-Quantification of Payments and Benefits\u201d beginning on page 60 of this Proxy Statement.\nThe provision of payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon Mr. Bilbao\u2019s timely execution (without\nrevocation) of a separation agreement and general release of liability against Tivity Health.\nCompensation Arrangements with Parent\nAs of the date of this Proxy Statement, none of Tivity Health\u2019s executive officers or non-employee directors have\ndiscussed or entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to\npurchase or participate in the equity plans or arrangements of, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of\ntheir affiliates. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, however, some or all of Tivity Health\u2019s executive\nofficers and non-employee directors may discuss or enter into agreements with Parent regarding employment with, or\nthe right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates (including the Surviving\nCorporation).\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, the table below sets forth the\ncompensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger that will or may become payable to each named\nexecutive officer of Tivity Health in connection with the Merger.

In the case of 50% of Mr. Ashworth\u2019s Special Incentive Bonus Award (i.e.,\n$2,500,000), such amount constitutes a \u201csingle-trigger\u201d payment, which means that the amount is payable upon consummation\nof the Merger notwithstanding whether Mr. Ashworth incurs a termination of employment.

            "text": "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock whose shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to\nthe Merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations promulgated under\nthe Code (the \u201cTreasury Regulations\u201d), court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this Proxy Statement\n63TABLE OF CONTENTS\nand all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is\nlimited to holders who hold their shares of Tivity Health Common Stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of\nSection 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). For purposes of this discussion, a\n\u201cholder\u201d means either a U.S. Holder (as defined below) or a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below) or both, as the\ncontext may require.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may\nbe relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances, nor does it address any consequences to holders\nsubject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as tax-exempt entities, S corporations,\npartnerships (including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and\npartners therein, financial institutions, insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities who elect to\napply a mark-to-market method of accounting, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, persons\nwho are subject to the alternative minimum tax, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States,\npersons who actually or constructively own 5% of more of Tivity Health Common Stock, persons who acquire their\nshares of Tivity Health Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as\ncompensation, persons who hold their shares of Tivity Health Common Stock as part of a straddle, hedge,\nconversion, constructive sale, synthetic security, integrated investment or other risk-reduction transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, and persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This discussion does not\naddress any U.S. federal estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences or any state, local or non-U.S. tax\nconsequences, or the consequences of the Medicare tax on net investment income. If a partnership (including an\nentity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of\nTivity Health Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status\nof the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock and\npartners therein should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger to their particular\ncircumstances.\nNo ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger\ndescribed herein. This summary is not binding on the IRS or a court, and there can be no assurance that the tax\nconsequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or that they would be sustained by a\ncourt if so challenged.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT\nTHEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING\nTO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES\nARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock who\nis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of\none or more United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid\nelection in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person as defined\nin section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Tivity Health Common Stock pursuant to the Merger\nwill be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or\nloss as a result of such exchange. In general, a U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to\nthe Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that the U.S. Holder paid for the\nshares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor loss if the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock is more than one year at the\ntime of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder are subject to preferential income tax rates.\nThe deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock who is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSpecial rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment, such as\n\u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d or \u201cpassive foreign investment companies.\u201d Non-U.S. Holders should consult their\ntax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences that may be relevant to them in\nlight of their particular circumstances.\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States\n(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained\nby such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax at rates generally applicable to a U.S. Holder, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation,\nsuch gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an\napplicable tax treaty)\u037e or\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty).\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a\nholder of Tivity Health Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (i) a\nU.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject\nto backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder that provides a\ncertification of such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or\nsuccessor form) or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit\nagainst the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the\nIRS.\nHolders of Tivity Health Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of\nthe Merger to their particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of any state, local, foreign or\nother tax laws.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

Tivity Health, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-03832 (referred to as the\n\u201cStein Complaint\u201d), naming as defendants Tivity Health and each member of the Board. On May 20, 2022, a purported\nstockholder of Tivity Health filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,\ncaptioned Hopkins v. Tivity Health, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-02992 (referred to as the \u201cHopkins Complaint\u201d, and,\ncollectively with the Stein Complaint, the \u201cComplaints\u201d), naming as defendants Tivity Health and each member of the\nBoard.\nThe Complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Specifically, the Complaints allege that the preliminary\nproxy statement filed by Tivity Health with the SEC on May 10, 2022 in connection with the Merger contains\nmaterially incomplete and misleading information concerning the Company\u2019s financial projections and the financial\nanalyses conducted by Lazard in support of its fairness opinion. The relief sought in the Complaints includes\nenjoining the consummation and closing of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly\nmaterial information\u037e rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the terms\nthereof\u037e granting rescissory damages\u037e directing the defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result\nof the defendants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing\u037e and awarding the plaintiffs\u2019 costs and disbursements, including reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.\nTivity Health believes that the claims asserted in the Complaints are without merit and Tivity Health and the\nindividual defendants intend to defend against the Complaints\u037e however, Tivity Health cannot predict the amount of\ntime and expense that will be required to resolve either or both of the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.\nAdditional lawsuits may be filed against Tivity Health or its directors and officers in connection with the Merger. The\noutcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or delay\nconsummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Tivity Health, including any costs associated with the\nindemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no order,\njudgment, or injunction, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, by any court or other tribunal of competent\njurisdiction has been entered and continues to be in effect, and no law has been adopted or is effective, in each case\nthat restrains, enjoins, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff\nwere successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms,\nthen such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated within the expected time frame, or at all.\nTERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT",

            "text": "Adjournment Proposal\nTivity Health stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal providing for one or more adjournments of the\nSpecial Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Board, including to solicit additional\nproxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement or to seek a\nquorum if one is not initially obtained. If this proposal is approved, the Special Meeting could be successively\nadjourned to another time and place. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Tivity Health may adjourn, delay or\npostpone the Special Meeting (1) with the consent of Parent, (2) if, as of the time the Special Meeting is scheduled,\nthere are insufficient shares of Tivity Health Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a\nquorum necessary to do business at the Special Meeting, (3) if, as of the time of the Special Meeting is scheduled,\nthere are insufficient shares of Tivity Health Common Stock with respect to which proxies have been submitted to\napprove the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (4) if the Board determines in its good faith judgment that failure to\nadjourn, delay or postpone the Special Meeting would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law,\nor (5) if the Board determines in its good faith judgment that such adjournment, delay or postponement is necessary\nfor the filing and mailing of any supplemental or additional disclosure reasonably likely to be necessary or\nappropriate under applicable law to be disseminated to and reviewed by Tivity Health stockholders prior to the\nSpecial Meeting. If the Special Meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, shareholders\nwho have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. In addition, the\nBoard may postpone the Special Meeting before it commences in accordance with Tivity\u2019s Health\u2019s bylaws.\nThe vote on the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary\nor appropriate, is a vote separate and apart from the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Tivity Health does not\nanticipate calling a vote on this proposal if the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by the requisite\nnumber of shares at the Special Meeting.\nVote Required and Board Recommendation\nApproval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary\nor appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the Tivity Health Common\nStock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting, provided a quorum\nis present. The failure of any stockholder of record to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone,\nsubmit a signed proxy card, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to\napprove one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate. Abstentions\nwill be counted as votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal. Because the proposals presented to stockholders will be\nconsidered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will\nnot be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special\nMeeting, and otherwise will have no effect on the adjournment proposal.\nThe Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the\nSpecial Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are\ninsufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is\nnot initially obtained, if a vote on such proposal is called.\n92TABLE OF CONTENTS\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT",

            "text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS\nIf the Merger is consummated, shares of Tivity Health Common Stock held by Tivity Health stockholders who do not\nvote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously hold of record their shares of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock through the Effective Time of the Merger, who properly demand appraisal of their shares (and who do\nnot withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights), and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262\nof the DGCL shall not be converted into the right to receive Transaction Consideration, but the holders of such\nDissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of\nthe DGCL.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is\nqualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex C and\nincorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not\nconstitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of\nrecord of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that\nholder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Tivity Health Common Stock held of record in the\nname of another person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to\nfollow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your\nshares of Tivity Health Common Stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal\nrights, you should consult with your broker, bank or the other nominee. Unless context requires otherwise, all\nreferences in this section to a \u201cstockholder\u201d or a \u201cholder\u201d are to a record holder of Tivity Health Common Stock.\nUnder Section 262, holders of Tivity Health Common Stock who (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of such\nholder\u2019s shares of Tivity Health Common Stock to Tivity Health before the taking of the stockholder vote on the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,\n(iii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time, and (iv) otherwise follow the\nprocedures set forth in Section 262, will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and to\nreceive in lieu of the Transaction Consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery\nto be the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount determined to\nbe fair value as determined by the Court of Chancery (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash\npayments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262). Unless the Court of\nChancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue\nand compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period\u037e\nprovided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving\nCorporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case, such interest will accrue\nafter the time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery and (2) any interest\naccrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no\nobligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders considering seeking\nappraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more\nthan, the same as or less than the $32.50 per share Transaction Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal\nrights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This Proxy Statement\nconstitutes Tivity Health\u2019s notice to Tivity Health stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with\nthe Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex C. In connection with the\nthe Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex C. In connection with the\nMerger, any holder of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes\nto preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the\nrequirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nIn addition, the Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Tivity Health stockholders who assert\nappraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds one\npercent of the outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock measured in\n95TABLE OF CONTENTS\naccordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (ii) the value of the aggregate Transaction\nConsideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. Because of the complexity of the procedures for\nexercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, Tivity Health believes that if a Tivity\nHealth stockholder is considering exercising appraisal rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal\ncounsel. A stockholder who loses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Transaction\nConsideration as described in the Merger Agreement.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Tivity Health Common Stock must\nfully comply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Tivity Health a written demand for appraisal before the vote on proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the\nEffective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the\nEffective Time).\nIf a stockholder submits the form of proxy solicited by Tivity Health, and the stockholder does not provide voting\ninstructions, the proxy will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nAccordingly, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should not return a blank\nproxy, but rather must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.",

A holder of shares of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal\nis made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. Neither voting (in person or by\nproxy) against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the\nrequirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or\nvote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand before the\ntaking of the stockholder vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting will cause the\nstockholder to lose its appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares\nregistered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock should\nbe executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Tivity Health of the identity of the\nholder and state that the stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with\nthe Merger. If the shares are owned of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, fiduciary, depository or\nother nominee, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of\nrecord by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by\nor on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may\nexecute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or\nowners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or\nowners. If a stockholder holds shares of Tivity Health Common Stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares\nthrough a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be\nmade by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE\nFORMS, AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BROKERS,\nBANKS AND OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR\nTHE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE\nSHARES.

The\nCourt of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock\ncertificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any\nstockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such\nstockholder.",

        "Determination of Fair Value": {
            "text": "Determination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery will\nappraise the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from\nthe accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount\ndetermined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery of will take into account all relevant\nfactors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which\nare generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts\nthat could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware\nstated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which\nrather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In\nWeinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,\nmay be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by\nthe Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to\nthe Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the\nfairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and may not\nin any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Tivity Health believes that the\nTransaction Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a\ndetermination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Transaction Consideration. Neither Tivity Health\nnor Parent anticipates offering more than the $32.50 per share Transaction Consideration to any Tivity Health\nstockholder exercising appraisal rights. Each of Tivity Health and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Tivity Health Common Stock is less than\nthe $32.50 per share Transaction Consideration.\nUnless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective\nTime through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between\nthe Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the Surviving Corporation may, at any time\nbefore the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that\nequals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as\ndetermined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless\npaid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to\nsuch entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and\nexpenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of\nChancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may\nalso order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,\nincluding, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata\nagainst the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each\nparty bears its own expense.\n98TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Tivity Health Common Stock under Section 262\nfails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of Tivity\nHealth Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the Transaction\nConsideration, less applicable withholding taxes.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Tivity\nHealth Common Stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except\ndividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, if any, payable to Tivity\nHealth stockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Tivity Health stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is\nencouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\n99\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOTHER MATTERS",

However, if the Merger is not\ncompleted, Tivity Health stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in Tivity Health\u2019s annual\nmeeting of stockholders, and Tivity Health will hold the 2022 Annual Meeting, in which case Tivity Health will\nprovide notice of or otherwise publicly disclose the date on which the 2022 Annual Meeting will be held. If the 2022\nAnnual Meeting is held, stockholder proposals will be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the proxy statement\nand form of proxy for consideration at the 2022 Annual Meeting (\u201c2022 Annual Proxy Statement\u201d) in accordance with\nRule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and Tivity Health\u2019s bylaws, as described below.\nStockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in the 2022 Annual Proxy Statement by submitting their\nproposals in writing to Tivity Health in a timely manner. As described in Tivity Health\u2019s annual proxy statement for\nthe 2021 annual meeting of stockholders filed on April 6, 2021, Tivity Health stockholders had the opportunity to\nsubmit proper proposals for inclusion in the 2022 Annual Proxy Statement and for consideration at the 2022 Annual\nMeeting by submitting their proposals to Tivity Health\u2019s Secretary at 701 Cool Springs Blvd., Franklin, Tennessee,\n37067 before the close of business on December 7, 2021 and otherwise complying with the requirements of Rule 14a-8\nof the Exchange Act. However, if the 2022 Annual Meeting is held and the date of the 2022 Annual Meeting is more\nthan 30 days after May 20, 2022, then the deadline will be a reasonable time before Tivity Health begins to print and\nsend its proxy materials for the 2022 Annual Meeting.\nNotices of stockholders\u2019 proposals (including nominations) submitted outside the processes of Rule 14a-8 will be\nconsidered timely (but not considered for inclusion in the 2022 Annual Proxy Statement), pursuant to the advance\nnotice requirement set forth in Tivity Health\u2019s bylaws, if such notices were filed with Tivity Health\u2019s Secretary not\nless than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the prior year\u2019s annual meeting of\nstockholders (i.e., not earlier than January 20, 2022 and not later than February 19, 2022). However, in the event that\nthe 2022 Annual Meeting is held and the date of such meeting is delayed by more than 60 days from May 20, 2022,\nnotice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual\nmeeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th\nday following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.\nHOUSEHOLDING INFORMATION",

The name of its registered agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.\nARTICLE THREE\nThe purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized\nunder the General Corporation Law of Delaware.\nARTICLE FOUR\nThe total number of shares which the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is one hundred (100) shares, all of\nwhich shall be shares of Common Stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share.\nARTICLE FIVE\nThe directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws, except as may be otherwise be provided in the\nBylaws.\nARTICLE SIX\nThe Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of\nDelaware.\nARTICLE SEVEN\nSection 1.\u2003Nature of Indemnity. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is\ninvolved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a\n\u201cproceeding\u201d), by reason of the fact that he (or a person of whom he is the legal representative), is or was a director\nor officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee,\nfiduciary, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service\nwith respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity\nas a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer,\nemployee, fiduciary or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent which it\nis empowered to do so by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter\nbe amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the\nCorporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to\nsuch amendment) against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys\u2019 fees actually and reasonably incurred by\nsuch person in connection with such proceeding and such indemnification shall inure to the benefit of his or her\nheirs, executors and administrators\u037e provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article Seven, the\nCorporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding initiated by\nsuch person only if such proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to\nindemnification conferred in this Article Seven shall be a contract right and, subject to Sections 2 and 5 of this Article\nSeven, shall include the\nA-68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nright to payment by the Corporation of the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its\nfinal disposition. The Corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and\nagents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.\nSection 2.\u2003Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Any indemnification of a director or officer of the\nCorporation under Section 1 of this Article Seven or advance of expenses under Section 5 of this Article Seven shall\nbe made promptly, and in any event within 30 days, upon the written request of the director or officer. If a\ndetermination by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article\nSeven is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written request for indemnity, the\nCorporation shall be deemed to have approved the request. If the Corporation denies a written request for\nindemnification or advancing of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not\nmade within 30 days, the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article Seven shall be enforceable\nby the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person\u2019s costs and expenses incurred in\nconnection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall\nalso be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to\nenforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the\nrequired undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of\nconduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to\nindemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither\nthe failure of the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to\nhave made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in\nthe circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation\nLaw of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,\nindependent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct,\nshall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of\nconduct.\nSection 3.\u2003Nonexclusively of Article Seven. The rights to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in\ndefending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article Seven shall not be exclusive of\nany other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of\nincorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.\nSection 4.\u2003Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any\nperson who is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of the Corporation or was serving at the request\nof the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or\nother enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity,\nwhether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this\nArticle Seven.\nSection 5.\u2003Expenses. Expenses incurred by any person described in Section 1 of this Article Seven in defending a\nproceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of such proceeding\u2019s final disposition unless otherwise\ndetermined by the Board of Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the\ndirector or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by\nthe Corporation. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and\nconditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.\nSection 6.\u2003Employees and Agents. Persons who are not covered by the foregoing provisions of this Article Seven\nand who are or were employees or agents of the Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the\nCorporation as employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, may\nbe indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or from time to time by the Board of Directors.\nSection 7.\u2003Contract Rights. The provisions of this Article Seven shall be deemed to be a contract right between the\nCorporation and each director or officer who serves in any such capacity at any time while this Article Seven and the\nrelevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or other applicable law are in effect, and\nany repeal or modification of this Article Seven or any such law shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing\nwith respect to any state of facts or proceeding then existing.\nA-69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSection 8.\u2003Merger or Consolidation.
