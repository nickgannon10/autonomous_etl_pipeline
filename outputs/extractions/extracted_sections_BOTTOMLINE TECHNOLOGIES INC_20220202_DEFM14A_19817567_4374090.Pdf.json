Due to the complexity of the appraisal process,\nstockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more than,\nthe same as or less than the Per Share Merger Consideration.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Bottomline a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose\nappraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair\nvalue of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no\nintention of doing so.\nYour failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The Section 262 requirements for\nexercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and Section 262 is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement. If you\nhold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank,\nbroker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other\nnominee.\nFor more information, please see the section captioned \u201cThe Merger \u2014 Appraisal Rights,\u201d beginning on page 64 of this proxy statement.",

If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by Bottomline\u2019s\nstockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into\nBottomline, with Bottomline continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Bottomline will become a wholly owned subsidiary of\nParent, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ.

If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your\nbank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a\nquorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are\ninsufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation\nthat will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA: Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present\nin person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card\u037e (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone\u037e or (3) vote in\nperson by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote,\ncompensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you hold your shares in\n\u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal\nand the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers\nin connection with the Merger. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the adjournment proposal and the proposal to approve, by\nnon-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA: SEC rules require Bottomline to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its\nnamed executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat is the compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger for\npurposes of this advisory vote?\nA: The compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is described more\nfully under the heading \u201cGolden Parachute Compensation\u201d beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers\nin connection with the Merger at the Special Meeting?\nA: Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is not a\ncondition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive\nofficers in connection with the Merger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Bottomline or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is adopted by the\nstockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection\nwith the Merger will or may be paid to Bottomline\u2019s named executive officers pursuant to the terms of the applicable arrangement even if stockholders fail\nto approve such compensation.\n16\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to\nthose shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Bottomline.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet\nname.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those\nshares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares\nby following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting.

The written document describing\nthe matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your\nshares of common stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d Our Board of Directors has designated Joseph L.

Bruce Bowden, our Chief Financial Officer, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as the proxy\nholders for the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or\ntelephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none\nof the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your\nshares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to\nadopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation\nthat will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction\ncards.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption \u201cThe Merger \u2014 U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger\u201d) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Bottomline common stock for cash\nin the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.\nYou should consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you in light of your own particular\ncircumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of certain U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided under the caption \u201cThe Merger \u2014 U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat will the holders of Bottomline stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards receive in the Merger?\nA: At the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option, restricted stock award and restricted stock unit award will be credited with the Additional\nVesting Credit. For any award of restricted shares or restricted stock units that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the number of shares\nsubject to such award will be deemed to have been achieved at the \u201ctarget\u201d level of performance for such award at the Effective Time.\nAfter giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit, each outstanding option that is vested will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an\namount in cash (subject to any applicable tax withholding) equal to the product of (1) the amount, if any, by which $57.00 exceeds the exercise price per\nshare of Bottomline common stock underlying such stock option\u037e and (2) the total number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such option.\nIt is anticipated that all outstanding stock options will be fully vested and \u201cin-the-money\u201d at the Effective Time.\nAt the Effective Time, each restricted stock award that is then vested (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit) will be converted into the right\nto receive the product of (1) $57.00 and (2) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such restricted stock award, payable promptly\nfollowing the Effective Time. Each restricted stock award which is unvested as of the Effective Time (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit)\nwill be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) $57.00 and (2) the number of\nshares of Bottomline common stock subject to such unvested restricted stock award, which amount will, generally subject to the holder\u2019s continued\nservice with the Company, Parent or an affiliate through the applicable vesting date and vest and be payable at the same time and on the same terms as\nthe unvested restricted stock award to which such cash amount relates would have vested pursuant to its terms (except that any applicable performance\nconditions will be deemed to have been achieved at target levels and after giving effect to Additional Vesting Credit). Additionally, under Bottomline\u2019s\n2019 Stock Incentive Plan, if the holder\u2019s employment is terminated other than for cause or by the holder for good reason within two years of the Effective\nTime, the cash amount to which such restricted stock award relates will immediately vest.\nAt the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award that is then vested (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit) will be\nconverted into the right to receive a payment equal to the product of (1) $57.00 and (2) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such\nrestricted stock unit award, payable promptly following the Effective Time. Each restricted stock unit award that is unvested as of the Effective Time (after\ngiving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit) will be cancelled at the Effective Time and\n19\nTable of Contents\nconverted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) $57.00 and (2) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject\nto such unvested restricted stock award, which amount will, generally subject to the holder\u2019s continued service with the Company, Parent or an affiliate\nthrough the applicable vesting date and vest and be payable at the same time and on the same terms as the unvested restricted stock unit award to which\nsuch cash amount relates would have vested pursuant to its terms (except that any applicable performance conditions will be deemed to have been\nachieved at target levels and after giving effect to Additional Vesting Credit). Additionally, under Bottomline\u2019s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, if the holder\u2019s\nemployment is terminated other than for cause or by the holder for good reason within two years of the Effective Time, the cash amount to which such\nrestricted stock unit award relates will immediately vest.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to the Bottomline Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d) in connection with the Merger?\nA: The current purchase period under the ESPP will be the final purchase period under the ESPP\u037e to the extent necessary, the current purchase period will\nbe shortened so that the share purchase pursuant to that purchase period will occur prior to the Merger. Any funds remaining in a participant\u2019s account\nfollowing this final purchase will be refunded to the participant. Shares purchased via the ESPP will be treated in the same manner as other outstanding\nBottomline shares in the Merger. There will be no increase in the amount of participants\u2019 payroll deduction elections under the ESPP during the current\npurchase period and no new participants will be allowed to enroll in the ESPP.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the second calendar quarter of\n2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the\nMerger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?\nA: If the Merger is completed, Bottomline stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand\nappraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262. This means that stockholders are entitled to\nhave their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of common stock,\nexclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount\ndetermined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court, so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262. Due to the\ncomplexity of the appraisal process, Bottomline stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal\ncounsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this\nproxy statement, and Section 262 regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement.\nQ:\nDo any of Bottomline\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of Bottomline stockholders generally?\nA: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware\nthat our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Bottomline\nstockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger\u037e and (iii)\nrecommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Bottomline\u2019s stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests\nto the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger \u2014\nInterests of Bottomline\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 55 of this proxy statement.\n20\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWho can help answer my questions?\nA: If you have any questions concerning the Merger, the Special Meeting or this proxy statement, would like additional copies of this proxy statement or\nneed help voting your shares of Bottomline common stock, please contact our Proxy Solicitor:\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\nStockholders May Call Toll-Free: (877) 687-1865\nBanks & Brokers May Call Collect: (212) 750-5833\n21\nTable of Contents\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",

In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial\nperformance and financial condition, and often contain words such as \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d\n\u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201cpotentially,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other\ncomparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the\nconsummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements, including the failure to\nconsummate the proposed transaction or to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate the transaction on a timely matter or at all, are\nnot guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nexpressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from\nthose indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying\non forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the proposed\ntransaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining stockholder and regulatory approvals, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities,\nfuture capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects,\nbusiness and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Bottomline\u2019s business and other conditions to the completion of the\ntransaction\u037e (ii) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bottomline\u2019s business and general economic conditions\u037e (iii) Bottomline\u2019s ability to implement\nits business strategy\u037e (iv) significant transaction costs associated with the proposed transaction\u037e (v) potential litigation relating to the proposed\ntransaction\u037e (vi) the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Bottomline\u2019s business, including current plans and operations\u037e (vii) the\nability of Bottomline to retain and hire key personnel\u037e (viii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the\nannouncement or completion of the proposed transaction\u037e (ix) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Bottomline\u2019s business\u037e (x)\ngeneral economic and market developments and conditions\u037e (xi) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Bottomline operates\u037e (xii)\npotential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the merger that could affect Bottomline\u2019s\nfinancial performance\u037e (xiii) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact Bottomline\u2019s ability to pursue certain business\nopportunities or strategic transactions\u037e and (xiv) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or\noutbreak of war or hostilities, as well as Bottomline\u2019s response to any of the aforementioned factors. These risks, as well as other risks associated with\nthe proposed transaction, are more fully discussed in this proxy statement. While the list of factors presented here, and the list of factors presented in\nthis proxy statement are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.\nUnlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in\nresults as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational\nproblems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Bottomline\u2019s financial\ncondition, results of operations, or liquidity. Bottomline does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking\nstatements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by\nsecurities and other applicable laws.\n22Table of Contents\nTHE SPECIAL MEETING",

As a result of the Merger, our common stock will no\nlonger be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no\nlonger file periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.\nThe Effective Time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as we,\nParent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).\nEffect on Bottomline if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Bottomline\u2019s stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not\nreceive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Bottomline will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue\nto be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the\nMerger is not completed, we expect that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject,\nincluding risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Bottomline operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.\nFurthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of our common\nstock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to the price at which it\ntrades as of the date of this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares\nof common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board of Directors will continue to evaluate and review Bottomline\u2019s business operations, strategic\ndirection and capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are deemed appropriate. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by\nBottomline\u2019s stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the\nBoard of Directors will be offered or that Bottomline\u2019s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.\nUpon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Bottomline will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $78,000,000. In\naddition, in certain circumstances, Bottomline will be required to reimburse Parent for up to $5,000,000 of its expenses associated with the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement (with such reimbursement deducted from the termination fee, should it not be payable at the time of such\ntermination but subsequently become payable).

This chronology does not purport\nto catalogue every conversation of or among members of the Board of Directors, Thoma Bravo, the Company\u2019s representatives, Thoma Bravo\u2019s\nrepresentatives, and other parties. Other than as described below, there have been no material contacts between the Company and Thoma Bravo in the\npast two years.\nAs part of its ongoing evaluation of Bottomline\u2019s business, the Board of Directors, together with senior management, regularly reviews and assesses\nBottomline\u2019s strategic direction, financial performance and business plans with a view towards strengthening Bottomline\u2019s business and identifying\nopportunities to increase stockholder value. Representatives of private equity firms and potential strategic partners have from time to time contacted\nand/or met with members of Company management to discuss the Company\u2019s business, with a view to exploring whether to pursue a potential\ntransaction with the Company.\nOn February 5, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (\u201cParty D\u201d) contacted Robert Eberle, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, seeking to\nreceive an update on the Company\u2019s business. This representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of\nthe Company. As further described below, Mr. Eberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic discussions with Party D during the period\nleading up to Party D\u2019s submission of a written expression of interest with respect to a transaction involving the Company.\nOn April 6, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (\u201cParty E\u201d) contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to receive an update on the Company\u2019s business. This\nrepresentative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr.\nEberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic discussions with Party E during the period leading up to mid-September 2021, but when\nParty E learned that the Company would be undertaking a process to solicit interest from potential acquirors, Party E indicated it did not intend to\nparticipate in the process.\nOn April 13, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (\u201cParty B\u201d) contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to receive an update on the Company\u2019s business.\nThis representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr.\nEberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic discussions with Party B during the period leading up to the Company\u2019s entry into an\nexclusivity agreement with Thoma Bravo on December 9, 2021.\nIn light of the various expressions of interest described above, Mr. Eberle contacted representatives of Deutsche Bank, whose lead representative had a\nlong-standing relationship with the Company and familiarity with the Company\u2019s business, and requested a meeting, which meeting occurred on April 16,\n2021. During this meeting, Mr. Eberle and Bruce Bowden, the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, discussed Deutsche Bank\u2019s perspectives, based on\npublic information, concerning a range of potential strategic alternatives for the Company and market perspectives of the Company.\nOn April 26, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (\u201cParty F\u201d) contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to receive an update on the Company\u2019s business.\nThis representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr.\nEberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic discussions with Party F during the period leading up to early December 2021, including\nsubmitting a written expression of interest as described below.\nOn May 4, 2021, the Company publicly announced earnings for its 2021 third fiscal quarter and provided guidance for the upcoming 2022 fiscal year. The\nCompany\u2019s financial performance had met Wall Street consensus revenue and earnings targets and the Company\u2019s publicly disclosed guidance for the\n2021 third fiscal\n33Table of Contents\nquarter. However, the Company\u2019s 2022 fiscal year guidance reflected the Company\u2019s expectation of focusing on growth investments and accelerating\nsubscription revenue growth, and as a consequence reflected anticipated earnings that were lower than Wall Street consensus for the 2022 fiscal year.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price traded down by more than 20% within the two trading days after this announcement.\nOn May 11, 2021, the Board of Directors met to discuss perspectives on the Company\u2019s strategic plan in light of the negative market reaction following\nthe Company\u2019s announcement of its 2021 third fiscal quarter results and 2022 fiscal year guidance. The Board of Directors discussed the potential\nopportunities and challenges faced by the Company in seeking to execute on its long-term business plans, including that the Company\u2019s ability to invest\nin growth opportunities was constrained by stockholder focus on near-term profitability, affecting both investment in product development as well as\nsales and marketing and go-to-market activities for existing products, and that this could create disadvantages over the longer term relative to\ncompetitors with public or private market valuations based on growth rather than earnings. The Board of Directors also discussed the Company\u2019s past\nsuccess in using acquisitions to enhance its product offerings and market scope as new technologies and opportunities emerged, and the fact that it had\nbecome more difficult to execute successful acquisitions given the increased valuations of potentially attractive targets and the constraints on the\nCompany\u2019s ability to invest in acquisitions relative to competitors with public or private market valuations based on growth rather than earnings, and that\nthe Board of Directors and the Company\u2019s senior management expected this challenge to persist. In addition, the Board of Directors discussed concerns\nrelative to attracting and retaining key, experienced talent at various levels of the Company\u2019s business, and the fact that these concerns could worsen in\nthe future given both the constraints on the Company\u2019s ability to offer competitive compensation relative to some competitors with public or private\nmarket valuations based on growth rather than earnings and the negative impact of the Company\u2019s recent stock price decline on employee incentives.\nFollowing discussion of these matters, the Board of Directors discussed a variety of potential strategic alternatives in addition to continuing to seek to\nexecute on the Company\u2019s long-term business plans, including the possibility of a spin-off or divestiture of one or more business units and the\npossibility of a sale of the Company to either a strategic or a financial buyer. The Board of Directors discussed the Company\u2019s recent interactions with\nprivate equity firms (which interactions had been discussed informally with various members of the Board of Directors prior to May 11, 2021). The Board\nof Directors discussed the risk that exploring potential strategic and financial buyer interest in a transaction, in particular through a process with broad\noutreach, could become publicly known and negatively impact new bookings, customer relationships and the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain key\ntalent. Following discussion, the Board of Directors authorized Mr. Eberle to work with necessary members of Company management and Deutsche Bank\nto implement a process to confidentially solicit indications of interest, based on publicly available information, from leading private equity firms viewed as\nbest positioned to offer the highest value for the Company, to enable the Board of Directors to consider feedback and further evaluate whether or not to\npursue a potential sale or marketing process (as opposed to continuing to execute the Company\u2019s long-term business plans or pursuing other strategic\nalternatives) and whether or not to contact additional potential financial buyers or strategic buyers. No decision was made to pursue a sale or marketing\nprocess at that time.\nOn May 17, 2021, Mr. Eberle and Mr. Bowden met with representatives of Deutsche Bank and further discussed potential strategic alternatives, including\na process for outreach to a select number of private equity firms, consistent with Mr. Eberle\u2019s discussion with the Board of Directors on May 11, 2021, to\nexplore a sale of the Company and the possibility of outreach to additional parties depending on initial feedback.\nOn June 7, 2021, Brian Jaffee of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Eberle seeking to receive an update on the Company\u2019s business.

This\nrepresentative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr.\nEberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic discussions with Party H during the period leading up to mid-October 2021.\nOn August 25, 2021, Mr. Eberle and Mr. Bowden had a meeting with representatives of Party G who expressed an interest in exploring a potential\nacquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr. Eberle and other Company and Deutsche Bank representatives engaged in periodic\ndiscussions with Party G during the period leading up to early December 2021.\nOn September 1, 2021, Mr. Eberle had a meeting with the CEO of a potential strategic partner (\u201cParty A\u201d). This meeting was scheduled at the request of\nParty A\u2019s CEO. At the meeting, Party A\u2019s CEO expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential strategic combination with the Company. Later\nthat day, the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of the Company\u2019s\noutside corporate counsel at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (\u201cWilmerHale\u201d), for the purpose of updating the Board of Directors on Mr.\nEberle\u2019s meeting with the CEO of Party A. Mr. Eberle reported that the CEO of Party A had expressed interest in exploring the possibility of a strategic\ntransaction between the Company and Party A, but had not made a specific proposal or provided any indication of the terms of such a transaction.\nOn September 9, 2021, the CEO of Party A contacted Mr. Eberle, inquiring again whether the Company would be interested in discussing a potential\nstrategic transaction with Party A. The CEO of Party A indicated to Mr. Eberle that the CEO had not discussed a potential transaction with his board, or\nreceived authority from his board to make an offer, and that Party A had not engaged a financial advisor for such a transaction, but that the CEO believed\nsuch a transaction could be priced at $52.00 per share and could consist of a combination of cash and stock consideration with a significant component\nof stock. The CEO of Party A noted that he was not yet prepared to identify the source of any financing for the cash component of the consideration and\nwould require approximately two months before he would be able to do so.\nOn September 10, 2021, Mr. Jaffee from Thoma Bravo and Mr. Eberle had a telephone conversation regarding Mr. Jaffee\u2019s interest in receiving an update\non the Company\u2019s business. No specific acquisition proposal was discussed at the time.\nOn September 10, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by members of the Company\u2019s senior management, representatives of WilmerHale\nand representatives of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, the Company\u2019s outside counsel for strategic matters (\u201cSkadden\u201d). Mr. Eberle reported\nto the Board of Directors regarding outreach he had received the prior day from the CEO of Party A, including the lack of board or financial advisor\ninvolvement by Party A at this stage, the proposed valuation, and the mix of consideration. Mr. Eberle also noted that the Company had received\noutreach from several potential private equity acquirors looking to engage in discussions with the Company. After discussion, the Board of Directors\ndetermined that it would not be in the Company\u2019s best interest at this time to engage in further discussion with Party A given the speculative nature of\nParty A\u2019s outreach and concerns raised by the Board of Directors, including with respect to the ability of Company A to finance the cash consideration\nand the prospects of Company A, but acknowledged that it may be appropriate at a later date to discuss a more concrete proposal. Accordingly, the\nBoard of Directors agreed that Mr. Eberle would communicate that message to the CEO of Party A.\n35\nTable of Contents\nMr. Eberle then updated the Board of Directors on outreach he had received on September 8, 2021, from representatives of Sachem Head Capital\nManagement LP (\u201cSachem Head\u201d), which indicated that it was working with Clearfield Capital Management LP (\u201cClearfield\u201d) and that together, they held\napproximately 4% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares beneficially, and 8% economically. The Board of Directors discussed this outreach with\nrepresentatives of Skadden, and determined that it was advisable for Mr. Eberle to engage in further discussion with Sachem Head and Clearfield.\nOn September 13, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of\nSkadden and WilmerHale. Mr. Eberle reported on a call that he and Mr. Bowden had with representatives of Sachem Head and Clearfield that day, during\nwhich those representatives requested that the Company agree to accept director nominations from Sachem Head and Clearfield for up to one month after\nthe current director nomination deadline to allow for further discussions with the Company. The representatives of Sachem Head and Clearfield had\nindicated that they believed the Company was undervalued, explained their views on the factors causing the undervaluation, and suggested that Mr.\nHilal, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Clearfield, chair a newly formed special committee of the Board of Directors to evaluate alternatives for\naccelerating growth and enhancing stockholder value. The representatives of Sachem Head and Clearfield also indicated their desire to put forward two\nnominees to the Board of Directors, proposed that the Company declassify the Board of Directors, requested that the nomination deadline be extended to\nallow for further discussion to achieve a settlement, and indicated that if the deadline were not extended, they were prepared to submit a nomination for\ntwo directors and proceed with a proxy contest. The Board of Directors discussed the various potential outcomes of an activist campaign and the risks to\nthe Company of such a process. The Board of Directors recommended that Mr. Eberle continue discussions with Sachem Head and Clearfield to see if a\nmutually agreeable resolution would be possible. The Board of Directors also discussed the recent inbound interest in a strategic transaction for the\nCompany detailed above, and authorized Company management to engage in discussions with Deutsche Bank with respect to formalizing its relationship\nwith the Company.\nBetween September 13, 2021 and September 23, 2021, discussions continued between Mr. Eberle (acting in consultation with Joseph Mullen, Chairperson\nof the Board of Directors) and representatives of Sachem Head and Clearfield, as well as between representatives of Skadden and representatives of\nSchulte Roth & Zabel LLP (\u201cSRZ\u201d), counsel to Sachem Head and Clearfield.\nOn September 23, 2021, an executive session of the Board of Directors was held, with members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives\nof Skadden and WilmerHale attending. At the executive session, the Board of Directors discussed whether to engage Deutsche Bank as a financial\nadvisor to the Company in connection with a potential evaluation of strategic alternatives for the Company. The Board of Directors discussed Deutsche\nBank\u2019s industry knowledge and expertise, and familiarity with the Company, and the fact that the lead representative of Deutsche Bank had a long-\nstanding working relationship with the Company. After discussion, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to engage Deutsche Bank as financial\nadvisor to the Company. After representatives of Deutsche Bank joined the meeting, representatives of Skadden described the current status of\nsettlement discussions with Sachem Head and Clearfield. After discussion, the Board of Directors authorized Company management to respond to the\nproposed settlement with Sachem Head and Clearfield.\nLater on September 23, 2021, a representative of Deutsche Bank contacted a representative of a potential strategic buyer to assess its interest in exploring\na strategic transaction with the Company. This representative did not express interest in further evaluating a potential transaction.\nOn October 2, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (\u201cParty I\u201d) contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to receive an update on the Company\u2019s business.\nThis representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company, but noted that Party I would\nneed to determine its equity commitment sources and that if an auction were to occur, Party I would not likely be the highest bidder. Mr. Eberle and\nrepresentatives of Deutsche Bank engaged in periodic discussions with Party I during the period leading up to late October 2021.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOn October 4, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Skadden\nand WilmerHale. The Board of Directors discussed a revised settlement proposal from Sachem Head and Clearfield, and authorized Company management\nto respond to the revised proposed settlement and agree to, among other things, the appointment of three new directors to the Board of Directors, the\nformation of a new Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors, a one-year standstill, and declassification of the Board of Directors in 2022.\nDuring early October 2021, a representative of the Company and/or a representative of Deutsche Bank conveyed to Thoma Bravo, Party B, Party C, Party\nD, Party E, Party G, Party H and Party I that if these parties wished to further pursue a transaction with the Company and obtain access to non-public\ninformation, they should submit to Deutsche Bank in the near term a written indication of interest with a proposed valuation for the Company, their\nproposed due diligence requests and a summary of their proposed material terms for a potential acquisition of the Company. Party F was not contacted at\nthis time as the Company believed that Party F was unlikely to engage at this time due to their lack of engagement and interest in recent months.\nOn October 12, 2021, the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee (the \u201cNCGC\u201d) of the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by\nmembers of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Skadden and WilmerHale. Conditioned upon the execution of a settlement\nagreement with Sachem Head and Clearfield, the NCGC recommended that the Board of Directors appoint three new directors to the Board of Directors,\nappoint one of the new directors to the NCGC, appoint one of the new directors to the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the\nBoard of Directors, and form a Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of two of the new directors and four other directors.\nOn October 19, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Skadden\nand WilmerHale. The Board of Directors considered and approved the final terms of the proposed settlement with Sachem Head and Clearfield, including\nthe proposed appointment of three new directors to the Board of Directors and the formation of a new Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAlso on October 19, 2021, a representative of Party G informed Mr. Eberle that Party G was working on a written indication of interest with support from\nits investment committee and expressed confidence in Party G\u2019s ability to enter into a definitive agreement for a transaction within three weeks. On\nOctober 20, 2021, the Company issued a press release announcing that, following engagement with stockholders Sachem Head and Clearfield, it had\nagreed to appoint three new directors to the Board of Directors, effective November 8, 2021. In addition, the Company announced that the Board of\nDirectors had formed a new Strategy Committee responsible for evaluating and making recommendations with respect to the Company\u2019s market position\nand strategy, acceleration of subscription revenue growth and opportunities to create additional stockholder value. The Company\u2019s stock price traded up\nby more than 15% within the two trading days after this announcement.\nBetween October 19 and October 26, 2021, three private equity firms (Thoma Bravo, Party B and Party C), submitted initial written indications of interest\nwith proposed price ranges. Thoma Bravo\u2019s indication of interest, received on October 22, 2021, proposed an acquisition of the Company in the range of\n$52.00 to $55.00 per share. Party B proposed an acquisition of the Company in a range of $50.00 to $55.00 per share, and Party C proposed a range of\n$50.00 to $52.00 per share. In addition, two other private equity firms (Party D and Party I) submitted written expressions of interest during this period,\nwith no specific proposed valuation. None of these parties were provided non-public information by the Company in order to formulate these indications\nor expressions of interest.\nOn October 26, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Deutsche Bank,\nSkadden and WilmerHale in attendance. Mr. Eberle updated the Board of Directors on inbound inquiries that the Company had received expressing\ninterest in exploring a strategic transaction with the Company, including with respect to the five private equity firms (Thoma Bravo,\n37\nTable of Contents\nParty B, Party C, Party D and Party I) that had submitted written indications or expressions of interest. Mr. Eberle noted that four other private equity\nfirms that had initially expressed interest in a transaction with the Company had not submitted written indications of interest (Party E, Party F, Party G and\nParty H), one strategic party (Party A) that had originally expressed interest had not been invited to submit a written indication of interest, another\nstrategic party that was not Party A had responded to outreach from Deutsche Bank on October 22, 2021, indicating that its interest did not include an\nacquisition of the entire Company, and a third strategic party had responded to outreach from Deutsche Bank indicating that it was not interested in\nengaging with the Company due to lack of a strategic fit. The Board of Directors also discussed the Company\u2019s current five-year financial model for the\nCompany and opportunities and challenges facing the Company in the coming years. After discussion, the Board of Directors authorized Company\nmanagement to enter into non-disclosure agreements (\u201cNDAs\u201d) with four of the five private equity firms (Thoma Bravo, Party B, Party C and Party D) that\nhad submitted written indications or expressions of interest, and to provide non-public information to such firms. The Board of Directors determined that\nthe Company should terminate discussions with the fifth private equity firm (Party I) based on its belief that any potential offer from Party I would require\nvalidating sources of funds including third party equity commitments. The Board of Directors authorized Deutsche Bank to make additional outreach to\ncertain specified strategic parties and additional private equity firms, which were selected by Deutsche Bank based on its knowledge of the Company and\nthe markets in which it operates, and seek to determine their level of interest in a potential transaction with the Company. The Board of Directors also\ndetermined not to pursue further discussions with the four private equity firms that had not submitted written indications of interest (Party E, Party F,\nParty G and Party H) and Party A for several reasons, including the valuation proposed, the uncertainty as to the source of the cash component of Party\nA\u2019s original proposal, and the uncertainty created by the likely need for a vote by Party A\u2019s stockholders.\nFollowing the October 26, 2021 meeting of the Board of Directors, representatives of Deutsche Bank contacted five additional strategic parties and three\nadditional private equity firms consistent with discussion with the Board of Directors.\nBetween November 8, 2021 and December 4, 2021, the Company executed NDAs with seven private equity firms consistent with discussions with the\nBoard of Directors, including the four private equity firms that had submitted written indications or expressions of interest and were discussed with the\nBoard of Directors on October 26, 2021 (this included Thoma Bravo, which entered into an NDA on November 11, 2021, and Party B, which entered into an\nNDA on November 8, 2021, Party D, which entered into an NDA on November 10, 2021, and Party F, which entered into an NDA on December 4, 2021). All\nseven of the NDAs included standstill provisions which would automatically terminate upon announcement by the Company of an acquisition\ntransaction. None of the strategic parties with whom the Company or its representatives had contact (whether before or after the October 26, 2021\nmeeting of the Board of Directors) entered into an NDA with the Company and, except for the discussions with Party A described above, all of these\nstrategic parties either expressed a lack of interest in pursuing an acquisition of the Company or failed to respond following outreach.\nBeginning on November 15, 2021, management conducted management presentations with each of the seven private equity firms that had entered into\nNDAs with the Company. Six of the seven firms were then given access to a virtual data room that had been established by the Company to facilitate due\ndiligence. The seventh firm declined data room access.\nOn November 17, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Deutsche Bank,\nSkadden and WilmerHale in attendance. Representatives of Skadden reviewed the role of the Board of Directors in a potential sale transaction and\ndiscussed related legal considerations. Company management reviewed with the Board of Directors the Company\u2019s five-year financial model that would\nbe provided to potential acquirors and used for purposes of financial analyses to be conducted by Deutsche Bank, which management noted was a more\ndetailed version of the model discussed at the meeting of the Board of Directors on October 26, 2021. This financial model is identical, other than\nimmaterial differences, to the projections included at \u201c \u2014Certain Financial Projections\u201d beginning on page 53. Mr. Eberle updated the Board of Directors\non management presentations that had been given that week and upcoming\n38\nTable of Contents\nscheduled presentations. Representatives of Deutsche Bank summarized the results of their outreach to strategic parties, indicating that Deutsche Bank\nhad contacted seven additional potential strategic acquirors of the Company and that none had expressed interest in entering into an NDA in order to\nreceive non-public information concerning the Company.\nDuring the latter part of November 2021 and early December 2021, several private equity firms contacted Deutsche Bank inquiring whether the Company\nwas considering a sale process. Deutsche Bank did not confirm that the Company was engaged in a sale process or invite participation in a process by\nthese private equity firms, and these private equity firms made no further efforts to engage Deutsche Bank or the Company.\nOn November 29, 2021, a draft of the merger agreement was uploaded to the data room for all bidders to review, and instructions were provided for a\nmarkup to be included with bids due on December 6, 2021. This initial draft proposed a go-shop period and lower termination fee for parties identified\nduring the go-shop period. This initial draft did not include a financing contingency\u037e however, given the expectation that bidders (all of whom were then\nanticipated to be private equity firms) would seek debt financing, this initial draft proposed that the Company\u2019s ability to obtain specific performance to\nconsummate the Merger would be contingent on the availability of a bidder\u2019s debt financing and that if specific performance were not available, the\nCompany\u2019s recourse would be limited to a reverse termination fee. In addition, the draft proposed full acceleration of all Company equity awards at\nclosing. The instructions for the bids due on December 6, 2021 referred bidders to capitalization assumptions contained in the virtual data room, which\ncapitalization assumptions included fully diluted capitalization of approximately 47.4 million shares as of September 30, 2021 and described additional\nshares to be issued in the ordinary course of business prior to the closing pursuant to equity awards to certain recent or prospective new employees and\nunder the second tranche of the Company\u2019s fiscal year 2022 equity awards to non-named executive officer employees.\nOn December 2, 2021, Party F submitted a written expression of interest addressed to the Company CEO and the Chairman of the Board of Directors,\nindicating its interest in participating in the process with respect to a potential transaction. The expression of interest did not include a specific proposed\nvaluation. Party F entered into an NDA with the Company on December 4, 2021 and subsequently received a management presentation from the\nCompany, access to the data room and the draft merger agreement on December 6, 2021. However, Party F did not make a further proposal to acquire the\nCompany. Also on December 2, 2021, a representative of Party G informed Mr. Eberle that it was no longer interested in making a proposal to acquire the\nCompany given the increase in the Company\u2019s stock price following the Company\u2019s announcement of the formation of the Strategy Committee. A\nrepresentative of Party G subsequently sent an email to Mr. Eberle on December 8, 2021 confirming that Party G would not be making a proposal to\nacquire the Company on the timeline suggested by the Company but would seek to line up the necessary resources and approvals to further engage after\nthe holidays.\nOn December 7, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted an updated written indication of interest, with a per share value of $56.50. Thoma Bravo requested\nexclusivity for a seven-day period to negotiate a transaction. Thoma Bravo also provided an equity commitment letter from Thoma Bravo Fund XV, L.P.\ncovering 100% of the consideration payable in the Merger, and a markup of the draft merger agreement, which markup proposed the following material\nrevisions: eliminating the go-shop period and lower termination fee for parties identified during the go-shop period, adding a quantitative threshold for\nthe accuracy of the Company\u2019s capitalization representations as a condition to closing, eliminating the requirement that debt financing be available in\norder for the Company to obtain specific performance to consummate the Merger (subject to the satisfaction of other conditions) and eliminating a\nreverse termination fee, adding a cap on post-termination damages, adding expense reimbursement by the Company in the event of a termination in which\na termination fee could in the future become payable by the Company, expanding Thoma Bravo\u2019s termination rights and the circumstances triggering\npayment of a termination fee by the Company, and eliminating acceleration of Company equity awards (other than as provided by existing plans and\naward agreements) such that unvested awards would be converted into time-based cash awards with their existing vesting schedule\u037e and including\ncertain modifications to the overall\n39\nTable of Contents\nsuite of representations, warranties and covenants to be provided by each party under the merger agreement. This indication of interest assumed fully\ndiluted capitalization of the Company no greater than approximately 47.4 million shares.\nOn December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Deutsche Bank,\nSkadden and WilmerHale in attendance, as well as a representative from the Company\u2019s strategic communications advisor, Joele Frank. Representatives of\nDeutsche Bank updated the Board of Directors on the updated proposal submitted by Thoma Bravo, indicated that an updated proposal was expected\nfrom Party B soon, noted that the remaining private equity firms that had received presentations and due diligence material had indicated that they were\nnot interested in pursuing a transaction with the Company (and the reasons conveyed by those entities, which included concerns about future organic\ngrowth opportunities, focusing on other transactions, and investment theses being challenged through diligence), and noted that no serious interest had\nbeen expressed by the strategic companies to which Deutsche Bank had initiated outreach. The Board of Directors discussed the proposal from Thoma\nBravo and directed Deutsche Bank to inform Thoma Bravo that the Company would respond after the Board of Directors\u2019 meeting to be held the\nfollowing day. The Board of Directors also considered and approved the Company\u2019s five-year financial model that had been reviewed with the Board of\nDirectors at the November 17 meeting. This financial model is identical, other than immaterial differences, to the projections included at \u201c \u2014Certain\nFinancial Projections\u201d beginning on page 53.\nOn December 8, 2021, representatives of Deutsche Bank and Party B held a phone conversation whereby Party B continued to indicate its interest in\nacquiring the Company but expressed the necessity to continue its due diligence into January 2022.\nLater on December 8, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Deutsche\nBank, Skadden and WilmerHale in attendance. Representatives of Deutsche Bank updated the Board of Directors on discussions with Party B, its\ncontinued interest in the Company and the additional time that Party B had requested to conduct further diligence before submitting an updated written\nproposal. Representatives of Deutsche Bank also presented an analysis of Thoma Bravo\u2019s bid, and representatives of Skadden described generally the\nstatus of the merger agreement negotiations. The Board of Directors instructed the representatives of Deutsche Bank to request Thoma Bravo to increase\nits bid and express willingness to work to finalize negotiations on the timeframe proposed by Thoma Bravo if such an increase were acceptable to the\nBoard of Directors, but to resist exclusivity in light of ongoing discussions with Party B.\nOn December 9, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted an updated written offer, described as its \u201cbest and final\u201d offer, of $57.00 per share, which was also\nconditioned on a seven-day exclusivity period (which would automatically extend for an additional seven days unless terminated by either party at the\nend of the initial period).\nLater on December 9, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Deutsche\nBank, Skadden and WilmerHale in attendance. Representatives of Deutsche Bank described the updated bid from Thoma Bravo and the communication\nregarding Thoma Bravo\u2019s bid and eagerness to finalize the transaction. Representatives of Skadden reviewed legal considerations pertaining to the Board\nof Directors\u2019 consideration of a sale of the Company, and the Board of Directors discussed the opportunities, risks and challenges of remaining an\nindependent public company as compared to being acquired. The Board of Directors discussed the financial and legal terms of the proposal, and\nauthorized the Company to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Thoma Bravo and to proceed to finalize negotiations with respect to their proposal.\nLater that day, representatives of Skadden and representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d), counsel to Thoma Bravo, exchanged signatures from\ntheir respective clients on an agreed-upon seven day exclusivity agreement. Thereafter, representatives from Kirkland and Skadden spoke regarding next\nsteps, and representatives from Kirkland indicated that Thoma Bravo would require voting agreements from members of the Board of Directors (including\nMr. Eberle) and Clearfield. Following that discussion, also on December 9, 2021, Kirkland provided Skadden with a form of the proposed voting\nagreement.\n40\nTable of Contents\nAlso on December 9, 2021, Bloomberg reported that the Company was exploring a potential sale and other options with assistance from Deutsche Bank\nand had attracted interest from private equity buyers. The Company did not comment on this report.\nDuring the period following the Company\u2019s entry into an exclusivity agreement with Thoma Bravo on December 9, 2021 through the public announcement\nof the Merger on December 17, 2021, approximately nine private equity firms or financial advisors purporting to represent possible buyers contacted\nDeutsche Bank inquiring as to whether the Company was exploring a sale transaction, and Deutsche Bank did not engage with any of these parties given\nthe Company\u2019s exclusivity agreement with Thoma Bravo. However, no proposals were made by any of these third parties.\nDuring the period following the Company\u2019s entry into an exclusivity agreement with Thoma Bravo, representatives of the Company had discussions with\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo relating to Thoma Bravo\u2019s ongoing due diligence.\nOn December 12, 2021, representatives of Skadden sent proposed revisions to the Kirkland draft of the merger agreement and the equity commitment\nletter, which proposed the following material revisions: specifying the amount of the termination fee payable by the Company, increasing the quantitative\nthreshold for the accuracy of the Company\u2019s capitalization representations as a condition to closing, increasing the cap on post-termination damages,\nlimiting certain of Thoma Bravo\u2019s termination rights and the circumstances triggering payment of a termination fee by the Company, and providing for 30\nmonths of accelerated vesting (which includes the existing 12 month entitlement under the Company\u2019s 2019 equity plan for equity awards, with unvested\nawards being converted into time-based cash awards with their existing vesting schedule pulled forward by 30 months)\u037e and including certain\nmodifications to the overall suite of representations, warranties and covenants to be provided by each party under the merger agreement. Also on\nDecember 12, 2021, Skadden shared the proposed form of voting agreement with members of the Board of Directors.\nOn December 13, 2021, representatives of SRZ provided comments on the voting agreement with Clearfield to Skadden, and Skadden provided such\ncomments to Kirkland.\nOn December 14, 2021, Skadden received markups of the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter from Kirkland, which proposed the following\nmaterial revisions: decreasing the quantitative threshold for the accuracy of the Company\u2019s capitalization representations as a condition to closing,\ndecreasing the cap on post-termination damages, altering the accelerated vesting proposed by the Company (in addition to the existing 12 month\nentitlement under the Company\u2019s 2019 equity plan for equity awards) in a manner that meaningfully decreased the overall level of acceleration of equity\nawards versus the Company\u2019s proposal, capping the number of times that the Company could adjourn or postpone the stockholder meeting without\nThoma Bravo\u2019s consent, requesting additional information with respect to and/or limiting the Company\u2019s ability to issue equity awards to certain recent\nor prospective new employees and to issue the second tranche of its fiscal year 2022 equity awards to non-named executive officer employees in the\nordinary course of business prior to the closing\u037e and including certain modifications to the overall suite of representations, warranties and covenants to\nbe provided by each party under the merger agreement. Also on December 14, 2021, Skadden sent additional proposed revisions to the voting agreement\nto Kirkland and to SRZ. Later that day, Kirkland returned the draft voting agreement with non-substantive revisions.\nOn December 15, 2021, Skadden sent a markup of the merger agreement and a revised draft of the disclosure schedules to the merger agreement to\nKirkland, reflecting resolution of issues that Skadden and Kirkland had discussed on telephone calls and over email, including with respect to the specific\nregulatory approvals required for completion of the Merger, the amount of the cap on post-termination damages, the agreed treatment of Company equity\nawards in the transaction, the Company\u2019s ability to issue equity awards to certain recent or prospective new employees and to issue the second tranche\nof its fiscal year 2022 equity awards to non-named executive officer employees in the ordinary course of business prior to the closing, and the Company\u2019s\nflexibility\n41\nTable of Contents\nto determine quarterly bonuses in the ordinary course of business prior to the closing (including the amount for the current calendar quarter available to\nbe paid to the Chief Financial Officer prior to December 31, 2021 as described under \u201c\u2014Interests of Bottomline\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 55). Skadden and Kirkland continued to confer and exchange drafts in order to finalize the merger agreement, voting\nagreement and disclosure schedules, until agreement on the final execution version was reached. Also on December 15, 2021, Company management\nprovided revised capitalization information to Thoma Bravo, reflecting fully diluted capitalization of the Company at September 30, 2021 of approximately\n45 million shares.\nOn December 16, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Deutsche Bank,\nSkadden and WilmerHale in attendance.

In recommending that Bottomline\u2019s stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, the\nBoard of Directors considered numerous positive factors relating to the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, including the following material factors (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):\n\u2022\nThe relationship of the Per Share Merger Consideration to trading prices of Bottomline\u2019s common stock, representing a premium of: (1)\napproximately 41% and 40% to the unaffected 30-day and 60-day (respectively) volume weighted average stock price of Bottomline\u2019s\ncommon stock as of October 19, 2021, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the appointment of Michael Curran, Philip Hilal and\nLarry Klane to the Board of Directors\u037e and (2) approximately 13% to the closing price of Bottomline\u2019s common stock on December 15, 2021,\nthe last trading day prior to the date on which Bottomline entered into the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nThe perceived risks and benefits of a variety of strategic alternatives for Bottomline, including a possible sale of Bottomline to potential\nstrategic or financial buyers other than Thoma Bravo, or a spin-off or divestiture of certain business units and the perceived lack of any\nacquisition candidate or merger partner that would be transformative to Bottomline\u2019s business and available on attractive terms if\nBottomline remained a public company.\n\u2022\nThe financial forecasts prepared by Bottomline\u2019s senior management team, which reflected the potential impact of multiple key growth\ndrivers across Bottomline\u2019s lines of business on a standalone basis. In addition, the view of the Board of Directors (which view was shared\nby Bottomline\u2019s senior management and by its financial advisor) that these financial forecasts were based on assumptions that are difficult\nto project and were subject to high levels of uncertainty and also significant execution risk.\n\u2022\nThe current and prospective business environment in which Bottomline operates, including international, national and local economic\nconditions, the competitive environment and the likely effect of these factors on Bottomline and the execution of Bottomline\u2019s standalone\nstrategic plans.\n\u2022\nThe pace and magnitude of ongoing changes in the market for Bottomline\u2019s products and the view of the Board of Directors (which view\nwas shared by Bottomline\u2019s senior management and by its financial advisor) that the Company\u2019s ability to invest in growth opportunities\nwas constrained by stockholder focus on near-term profitability, affecting both investment in product development as well as sales and\nmarketing and go-to-market activities for existing products, which could create disadvantages over the longer term relative to competitors\nwith public or private market valuations based on growth rather than earnings.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s past success in using acquisitions to enhance its product offerings and market scope as new technologies and\nopportunities emerged, and the view of the Board of Directors (which view was shared by Bottomline\u2019s senior management and by its\nfinancial advisor) that it could be more difficult to execute successful acquisitions in the future given the increased valuations of potentially\nattractive targets and the constraints on the Company\u2019s ability to invest in acquisitions relative to competitors with public or private market\nvaluations based on growth rather than earnings.\n\u2022\nConcerns relative to attracting and retaining key, experienced talent at various levels of the Company\u2019s business, and the view of the Board\nof Directors (which view was shared by Bottomline\u2019s senior management and by its financial advisor) that these concerns could worsen in\nthe future given both the constraints on the Company\u2019s ability to offer competitive compensation relative to some competitors with public\nor private market valuations based on growth rather than earnings and the negative impact of recent and potential future declines in the\nCompany\u2019s stock price on employee incentives.\n43\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nThe view of the Board of Directors (which view was shared by Bottomline\u2019s senior management and by its financial advisor) that certain of\nthe risks described above could occur in combination to negatively affect Bottomline and its business.\n\u2022\nThe fact that the all-cash Per Share Merger Consideration will provide certainty of value and liquidity to Bottomline\u2019s stockholders, while\neliminating the effects of long-term business and execution risk to Bottomline\u2019s stockholders.\n\u2022\nThe fact that Bottomline was contacted by a number of parties and/or actively sought proposals from additional parties that it and its\nfinancial advisor believed were logical potential buyers, as more fully described above under the heading \u201c\u2014 Background of the Merger,\u201d\nincluding both strategic and financial buyers:\n\u2022\nBottomline and its financial advisor collectively communicated with eight strategic buyers and eleven financial buyers regarding their\ninterest in acquiring the Company, Bottomline entered into NDAs with seven financial buyers, Bottomline conducted management\npresentations attended by seven financial buyers (including Party B and Party C), and Bottomline granted access to a data room to six\nfinancial buyers.\n\u2022\nOf these parties, Thoma Bravo, Party B and Party C submitted written proposals with a specified price range.\n\u2022\nOnly Thoma Bravo submitted a proposed final equity commitment letter for the full amount of the merger consideration and proposed\na discrete limited period of additional time for confirmatory due diligence and negotiation.\n\u2022\nParty B indicated a price range of $50.00 to $55.00 per share and required additional time to conduct further diligence before\nsubmitting an updated written proposal.\n\u2022\nThe fact that Thoma Bravo\u2019s final price had increased from an initial range of $52.00 to $55.00 per share, to a subsequent bid of $56.50 per\nshare, and ultimately to a final bid of $57.00 per share, which Bottomline, after consultation with its financial advisor, believed was the\nmaximum price at which Thoma Bravo would transact.\n\u2022\nThe risk that prolonging the sale process further could have resulted in the loss of the opportunity to successfully consummate a\ntransaction on favorable terms and potentially jeopardized customer and employee relationships.\n\u2022\nThe financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Board of Directors by representatives of Deutsche Bank at numerous meetings of\nthe Board of Directors in connection with the Merger, which included the opinion of Deutsche Bank that, as of December 16, 2021, and\nbased upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to holders\nof shares of Bottomline common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more\nfully described below under the caption \u201c \u2014 Opinion of Bottomline\u2019s Financial Advisor.\u201d\n\u2022\nThe terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and related transaction documents, including:\n\u2022\nParent\u2019s commitments in the Merger Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger (subject to the terms and\nconditions of the Merger Agreement)\u037e\n\u2022\nThe fact that Parent\u2019s obligation to complete the Merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing\u037e\n\u2022\nThe equity commitment by the Thoma Bravo Fund to the transaction and the fact that Bottomline is a named third party beneficiary in\nthe equity commitment letter\u037e\n\u2022\nBottomline\u2019s ability, subject to certain conditions in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance of the Thoma Bravo Fund\u2019s\nobligation to make the equity contributions pursuant to\n44\nTable of Contents\nthe equity commitment letter (and, if specific performance is not obtained, to seek damages for Parent\u2019s willful and material breach of\nthe Merger Agreement (subject to a cap of $195,000,000), which damages are covered by the equity commitment letter from the Thoma\nBravo Fund)\u037e\n\u2022\nBottomline\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance to prevent\nbreaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce the terms of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nParent\u2019s commitment in the Merger Agreement to take all actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the equity financing\npursuant to the terms of the equity commitment letter\u037e\n\u2022\nBottomline\u2019s ability, in certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations\nwith a third party regarding an unsolicited alternative acquisition proposal that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after\nconsulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior\nproposal\u037e\n\u2022\nThe ability of the Board of Directors to change its recommendation in response to a superior proposal or terminate the Merger\nAgreement in favor of a superior proposal, subject to Parent\u2019s ability to match such superior proposal and subject to the Company\u2019s\npayment to Parent of a termination fee of $78,000,000\u037e\n\u2022\nThe ability of the Board of Directors to change its recommendation in response to an intervening event not related to an alternative\nacquisition proposal not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Board of Directors prior to December 16, 2021, subject to Parent\u2019s\nability to propose adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement that may convince the Board of Directors not to\nchange its recommendation, and subject to Parent\u2019s right to terminate the Merger Agreement following such change in\nrecommendation and to collect a termination fee of $78,000,000\u037e\n\u2022\nThe fact that the termination fee payable by the Company is approximately equal to 3% of the purchase price, which amount the\nBoard of Directors believed was reasonable in light of, among other matters, the benefits of the Merger to Bottomline\u2019s stockholders,\nthe typical size of such termination fees in similar transactions and the likelihood that a fee of such size would not be a meaningful\ndeterrent to alternative acquisition proposals\u037e\n\u2022\nThe fact that the Merger is subject to the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Bottomline\u2019s common\nstock, and the fact that, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, the Company had received the support of holders of approximately 4% of\nthe Company\u2019s outstanding shares, as of the date of the Voting Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nThe fact that the end date is December 16, 2022, allowing for sufficient time to complete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nThe fact that the Merger Agreement has customary terms and was the product of extensive arms-length negotiations by Bottomline\nand Bottomline\u2019s professional advisors\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe fact that the Voting Agreement terminates in the event that the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in any manner thereunder,\nas more fully described under the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u2014The\nVoting Agreement\u201d.\n\u2022\nThe availability of statutory appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger for Company stockholders who properly\nexercise their rights under the DGCL.\n\u2022\nThe fact that resolutions approving the Merger Agreement were unanimously approved by the Board of Directors, which is comprised of a\nmajority of independent directors who are neither affiliated with Thoma Bravo nor employees of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries, and\nwhich retained and received advice from Bottomline\u2019s outside legal counsel and financial advisor in evaluating, negotiating and\nrecommending the terms of the Merger Agreement.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIn the course of reaching the determinations and decisions and making the recommendation described above, the Board of Directors, in consultation with\nBottomline\u2019s senior management, outside legal counsel and financial advisor, considered the risks and potentially negative factors relating to the Merger\nAgreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the following material factors (which factors are not\nnecessarily presented in order of relative importance):\n\u2022\nThe fact that Bottomline\u2019s public stockholders will have no ongoing equity interest in the surviving corporation following the Merger,\nmeaning that the stockholders will cease to participate in Bottomline\u2019s potential future earnings or growth and benefit from any potential\nincreases in the value of Bottomline\u2019s common stock.\n\u2022\nThe possibility that the consummation of the Merger may be delayed or not occur at all, and the adverse impact such event would have on\nBottomline and its business.\n\u2022\nThe restrictions on the conduct of Bottomline\u2019s business during the period between execution of the Merger Agreement and the\nconsummation of the Merger, which may delay or prevent Bottomline from undertaking business opportunities that may arise during such\ntime which, absent the Merger Agreement, Bottomline might otherwise have pursued.\n\u2022\nThe possible disruption to Bottomline\u2019s business that may result from announcement of the Merger and the resulting distraction of\nmanagement\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations of the business.\n\u2022\nThe potential negative effect of the pendency of the Merger Agreement on Bottomline\u2019s business, including:\n\u2022\nuncertainty about the effect of the proposed Merger on Bottomline\u2019s employees, which may impair Bottomline\u2019s ability to attract,\nretain and motivate key personnel\u037e and\n\u2022\nuncertainty about the effect of the proposed Merger on Bottomline\u2019s customers, suppliers and other third parties, which could cause\ncustomers, suppliers and other third parties to seek to change existing business relationships with Bottomline.\n\u2022\nThe fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Bottomline is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the pendency of\nthe Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nThe fact that if the Merger is not consummated, Bottomline will be required to pay its own expenses associated with the Merger Agreement,\nand the fact that the resulting public announcement of termination of the Merger Agreement could affect the trading price of Bottomline\u2019s\ncommon stock.\n\u2022\nThe fact that Bottomline must pay a termination fee of $78,000,000 to Parent if the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with the\nCompany accepting a superior proposal, due to the Board of Directors\u2019 changing or withdrawing its recommendation of the Merger, or\nunder certain other circumstances in connection with the Company entering into an agreement for a transaction involving at least 50% of\nthe Company\u2019s stock or assets.\n\u2022\nThe fact that Bottomline must reimburse Parent\u2019s expenses up to $5,000,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain\ncircumstances (with the amount of such expenses deducted from any termination fee that subsequently becomes payable to Parent by\nBottomline).\n\u2022\nThe fact that the receipt of cash by stockholders in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\u2022\nThe fact that the completion of the Merger requires certain regulatory clearances and consents, including under U.S. antitrust rules and\nU.K. financial regulatory authority rules, which clearances and consents could subject the Merger to unforeseen delays and risk.\n\u2022\nThe fact that some of Bottomline\u2019s directors and executive officers may be deemed to have interests in the Merger that are different from, or\nin addition to, the interests of Bottomline\u2019s stockholders generally, as more fully described below under the caption \u201c\u2014Interests of\nBottomline\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\n46\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nThe risk of potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against the Company or its directors or officers, and potential\neffects of outcomes related thereto.\n\u2022\nThe possible loss of key management or other personnel of Bottomline during the pendency of the Merger.\nThe Board of Directors believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the Merger to Bottomline\u2019s stockholders outweighed the risks and uncertainties of\nthe Merger.\nThe foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board of Directors contains the material factors considered by the Board of Directors, but is not in\nany way intended to be exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger, the Board of Directors did\nnot find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determinations and\nrecommendations. Each member of the Board of Directors applied his or her own business judgment to the process and may have given different weight\nto different factors. The Board of Directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor or any particular aspect of a\nfactor supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board of Directors based its recommendation on the totality of the information\npresented.\nOpinion of Bottomline\u2019s Financial Advisor\nPursuant to an engagement letter dated as of September 20, 2021, Deutsche Bank acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors in connection with\nthe Merger. At the December 16, 2021 meeting of the Board of Directors, Deutsche Bank delivered its opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the\neffect that, as of the date of such opinion, based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other conditions set forth in the\nopinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Bottomline\u2019s common stock.\nThe full text of Deutsche Bank\u2019s written opinion, dated as of December 17, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters\nconsidered and limitations, qualifications and conditions of the review undertaken by Deutsche Bank in connection with its opinion, is attached as Annex\nB to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Holders of Bottomline\u2019s common stock are urged to read Deutsche Bank\u2019s opinion in its entirety.\n47\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with Deutsche Bank\u2019s role as financial advisor to the Board of Directors, and in arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank has, among other\nthings, reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information concerning the Company and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and\nother information relating to the Company prepared and furnished to Deutsche Bank by the management of the Company and approved for Deutsche\nBank\u2019s use by the Company. Deutsche Bank also held discussions with certain senior officers of the Company regarding the businesses and prospects of\nthe Company. In addition, Deutsche Bank has:\n\u2022\nreviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Bottomline\u2019s common stock\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies Deutsche\nBank considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business combinations which it deemed relevant\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate.\nIn preparing its opinion, Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for the independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any\ninformation, whether publicly available or furnished to it, concerning the Company, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in\nconnection with the rendering of its opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, with the knowledge and permission of the Board, Deutsche Bank\nassumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. Deutsche Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the\nproperties or assets and did not prepare, obtain or review any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (including any\ncontingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets or liabilities) of the Company or any of its respective subsidiaries, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the\nsolvency or fair value of the Company under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. With respect to the financial forecasts made\navailable to Deutsche Bank and used in its analyses, Deutsche Bank, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, assumed that such\nforecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as\nto the matters covered thereby. In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts and projections or\nthe assumptions on which they are based. Deutsche Bank\u2019s opinion was necessarily based upon the economic, market and other conditions as in effect\non, and the information made available to Deutsche Bank as of, the date of such opinion. Deutsche Bank expressly disclaimed any undertaking or\nobligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting Deutsche Bank\u2019s opinion of which it becomes aware after the date of the\nopinion.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, has assumed that, in all respects\nmaterial to its analysis:\n\u2022\nthe Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, without any waiver, modification or amendment of\nany term, condition or agreement that would be material to Deutsche Bank\u2019s analysis\u037e and\n\u2022\nall material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the Merger will be\nobtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions,\nterms or conditions will be imposed that would be material to Deutsche Bank\u2019s analysis.\nDeutsche Bank is not a legal, regulatory, tax or accounting expert and has relied on the assessments made by the Company and its other advisors with\nrespect to these issues.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses contained in the presentation that was made by Deutsche Bank to the Board on December\n16, 2021 and that were used by Deutsche Bank in connection with\n48\nTable of Contents\nrendering its opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses\nperformed by Deutsche Bank, nor does the order of the analyses described below represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by\nDeutsche Bank or the Board. Considering the data below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the\nmethodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Deutsche Bank\u2019s financial analyses. Certain\nfinancial, comparative and other analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the\ntext of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Deutsche Bank\u2019s financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following\nquantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before December 15, 2021, and is not\nnecessarily indicative of current market conditions. In performing its analyses, Deutsche Bank made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. None of the Company,\nParent, Merger Sub, Deutsche Bank or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any\nestimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly\nmore or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the businesses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the\nprices at which the businesses could actually be sold.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nDeutsche Bank performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company on a standalone basis using financial forecasts, data and other information\nprovided by the Company\u2019s management to calculate a range of implied equity values per share of the Company discounted to December 15, 2021.\nIn performing the discounted cash flow analysis, Deutsche Bank applied a range of discount rates of 9.00% to 10.00% to the sum of (i) unlevered free\ncash flows estimated to be generated by the Company for the fiscal years 2022 to 2031, as calculated based on financial forecasts and data provided by\nthe Company\u2019s management and (ii) estimated terminal values of the Company calculated using perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.50% to 3.50%. For\npurposes of its analysis, Deutsche Bank calculated unlevered free cash flow as (a) adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(which we refer to as \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d), less (b) capital expenditures, less (c) stock based compensation, less (d) cash taxes, plus (e) increase\n(decrease) in deferred revenue, and less (f) increase (decrease) in working capital, in each case as provided to Deutsche Bank by the Company\u2019s\nmanagement.\nDeutsche Bank derived the foregoing range of discount rates using a weighted average cost of capital analysis based on a risk free rate of 1.87% using\nthe 20-year U.S. Treasury yield as of December 15, 2021, and certain other financial metrics, including betas, for the Company and the other selected\ncompanies described below.\nThe analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Bottomline\u2019s common stock of $41.90 to $57.21 per share.\nAnalysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies\nDeutsche Bank compared certain financial information and commonly used valuation measurements for the Company to corresponding information and\nmeasurements of certain publicly traded companies that Deutsche Bank considered relevant for the Company. In determining the universe of comparable\ncompanies for the Company, Deutsche Bank considered a variety of factors, based on publicly available information, including, but not limited to,\nsimilarity in company portfolio, size and geographic exposure. However, because of the inherent differences between the businesses, operations and\nprospects of the Company and those of the selected comparable companies, Deutsche Bank believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not,\nrely solely on the quantitative results of the selected publicly traded company analysis. Accordingly, Deutsche Bank also made qualitative judgments\nconcerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and\n49\nTable of Contents\nprospects of the Company and the selected comparable companies that could affect the values of the Company in order to provide a context in which to\nconsider the results of the quantitative analysis for Company. Deutsche Bank selected comparable companies with businesses in the categories of\nfinancial software and payment technology.\nTo calculate the trading multiples for the selected companies, Deutsche Bank used publicly available information concerning historical and projected\nfinancial performance, including published historical financial information and forecasted estimates based on widely used industry data and research\nproviders and public filings made by the selected companies. Using such financial information, Deutsche Bank reviewed for each of these companies,\namong other things: (i) the ratio of enterprise value to Adjusted EBITDA (which we refer to as \u201cEV/EBITDA\u201d) and (ii) the ratio of enterprise value to\nrevenue (which we refer to as \u201cEV/Revenue\u201d). The companies reviewed and analysis indicated the following, with multiples based on publicly available\nresearch analyst median calendar year 2022 estimates:\nCompany\nEV /\nEBITDA\n(2022E)\nEV /\nRevenue\n(2022E)\nBank / Payment Technology\nTemenos AG\n21.4x\n9.9x\nJack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n19.7x\n6.1x\nFidelity National Information Services Inc.\n12.3x\n5.6x\nGlobal Payments Inc.\n11.0x\n5.4x\nFiserv, Inc.\n12.9x\n5.5x\nACI Worldwide Inc.\n12.1x\n3.5x\nB2B Payments\nRepay Holdings, Inc.\n15.9x\n7.0x\nEdenred SE\n14.7x\n6.1x\nFLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.\n12.7x\n7.1x\nWEX, Inc.\n9.4x\n4.1x\nBill.com Holdings Inc..\nn/a*\n42.1x\nPaymentus Holdings, Inc.\nn/a*\n6.9x\nEsker SA\nn/a*\n12.7x\nBTRS Holdings, Inc.\nn/a*\n6.6x\nAvidXchange Holdings, Inc.\nn/a*\n10.8x\n*\nMultiples that are negative or above 40.0x for EBITDA are considered not meaningful.\nBased in part upon the EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenue multiples of the selected companies described above and taking into account their professional\njudgment and experience, Deutsche Bank calculated ranges of estimated implied value per share of Bottomline\u2019s common stock by:\n\u2022\napplying multiples of EV/EBITDA of 16.0x to 20.0x to the Company\u2019s management estimates of CY 2022 Adjusted EBITDA, resulting in a\nrange of implied values of $40.14 to $50.20 per share of Bottomline\u2019s common stock\u037e and\n\u2022\napplying multiples of EV/Revenue of 4.0x to 5.0x to the Company\u2019s management estimates of CY 2022 revenue, resulting in a range of implied\nvalues of $50.00 to $62.53 per share of Bottomline\u2019s common stock\nAnalysis of Selected Precedent Transactions\nDeutsche Bank reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of thirteen financial software and payment technology transactions since\nApril 2018 that Deutsche Bank deemed, in its professional judgment and experience, as comparable to the Company in certain business and financial\nrespects. In its analysis, Deutsche\n50\nTable of Contents\nBank derived and compared, among other things, the mean and median values of multiples for the ratio of total enterprise value to last-twelve-months\nAdjusted EBITDA (which we refer to as \u201cTEV/LTM EBITDA\u201d). To calculate the comparative data for the selected transactions, Deutsche Bank used\npublicly available information from public filings, FactSet and Wall Street research. The transactions reviewed and analysis indicated the following:\nMonth and \nYear Announced\nTarget/Acquiror\nTEV/LTM\nEBITDA\nMarch 2021\nItiviti / Broadridge\n25.0x\nDecember 2020\nRealpage, Inc. / Thoma Bravo\n32.4x\nNovember 2020\nNets A/S / Nexi\n15.7x\nOctober 2020\nAvaloq / NEC\n23.7x\nOctober 2020\nSIA / Nexi\n16.8x\nAugust 2020\nEllie Mae / Intercontinental Exchange\n23.4x\nJuly 2020\nMajesco / Thoma Bravo\n37.5x\nFebruary 2020\nIngenico / Worldline\n14.7x\nMay 2019\nTotal System Services / Global Payments Network\n18.0x\nMarch 2019\nWorldpay / Fidelity National Information Services\n21.8x\nJanuary 2019\nFirst Data Corp / Fiserv\n12.0x\nNovember 2018\nApptio / Vista\nn/a*\nApril 2018\nFidessa / ION\n21.8x\n* Multiples that are negative or above 40x for EBITDA are considered not meaningful.\nBased upon the results of the selected precedent transactions analysis, Deutsche Bank calculated ranges of estimated implied value per share of\nBottomline\u2019s common stock by applying multiples of TEV/EBITDA of 20.0x to 24.0x to the Company\u2019s management estimates of last twelve months\nAdjusted EBITDA, resulting in a range of implied values of $42.49 to $51.01 per share of Bottomline\u2019s common stock.\nAdditional Informational Analysis\nDeutsche Bank observed certain additional information that, based on Deutsche Bank\u2019s professional judgment and experience, Deutsche Bank did not\nconsider to be part of its financial analysis with respect to its opinion but was noted for informational purposes, including the following:\nHistorical Trading Range Analysis\nDeutsche Bank performed a trading range analysis with respect to the historical share prices of Bottomline\u2019s common stock. Deutsche Bank noted that\nthe low and high prices per share of Bottomline\u2019s common stock during the 52-week period ending on December 15, 2021 were $36.49 and $54.39. As of\nDecember 15, 2021, the closing price per share of Bottomline\u2019s common stock was $50.36.\nDeutsche Bank noted that the trading range analysis was presented merely for reference purposes only, and was not relied upon for valuation purposes.\nWall Street Price Targets\nDeutsche Bank reviewed the stock price targets for Bottomline\u2019s common stock in several recently published, publicly available research analysts\u2019\nreports, which indicated low and high stock price targets ranging from $50.00 to $57.21 per share. Such range excluded publications after December 9,\n2021, the date Bloomberg reported that the Company was exploring a sale, to reflect unaffected stock price targets from research analysts.\n51\nTable of Contents\nDeutsche Bank noted that the analyst price targets were presented merely for reference purposes only, and were not relied upon for valuation purposes.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary is not a comprehensive description of all analyses performed and factors considered by Deutsche Bank in connection with\npreparing its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the application of subjective business judgment in\ndetermining the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and,\ntherefore, is not readily susceptible to a summary description. Deutsche Bank believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that\nconsidering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered without considering all analyses and factors could create a misleading view of\nthe process underlying the opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Deutsche Bank did not assign specific weights to any particular analyses.\nIn conducting its analyses and arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank utilized a variety of generally accepted valuation methods. The analyses were\nprepared solely for the purpose of enabling Deutsche Bank to provide its opinion to the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the\nholders of Bottomline\u2019s common stock, of the Per Share Merger Consideration. Analyses based on estimates or forecasts of future results are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual past or future values or results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses.\nBecause such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the Company or its\nadvisors, neither the Company nor Deutsche Bank nor any other person assumes responsibility if future results or actual values are materially different\nfrom these forecasts or assumptions.\nThe terms of the Merger were determined through negotiations between the Company and Parent and were approved by the Board of Directors.\nAlthough Deutsche Bank provided advice to the Board during the course of these negotiations, the decision to enter into the Merger was solely that of\nthe Board of Directors. As described above, the opinion and presentation of Deutsche Bank to the Board of Directors were only one of a number of\nfactors taken into consideration by the Board in making its determination to approve the Merger. Deutsche Bank\u2019s opinion was provided to the Board of\nDirectors to assist it in connection with its consideration of the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any holders of Bottomline\u2019s\ncommon stock as to how to vote on any matter.\nAdditional Information\nThe Board of Directors selected Deutsche Bank as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger based on Deutsche Bank\u2019s qualifications, expertise,\nreputation and experience in mergers and acquisitions. The Company has retained Deutsche Bank pursuant to an engagement letter dated as of\nSeptember 20, 2021, as amended. As compensation for Deutsche Bank\u2019s services in connection with the Merger, the Company has agreed to pay to\nDeutsche Bank the following fees:\n\u2022\nan opinion fee of $1,000,000, which became payable upon Deutsche Bank\u2019s delivery of its written opinion, dated as of December 17, 2021, to\nthe Company\u037e\n\u2022\na transaction fee contingent on the consummation of the Merger of approximately $25 million, equal to 0.95% of the value of the aggregate\nconsideration (as defined in the engagement letter), which is estimated to be approximately $2.6 billion as of December 14, 2021\u037e provided\nthat the transaction fee shall be reduced by the opinion fee described in the preceding bullet\u037e and\n\u2022\nif the transaction is not consummated and the Company or its subsidiaries are entitled to any payment (including, without limitation, a\nbreak-up fee, lock-up option, topping fee or other termination fee or any judgment or settlement in connection with a litigation or other\nproceeding related to the failure of the Merger) (which we refer to collectively as a \u201cTermination Fee\u201d), a fee equal to 20% of such\n52\nTable of Contents\nTermination Fee, net the Company\u2019s out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction and collection of such\nTermination Fee, at such time as such Termination Fee is received by the Company or its subsidiaries\u037e provided that the such fee shall not\nbe greater than the transaction fee shall be reduced by the amount of any previously paid opinion fee, without duplication of any other\noffset of such opinion fee.\nRegardless of whether the Merger is consummated, the Company has agreed to reimburse Deutsche Bank for reasonable and documented fees, expenses\nand disbursements of Deutsche Bank\u2019s counsel and all of Deutsche Bank\u2019s reasonable and documented travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred\nin connection with the Merger or otherwise arising out of the engagement of Deutsche Bank under the engagement letter provided that if such fees\nexceed $100,000 in the aggregate, such excess fees will only be reimbursed if incurred with the prior written consent of the Company. The Company has\nalso agreed to indemnify Deutsche Bank and certain related persons to the full extent lawful against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement or the\nMerger.\nDeutsche Bank is an internationally recognized investment banking firm experienced in providing advice in connection with mergers and acquisitions and\nrelated transactions. Deutsche Bank is an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG, which, together with its affiliates, are referred to in this proxy statement as the\nDB Group. One or more members of the DB Group have, from time to time, provided, and are currently providing, commercial banking (including extension\nof credit) and other financial services to Parent or its affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, compensation, including (i)\nacting as joint arranger for an entity affiliated with Thoma Bravo, L.P., an affiliate of Parent, on a debt financing transaction in February 2019, (ii) acting as\njoint bookrunner for an entity affiliated with Thoma Bravo, L.P. and lender on a debt financing transaction in November 2020, (iii) receiving deferred fees\nfrom an entity affiliated with Thoma Bravo, L.P. in June 2021 in connection with a SPAC initial public offering and (iv) acting as joint bookrunner for an\nentity affiliated with Thoma Bravo, L.P. on debt financing transactions in October 2020 and January, March, April, May and September 2021.

In the course of due diligence, the Company provided Thoma Bravo with the Financial Projections. The Financial\nProjections also were provided to Deutsche Bank which was directed to use and rely upon the Financial Projections for purposes of its financial analysis\nand fairness opinion as described above under \u201c\u2014Opinion of Bottomline\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d.\nThe Financial Projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by Company management at the time prepared, including with\nrespect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to the\nCompany.\nBottomline uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (which we refer to as\n\u201cGAAP\u201d) as supplemental measures to evaluate its operational performance. While Bottomline believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide\nuseful supplemental information, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures.

Although presented with numeric specificity, the Financial\nProjections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance and competition, general business, economic, market and\nfinancial conditions and matters specific to the Company\u2019s businesses, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s\ncontrol. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions underlying the Financial Projections will be realized.\nMany of the assumptions reflected in the Financial Projections are subject to change and the Financial Projections do not reflect revised prospects for\nthe Company\u2019s business, changes in general business or economic conditions or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and\nthat was not anticipated at the time such financial information was prepared. The Company has not updated and does not intend to update or otherwise\nrevise the Financial Projections. There can be no assurance that the results reflected in the Financial Projections will be realized or that actual results will\nnot materially vary from the Financial Projections. In\n54\nTable of Contents\naddition, the Financial Projections cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Therefore,\nthe Financial Projections included in this proxy statement should not be relied on as necessarily predictive of actual future events nor construed as\nfinancial guidance.\nBottomline shareholders are urged to review the Company\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to the Company\u2019s\nbusiness. You should read \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional information regarding the risks inherent in\nforward-looking information such as the Financial Projections and \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d.\nThe Financial Projections were not prepared with a view toward complying with GAAP (including because certain metrics are non-GAAP measures, and\nthe forecasts contained therein do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding\nprojections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective\nfinancial information. Neither the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled,\nexamined, or performed any procedures with respect to the Financial Projections, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on\nthe Financial Projections or the achievability of the results reflected in the Financial Projections, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any\nassociation with, the Financial Projections. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information\npresented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP measures such as those used in the Financial Projections may not be comparable to similarly titled\namounts used by other companies or persons.\nThe non-GAAP measures set forth above should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a\nbusiness combination transaction, such as the Financial Projections, are excluded from the definition of \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d under applicable\nSEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Financial Projections are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures,\nwhich would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Accordingly, no reconciliation of the\nfinancial measures included in the Financial Projections is provided in this proxy statement For the reasons described above, readers of this proxy\nstatement are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Financial Projections. The Company has not made any representation to Parent in the\nMerger Agreement concerning any of the Financial Projections.\nThe information about the Financial Projections set forth above does not give effect to the Merger and also does not take into account the effect of any\nfailure of the Merger to be consummated.\nTHE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE ABOVE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS TO REFLECT\nCIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT\nTHAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH FORECASTS ARE NOT REALIZED.\nInterests of Bottomline\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger",

The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters,\nin approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Bottomline\u2019s stockholders.\n55Table of Contents\nPhilip Hilal, a director of Bottomline, is also the Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Clearfield Capital Management LP. As of January 24, 2022, Mr.\nHilal beneficially owned 935,000 shares (approximately 2.1%) of Bottomline\u2019s common stock (which includes shares that Mr. Hilal may be deemed to\nbeneficially own by virtue of his positions at Clearfield Capital Management LP). As of January 24, 2022, Clearfield Capital Management LP beneficially\nowned 925,000 shares (approximately 2.1%) of Bottomline\u2019s common stock.\nTreatment of Equity-Based Awards\nThe Merger Agreement provides that immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time, (1) for any unvested restricted stock\naward or unvested restricted stock unit award the vesting of which is conditioned upon both time-based vesting and the attainment of performance\nconditions and that remains outstanding and subject to such performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of\nshares of Bottomline common stock subject to such unvested restricted stock award or unvested restricted stock unit award will be fixed at the Effective\nTime based upon the target level of performance, and (2) each outstanding unvested stock option and each outstanding unvested restricted stock award\nand unvested restricted stock unit award will be credited the Additional Vesting Credit. The Additional Vesting Credit includes the 12 months of \u201cchange\nin control\u201d accelerated vesting provided in Bottomline\u2019s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and is without limitation of any more favorable vesting\nprovisions in any other plan or agreement between Bottomline and any employee (described below for our named executive officers, where applicable).\nTreatment of Stock Options in the Merger\nAs of January 24, 2022, there were 1,051 outstanding options to acquire Bottomline common stock, all of which options were both vested and \u201cin-the-\nmoney,\u201d meaning that they have an exercise price less than $57.00 per share. Bottomline\u2019s directors and executive officers held none of such stock\noptions.

Each\nother outstanding restricted stock unit award will be converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i)\n$57.00, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such restricted stock unit award, which amount will, subject to the\nholder\u2019s continued service with Bottomline, Parent or an affiliate through the applicable vesting date and vest at the same time and on the same terms as\nthe restricted stock unit to which such cash amount relates would have vested pursuant to its terms (except that any applicable performance conditions\nwill be deemed to have been achieved at target levels and after giving effect to Additional Vesting Credit). Additionally, under Bottomline\u2019s 2019 Stock\nIncentive Plan, if the holder\u2019s employment is terminated other than for cause or by the holder for good reason within two years of the Effective Time, the\ncash amount to which such restricted stock unit award relates will immediately vest..\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, no new offering period or purchase period will be commenced following the date of the Merger Agreement under the\nESPP, and the offering period or purchase period in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement will be the final offering period or purchase period under\nthe Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Participants will not be permitted to increase the amount of their payroll deduction elections under the ESPP during\nthe final offering period or purchase period, and no new individuals will be permitted to commence participation in the ESPP prior to the Effective Time.\nThe ESPP will be terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nEquity Interests of Bottomline\u2019s Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors\nThe following table sets forth the number of shares of Bottomline common stock and the number of shares of Bottomline common stock underlying\nrestricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards that, as of January 24, 2022, were held by each of Bottomline\u2019s executive officers (including the\nnamed executive officers) and non-employee directors, in each case that either were then-currently vested or that will or may vest in connection with the\nMerger.

Under each of the\nagreements a change in control will occur upon the closing of the Merger. The following descriptions are qualified by reference to the full agreements as\npreviously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRobert A. Eberle Employment Agreement\nBottomline is party to an employment agreement with Mr. Eberle which provides for certain payments and benefits that will or may be payable upon or in\nconnection with the closing of the Merger. Under the employment agreement with Mr. Eberle, the closing of the Merger will constitute a \u201cchange in\ncontrol\u201d of Bottomline\u037e and the employment agreement provides that upon a change in control, Mr. Eberle\u2019s restricted stock awards will vest in full. The\nemployment agreement also provides that if Mr. Eberle\u2019s employment is terminated during a potential change in control (Bottomline\u2019s entry into the\nMerger Agreement resulted in such a potential change in control), either by Mr. Eberle as a result of an involuntary termination or by Bottomline without\ncause (in each case as defined in the employment agreement), all of his restricted stock awards will vest in full. In the event of such a termination either\nduring a potential change in control or following a change in control, Mr. Eberle will be entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment equal to three\ntimes the sum of (i) Mr. Eberle\u2019s then annual salary and (ii) the maximum amount of any bonus Mr. Eberle was eligible to earn for the then-current fiscal\nyear, as well as continuation of benefits for a period of 24 months. If Mr. Eberle is not continuing his employment with the Company following closing, he\nwill be entitled to these payments immediately prior to the closing.\nThe employment agreement also provides that, in the event of a change in control, Bottomline will pay any excise tax for which Mr. Eberle would be liable\nunder Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cCode\u201d), as a result of having received change in control related payments or benefits, as\nwell as the amount necessary to pay all additional taxes imposed on Mr. Eberle as a result of Bottomline\u2019s payment of the excise tax. No such additional\npayment is expected to be required in connection with the Merger.\nA. Bruce Bowden Retention Agreement\nBottomline is party to an executive retention agreement with Mr. Bowden. Under the terms of the retention agreement, if Mr. Bowden\u2019s employment is\nterminated by Bottomline other than for cause, disability or death or by Mr. Bowden for good reason (which definition includes his ceasing to serve as\nthe Chief Financial Officer of Bottomline as a standalone publicly traded company as a result of the change in control event, which will occur upon the\nclosing of the Merger), in either case, within 12 months following a change in control, then subject to Mr. Bowden\u2019s execution of a general release of\nclaims in favor of Bottomline, Mr. Bowden will receive severance in an amount equal to his base salary for the six months prior to the date of termination\nand an amount equal to 50% of his annual bonus opportunity for the most recently completed fiscal year. In connection with such termination of\nemployment, he will also be entitled (among other things) to payment of a pro-rated portion of his annual bonus opportunity for the fiscal year in which\ntermination of employment occurs and an amount equal to 50% of any commissions paid to him over the previous 12-month period, and all shares of\nrestricted stock and restricted stock units will vest in connection with such a termination (which vesting is not subject to the release of claims\nrequirement). If, following such a termination, Mr. Bowden timely elects and remains eligible for benefits continuation pursuant to federal COBRA laws,\nBottomline will pay any difference between\n58\nTable of Contents\nthe premiums for health continuation coverage and the amount for which Mr. Bowden would otherwise be responsible with respect to the medical and\ndental coverage elected until the earlier of 12 months after the date of termination and the date on which Mr. Bowden becomes covered under another\nemployer insurance plan that provides substantially similar in the aggregate or greater coverage than the Company\u2019s health plans.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, if Mr. Bowden remains employed by the Company at the time of the closing, he will be entitled to the Additional\nVesting Credit with respect to his outstanding equity awards as well as full vesting of his remaining unvested equity awards due to his having \u201cgood\nreason\u201d as of the effective date.\nBottomline is also party to an employment agreement with Mr. Bowden\u037e however, all payments and benefits payable in connection with the Merger would\nbe provided pursuant to Mr. Bowden\u2019s retention agreement described above.\nNorman J. DeLuca Employment Agreement\nBottomline is party to an employment agreement with Mr. DeLuca, which provides that any restricted stock granted to Mr. Deluca will vest in full upon a\nchange in control. In addition, if Mr. DeLuca\u2019s employment is terminated by Bottomline without cause, either before or after a change in control, he will be\nprovided six months\u2019 salary and benefits, and a lump sum payment equal to 50% of his annual bonus opportunity pursuant to Bottomline\u2019s severance\npractice with respect to senior executives.\nNigel K. Savory Service Agreement\nBottomline is party to a Service Agreement with Mr. Savory. The Service Agreement generally provides that during a transition period running from\nMarch 12, 2022 until June 1, 2023, either Bottomline or Mr. Savory may provide written notice that the working arrangement pursuant to the service\nagreement is either not working as desired or not one the party desires to continue, subject to certain exceptions in the case of Mr. Savory. In the event\nthat either Bottomline or Mr. Savory exercises its right to serve such notice (the \u201ctransition notice\u201d) during the transition period, then, subject to Mr.\nSavory\u2019s execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company, (i) Mr. Savory will be entitled to severance in the form of 12 months\u2019 base salary\ncontinuation (subject to certain offsets) and a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of the bonus paid to him in the 12 months prior to\nthe termination date multiplied by 0.5 and (ii) each outstanding equity award held by Mr. Savory as of the termination date will continue to vest until the\nearlier of (a) such time as it is vested in full in accordance with its terms, (b) the end of the period of 24 months following the termination date, during\nwhich period Mr. Savory agrees to provide services to Bottomline as a strategic adviser, (c) the date on which he commences alternative employment or\nengagement with another entity, subject to certain exceptions and (d) the date upon which he terminates, or materially breaches the terms of, the strategic\nadvisor agreement.\nIn addition, if Mr. Savory\u2019s employment terminates (i) following his receipt of a transition notice from Bottomline and (ii) within 12 months following a\nchange in control (and other than as a result of his death or disability), then each equity award held by him as of the termination date will immediately\nvest in full.\nUnder Mr. Savory\u2019s Service Agreement, if Bottomline terminates Mr. Savory\u2019s employment without cause (and other than as a result of Mr. Savory\u2019s\ndeath or disability) outside of the transition period (i.e., prior to March 12, 2022 or following June 1, 2023) regardless of whether such termination of\nemployment occurs before or after a change in control, then, subject to Mr. Savory\u2019s execution of a release of claims against the company, (i) Bottomline\nhas agreed to pay Mr. Savory severance in the form of 12 months\u2019 base salary continuation (subject to certain offsets) and a lump sum cash payment in\nan amount equal to the sum of the bonus paid in the 12 months prior to the termination date multiplied by 0.5 and (ii) all outstanding equity awards held\nby him as of the termination date will immediately vest in full.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, if Mr. Savory is employed by the Company at the time of the closing, he will be entitled to the Additional Vesting\nCredit with respect to his outstanding equity awards and full vesting of his\n59\nTable of Contents\nremaining unvested equity awards upon a qualifying termination of employment within two years of the effective date. If Mr. Savory is serving as a\nstrategic advisor at the time of closing, he will be entitled to the Additional Vesting Credit with respect to his outstanding equity awards.\nJohn F. Kelly Special Advisor and Transition Agreement\nBottomline is also party to a Special Advisor and Transition Agreement with Mr. Kelly, under which Mr. Kelly continues to serve as Special Advisor to\nBottomline following the termination of his employment that occurred on August 24, 2021, and pursuant to which his stock awards will continue to vest\nthrough August 24, 2022 and are thus entitled to the Additional Vesting Credit provided in the Merger Agreement, which will result in full vesting of his\nremaining awards.\nStock Incentive Plans\nIn addition to the change in control provisions in such individual employment arrangements, our stock incentive plans contain provisions that are\napplicable to all plan participants regarding the consequences of a \u201cChange in Control Event\u201d (which will occur upon the Effective Time). Generally, the\nplans provide that the vesting schedule of any unvested restricted stock award or restricted stock unit award would be accelerated in part such that what\nwould have otherwise become vested on any date within one year after the date of the Change in Control Event would immediately become vested.\nAdditionally, each unvested restricted stock award or restricted stock unit award would immediately become free from all vesting conditions or\nrestrictions if, on or prior to the second anniversary of the date of the consummation of the Change in Control Event, the plan participant\u2019s employment\nwith the Company or the acquiring or succeeding corporation is terminated for Good Reason (as defined in the applicable plan) by the participant or is\nterminated without Cause (as defined in the applicable plan) by the Company or the acquiring or succeeding corporation. Awards that vest in whole or in\npart based on specified performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at the target level upon the consummation of the Change in Control Event.\nAwards continue to be subject to their original service-based vesting requirements (if any) and be accelerated, as applicable, as described in the\npreceding two sentences of this paragraph. Such accelerated vesting provision will not apply to our outstanding stock options, all of which were fully\nvested as of January 24, 2022. In addition, all restricted stock awards held by our non-employee directors will immediately vest in full at closing given that\nsuch awards would otherwise vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The foregoing description is only a summary and is qualified by reference\nto the applicable plan.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nThis section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation that is based on or otherwise related to the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement for each of Bottomline\u2019s executive officers who were designated as \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d in\nBottomline Proxy Statement filed on October 21, 2021. This compensation is referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation by the applicable SEC\ndisclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the compensation and benefits related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement that will or may be payable to those named executive officers. The amounts set forth in the table below are based on multiple assumptions\nthat may or may not actually prove correct, including assumptions described in in the footnotes to the tables below. As a result, the actual amounts\nreceived by a named executive officer in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement may differ materially from the amounts\nset forth below.\nThe table below sets forth, for the purposes of this golden parachute disclosure, the amount of payments and benefits that each of Bottomline\u2019s named\nexecutive officers would receive, assuming that (i) the closing occurs on May 31, 2022 (which is the assumed closing date solely for purposes of this\ngolden parachute compensation disclosure)\u037e (ii) each of Bottomline\u2019s named executive officers is employed or providing services to Bottomline at the\nclosing and, to the extent employed, experiences a qualifying termination of employment immediately following the closing\u037e (iii) the unvested Bottomline\nrestricted shares outstanding as of May 31, 2022 become\n60\nTable of Contents\nfully vested as a result of either the occurrence of a \u201cchange in control\u201d or, for named executive officers who are employed at that time, a qualifying\ntermination\u037e (iv) no named executive officer receives any additional equity grants or retention awards on or prior to the closing\u037e and (v) no named\nexecutive officer enters into any new agreement or becomes entitled to, prior to the closing, additional compensation or benefits related to the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nName (1)\nCash\n($) (2)\nEquity\n($) (3)\nPerquisites/Benefits\n($) (4)\nTotal\n($)\nRobert A.

Although Richard D. Booth was a named executive officer in Bottomline\u2019s most recent proxy statement, he is no longer\nemployed by Bottomline and is not eligible to receive any compensation based on, or otherwise related to, the Merger.\n(2)\nExcept as indicated below, the amounts in this column represent the cash severance payments that would be payable to each named executive\nofficer upon a qualifying termination under their respective agreements in connection with the Merger, as described in more detail under \u201cInterests\nof Bottomline\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d The amounts in this column for Messrs. Eberle and Bowden are anticipated to be\npayable in connection with the closing on a \u201csingle trigger\u201d basis (i.e., such amounts are payable upon the change in control at closing). The\namounts for Mr. DeLuca are considered \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d (i.e., such amounts are payable upon a qualifying termination of employment following the\nclosing). The amount for Mr. Savory represents the amounts payable in connection with a delivery of the transition notice described above.

The value of Bottomline restricted stock is calculated by multiplying the number of\nshares subject to such Bottomline restricted stock by $57.00. The following table breaks down the amounts in this column by the number and value\nof awards that will vest upon application of the Additional Vesting Credit and the number and value of awards that will vest as a result of either\ncontractual single trigger vesting rights or in connection with a subsequent termination of employment (see columns entitled \u201cAdditional Shares\nVesting\u201d). For Messrs. Eberle, Bowden, DeLuca and Kelly, all of the displayed amounts (including those under \u201cAdditional Shares Vesting\u201d) are\nconsidered \u201csingle trigger\u201d as they vest upon a change in control, which change in control will occur upon the closing.

Mr. Kelly is not eligible for additional\nseverance or other payments in connection with the Merger in the event he remains Special Advisor to Bottomline through the closing date.\nIndemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers\nFor a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent has agreed that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from\nliabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time which were in existence as of the signing of the Merger Agreement in favor of\nthe current and former directors or officers of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries as provided in their respective governing or organizational documents\nand any indemnification or other similar agreements of Bottomline or certain of its subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of the Merger\nAgreement to continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, for a period of no less than six years from and after the Effective Time, and\nParent shall cause each of Bottomline and its subsidiaries to perform their obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the\nEffective Time and ending on the date that is the sixth anniversary of the closing date, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving\nCorporation has agreed that it will, indemnify and hold harmless each individual who was as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or who becomes prior\nto the Effective Time, a director or officer of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries, or who was as of the date of the Merger, or who thereafter commenced\nprior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person, against all claims,\nlosses, liabilities, damages, judgements, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, incurred in\nconnection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,\n62\nTable of Contents\nadministrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions and actions contemplated thereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of\nBottomline or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person,\nwhether asserted or claimed at, prior to or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the governing or organizational documents of\nBottomline and its subsidiaries and any indemnification or other similar agreements of Bottomline and any of its subsidiaries. In the event of any such\nclaim, action, suit or proceeding, such person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or\nproceeding from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation in effect on the date of the\nMerger Agreement\u037e provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or\nthe Surviving Corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such\nperson is not entitled to indemnification, and the Surviving Corporation will reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter.\nFor a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will either cause to be maintained in effect the current\npolicies of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for Bottomline and its\nsubsidiaries and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance coverage currently\nmaintained by Bottomline and its subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the\ninsured persons than the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries with respect to claims\narising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an \u201cA\u201d rating by A.M.

If the\nSurviving Corporation is unable to obtain such insurance coverage, it will obtain as much comparable insurance as possible within such six-year period\nfor a premium equal to such maximum amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the closing of the Merger, Bottomline may, at its option, purchase a \u201ctail\u201d\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policy for Bottomline and its subsidiaries and the insured persons who are currently covered by the directors\u2019\nand officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Bottomline and its subsidiaries, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than\nthe existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage\ncurrently maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time\u037e\nprovided that in no event will the cost of any such tail policy exceed the maximum amount described in the preceding sentence. Parent and the Surviving\nCorporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.\nExecutive Officers Following the Merger\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has entered into any new agreement or arrangement with Bottomline, Thoma Bravo\nor any of their affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its\naffiliates.",

            "text": "Appraisal Rights\nIf the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their\nshares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full\ntext of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not\nconstitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a\nholder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having a\nbeneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to\ncause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of our\ncommon stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the\nother nominee.\nUnder Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) continuously are the\nrecord holders of such shares through the Effective Time\u037e and (iii) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their\nshares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive in lieu of the Per Share Merger Consideration payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of\nthe shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be\npaid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its\ndiscretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time\nthrough the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during\nsuch period.\n64Table of Contents\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more\nthan, the same as or less than the Per Share Merger Consideration.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty days\nprior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of\nSection 262. This proxy statement constitutes Bottomline\u2019s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and\nthe full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who\nwishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with\nthe requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her\nor its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising\nthe right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, Bottomline believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder should\nseek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Bottomline a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose\nappraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair\nvalue of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no\nintention of doing so.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by\nproxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Bottomline, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the\nappraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A holder\nof shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must\ncontinue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked,\nbe voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any\npreviously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit\na proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement.\nNeither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal\nmust be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement will not\n65\nTable of Contents\nconstitute a demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the\nSpecial Meeting of Bottomline\u2019s stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for\nappraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Bottomline of the\nidentity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the Merger. If the shares\nare owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record\nowner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by\nor on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on\nbehalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent\nis acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO\nEXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A\nPERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER\nOR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE\nSTEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nBottomline Technologies, Inc.\n325 Corporate Drive\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire 03801\nAttention: Eric Morgan, Executive Vice President, Global Controller\nAny holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement by delivering to Bottomline a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal within 60 days after the Effective Time . However, any such\nattempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal\nproceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be\nconditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within ten days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of shares of common stock who has\nmade a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement that the Merger\nhas become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with\nSection 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery, with a copy served on\n66\nTable of Contents\nthe Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all\nstockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should\nnot assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of common stock.\nAccordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their\nappraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of common\nstock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights, or\na beneficial owner of shares held in either a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from\nthe Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with\nrespect to which Bottomline has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must\nmail this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the\nexpiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee\non behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing\nstatements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the\nSurviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list\ncontaining the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their\nshares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a\nhearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights\nthereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the\nRegister in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of\ncommon stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid\nupon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.\nUnless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the\njudgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time\nto time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware\ndiscussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or\nmethods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air\nprice obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this\ndetermination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other\nfacts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that\nfair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc.,\nthe Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow\n67\nTable of Contents\nexclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d In addition, the\nDelaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder\u2019s\nexclusive remedy.\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could\nbe more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that\nan opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to,\nand does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Bottomline believes that the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, no\nrepresentation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should\nrecognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Merger Consideration.\nNeither Bottomline nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each\nof Bottomline and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of common\nstock is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of\nthe appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including,\nwithout limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be\nappraised.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws,\nsuch holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to\nreceive the Per Share Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition\nfor appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the\nholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of common stock for any\npurpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of common\nstock, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time\nor thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for\nappraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder who commenced\nthe proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights.\nConsequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",

EACH\nHOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE\nMERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR\nFOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION OR ANY NON-INCOME TAX LAWS.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock of Bottomline that is for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes:\n\u2022\na citizen or individual resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof\nor the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more\nUnited States persons (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust\u037e or\n(2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and\nthe U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount\nthat such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S.\nHolder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. A reduced tax rate generally will apply to long-\nterm capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder\nacquired different blocks of common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or\nloss separately with respect to each block of common stock.\nA U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding in connection with the Merger. Certain U.S. Holders are exempt from\nbackup withholding, including corporations and certain tax exempt organizations. A U.S. Holder will be subject to backup withholding if such holder fails\nto demonstrate an exemption and such holder:\n\u2022\nfails to furnish the holder\u2019s taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is ordinarily his or her social security number\u037e\n\u2022\nfurnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number\u037e or\n\u2022\nfails to certify under penalties of perjury that the holder has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the holder is not\nsubject to backup withholding.\nIf a holder does not provide such holder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification number or fails to provide the required certifications, the IRS may impose\npenalties on such holder, and the gross proceeds payable to such holder\n70\nTable of Contents\npursuant to the Merger may be subject to backup withholding at a rate currently equal to 24%. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts\nwithheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the\nrequired information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIn general, any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by\nan applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in\nwhich case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis at the rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and,\nif the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an\napplicable income tax treaty)\u037e or\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year in which the Merger is\nconsummated, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of\n30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty), net of applicable U.S.-source capital losses recognized by such Non-U.S. Holder.\nPayments made to Non-U.S. Holders in the Merger may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding. Non-U.S. Holders generally can\navoid backup withholding and information reporting by providing the paying agent with the applicable and properly executed IRS Form W-8 (or an\nappropriate substitute or successor form) certifying the holder\u2019s non-U.S. status or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information returns\nthat are filed with the IRS may also be made available under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the\ncountry in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or credit against a\nNon-U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nNon-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to any applicable tax treaties that might provide for different rules.\nTHE FOREGOING SUMMARY DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO\nPARTICULAR HOLDERS. HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO\nTHEM OF THE RECEIPT OF CASH FOR THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER UNDER ANY U.S. FEDERAL,\nSTATE, FOREIGN, LOCAL OR OTHER TAX LAWS, OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

These approvals include (i) the\nexpiration or early termination of the\n71Table of Contents\napplicable waiting period under the HSR Act\u037e and (ii) approval of the change in control relating to Bottomline Payment Services Limited (a U.K.-based\nsubsidiary of Bottomline) by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom.\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until Bottomline and Parent file a notification and report form\nwith the FTC and the DOJ under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR\nAct may not be completed until the expiration of waiting period following the parties\u2019 filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms (typically a 30-\nday period) or the early termination of that waiting period. Bottomline and Parent made the necessary filings with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of\nthe DOJ on December 30, 2021. The required waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on January\n31, 2022. Accordingly, the condition of the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act as described below under the\ncaption \u201c\u2014Conditions to the Closing of the Merger\u201d has been satisfied.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ\ncould take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable statutes, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the\nMerger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing\nrelationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period\nunder the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or\nterminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain\ncircumstances.\nU.K. Change in Control Matters\nBottomline Payment Services Limited (a U.K. based subsidiary of Bottomline) is authorized and regulated by the FCA. Accordingly, any person who will\nacquire a \u201cqualifying holding\u201d in Bottomline Payment Services Limited as a result of the consummation of the Merger, which will include Parent and other\nmembers of its group, will require approval from the FCA for the change in control.\nParent submitted a change in control application with the FCA on January 20, 2022. Following submission of the change in control application by,\namongst others, the Parent, the FCA has 60 working days (or up to 90 working days if the FCA require further information) to decide either to (i) approve\nthe Merger unconditionally\u037e (ii) approve the Merger subject to conditions, for instance, preventing Parent or a connected party from taking up\ndirectorships and from exercising their voting powers over certain matters related to Bottomline Payment Services Limited\u037e or (iii) object to the Merger\nentirely. However, over the past year such applications have been experiencing increasingly severe delays and the FCA may take many weeks before it\nacknowledges receipt of the completed application and allocates it to a case officer for review\u037e the statutory review period set out above will only\ncommence thereafter.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nOne or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals\nand consents. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which\nactions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to\nobtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial period of time\nbetween the approval by Bottomline\u2019s stockholders and the completion of the Merger.\n72\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and\napprovals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of\nadditional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.\nLegal Proceedings Regarding the Merger",

The rights and obligations\nof the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy\nstatement. Capitalized terms used in this section but not defined in this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made only for purposes of\nthe Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (3) may be subject to\nimportant qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Bottomline, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the Merger Agreement.

liability company (\u201cParent\u201d), and Project RB Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d).\nWHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to effect the Merger, pursuant to which Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the\nCompany, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement\u037e\nWHEREAS, the Company Board and the board of directors of Merger Sub have unanimously approved and declared advisable, and each of the\nboard of managers of Parent and Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub has approved or adopted, this Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated hereby, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement and in accordance\nwith the DGCL\u037e\nWHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties,

The date on which the Closing occurs is\nreferred to in this Agreement as the \u201cClosing Date.\u201d\nSection 1.03 Effective Time. Concurrently with the Closing, the parties shall file with the Delaware Secretary the certificate of merger relating to the\nMerger (the \u201cCertificate of Merger\u201d), in customary form and substance, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL.

The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.\nSection 1.05 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the\nMerger and without any further action, be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth on Exhibit A and, as so amended and restated, shall be\nthe certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to\nSection 6.04(a). The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until\nthereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to Section 6.04(a), except that references to the name of Merger Sub\nshall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Corporation.\nSection 1.06 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the\ndirectors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and\nqualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until\nthe earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.\nARTICLE II\nEFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES\u037e EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES\nSection 2.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,\nMerger Sub or any holder of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d) or shares of common\nstock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the \u201cMerger Sub Common Stock\u201d):\n(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the\nEffective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation\nwith the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving\nCorporation, other than shares of the Surviving Corporation issued pursuant to Section 2.01(b)(ii). From and after the Effective Time, all certificates\nrepresenting shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving\nCorporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n(b) Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock\u037e Conversion of Subsidiary-Owned Stock.\n(i) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall\nno longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.\n(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Company Subsidiary or any direct or\nindirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of Merger Sub shall be converted into such number of shares of common\nstock of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following\nthe Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nA-2\nTable of Contents\n(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.02 and 2.03, each share of Company Common Stock issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled or converted into shares of the Surviving Corporation in\naccordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive $57.00 in cash, without interest (the \u201cMerger\nConsideration\u201d). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and\nshall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any\nsuch shares of Company Common Stock (each, a \u201cCertificate\u201d) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration. Without limiting the restrictions set forth in Section 5.01, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding\nshares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,\nsubdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number or\namount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and\nthe holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.\nSection 2.02 Exchange of Certificates\u037e Payment Fund.\n(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its sole cost and expense, appoint a bank, trust or transfer agent company\nreasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d) for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration.\nImmediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, for\npayment in accordance with this Article II through the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable\npursuant to Section 2.01(c) (other than any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares). All such cash deposited with the Paying Agent is\nhereinafter referred to as the \u201cPayment Fund.\u201d\n(b) Letter of Transmittal. As reasonably promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days\nafter the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock (other than the Company, its\nSubsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub) a form of letter of transmittal (the \u201cLetter of Transmittal\u201d) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and\nrisk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall be in such form and have such other\nprovisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent\nmay specify subject to the Company\u2019s reasonable approval, and shall be prepared prior to the Closing), together with instructions thereto.\n(c) Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. Upon (i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by\na Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly\nexecuted in accordance with the instructions thereto, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an\n\u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the Paying Agent, in each case together with such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the\nholder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have\nbeen converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer\nrecords of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock (or, if such\nCompany Common Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents\nrequired to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until\nsurrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each share of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at\nany time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holders of\nA-3\nTable of Contents\nshares of Company Common Stock are entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01(c). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue\non the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form).\n(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II\nupon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to\nsuch shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books\nof the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective\nTime, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are\npresented to Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.\n(e) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains\nundistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee, and any\nholder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a\ngeneral unsecured creditor thereof for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.\n(f) No Liability. None of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective Affiliates (including Sponsor\nand its Affiliates) shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable\nabandoned property, escheat or similar Law.\n(g) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent\u037e provided, that\nsuch investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the\nLaw of a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Service,\nrespectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers\u2019 acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or\nin mutual funds investing in such assets. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent.\nNo investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any of the Company\u2019s shareholders to receive the\nMerger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there are losses with respect to such investments or the Payment Fund\ndiminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to\nSection 2.01(c), Parent shall reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times\nmaintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.\n(h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and their Affiliates, as\napplicable (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such\namounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and\nduly paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of\nwhich such deduction or withholding was made.\n(i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance\nreasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent, the posting\nof such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to\nsuch Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect\nthereof pursuant to this Agreement.\nA-4\nTable of Contents\n(j) No Further Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation\nwith a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or shares in book-entry form.\nSection 2.03 Dissenting Shares.\n(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights\nunder Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder\nwho has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the \u201cDissenting Shares\u201d), shall not be\nconverted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

            "text": "Annex B\nDecember 17, 2021\nBoard of Directors\nBottomline Technologies, Inc.\n325 Corporate Drive\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire 03801\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nDeutsche Bank Securities Inc. (\u201cDeutsche Bank\u201d) has acted as financial advisor to Bottomline Technologies, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) in connection with the\nAgreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 16, 2021 (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), by and among the Company, Project RB Parent, LLC (\u201cParent\u201d),\nand Project RB Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), which provides, among other things, for the merger of Merger Sub\nwith and into the Company, as a result of which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). As set forth more\nfully in the Merger Agreement, as a result of the Transaction, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d), of\nthe Company, other than dissenting shares and shares owned directly or indirectly by the Company or Parent, will be converted into the right to receive\n$57.00 in cash (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d).\nYou have requested our opinion, as investment bankers, as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of\nthe outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.\nIn connection with our role as financial advisor to the Company, and in arriving at our opinion, we reviewed certain publicly available financial and other\ninformation concerning the Company, and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to the Company prepared by\nmanagement of the Company. We have also held discussions with certain senior officers and other representatives and advisors of the Company\nregarding the businesses and prospects of the Company. In addition, we have (i) reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company\nCommon Stock, (ii) compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies we\nconsidered relevant whose securities are publicly traded, (iii) reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business\ncombinations which we deemed relevant, (iv) reviewed the Merger Agreement, and (v) performed such other studies and analyses and considered such\nother factors as we deemed appropriate.\nWe have not assumed responsibility for independent verification of, and have not independently verified, any information, whether publicly available or\nfurnished to us, concerning the Company, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in connection with the rendering of our\nopinion. Accordingly, for purposes of our opinion, we have, with your knowledge and permission, assumed and relied upon the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all such information. We have not conducted a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and have not prepared, obtained\nor reviewed any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance-sheet assets or\nliabilities), of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company under any law relating to\nbankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. With respect to the financial forecasts made available to us and used in our analyses (the \u201cForecasts\u201d), we\nhave assumed with your knowledge and permission that such Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby. In rendering our opinion, we express no view as to the\nreasonableness of such Forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they are based. Our opinion is necessarily based upon economic, market\nand other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. We expressly disclaim any undertaking or obligation\nto advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting our opinion of which we become aware after the date hereof.\nFor purposes of rendering our opinion, we have assumed with your knowledge and permission that, in all respects material to our analysis, the\nTransaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the\nB-1Table of Contents\nMerger Agreement, without any waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement that would be material to our analysis. We also\nhave assumed with your knowledge and permission that all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection\nwith the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or other\napprovals and consents, no restrictions, terms or conditions will be imposed that would be material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or\naccounting experts and have relied on the assessments made by the Company and its other advisors with respect to such issues.\nThis opinion has been approved and authorized for issuance by a Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review committee and is addressed to, and is for the\nuse and benefit of, the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion is\nlimited to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the date hereof. This\nopinion does not address any other terms of the Transaction or the Merger Agreement. You have not asked us to, and this opinion does not, address the\nfairness of the Transaction, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of the Company, nor does it address the fairness of the contemplated benefits of the Transaction. We express no opinion as to the merits\nof the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative\ntransactions or business strategies. Nor do we express an opinion, and this opinion does not constitute a recommendation, as to how any holder of\nshares of Company Common Stock should vote with respect to the Transaction. In addition, we do not express any view or opinion as to the fairness,\nfinancial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the Company\u2019s officers, directors, or\nemployees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction relative to the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of\nCompany Common Stock.\nDeutsche Bank will be paid a fee for its services as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which becomes\npayable upon delivery of this opinion (or would have become payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Board of Directors that it was unable to render\nthis opinion) and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. The Company has also agreed to reimburse\nDeutsche Bank for its expenses, and to indemnify Deutsche Bank against certain liabilities, in connection with its engagement. We are an affiliate of\nDeutsche Bank AG (together with its affiliates, the \u201cDB Group\u201d). One or more members of the DB Group have, from time to time, provided, and are\ncurrently providing, commercial banking (including extension of credit) and other financial services to Parent or its affiliates for which they have received,\nand in the future may receive, compensation, including (i) acting as joint arranger for Thoma Bravo LLC, an affiliate of Parent, on a debt financing\ntransaction in February 2019, (ii) acting as joint bookrunner for Thoma Bravo LLC and lender on a debt financing transaction in November 2020, (iii)\nreceiving deferred fees from Thoma Bravo LLC in June 2021 in connection with a SPAC initial public offering and (iv) acting as joint bookrunner for\nThoma Bravo LLC on debt financing transactions in October 2020 and January, March, April, May and September 2021. In addition, the DB Group may\nalso provide investment and commercial banking services to Parent and the Company in the future, for which we would expect the DB Group to receive\ncompensation. In the ordinary course of business, members of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of\nParent, the Company and their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Accordingly, the DB Group may at any\ntime hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments and obligations.\nBased upon and subject to the foregoing assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions, it is Deutsche Bank\u2019s opinion as investment bankers\nthat, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock.\nVery truly yours,\nDEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES INC.\nB-2\nTable of Contents\nAnnex C",

If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth\nin subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.\n(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\n(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a\nmeeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on\nthe record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with \u00a7 255(c) of this title) with respect to\nshares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or\nall of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent\ncorporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such\nstockholder\u2019s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for\nappraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed\nto an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it\nreasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing\nto take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or\nconsolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with\nthis subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has\nbecome effective\u037e or\n(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \u00a7 228, \u00a7 251(h), \u00a7 253, or \u00a7 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation\nbefore the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each\nof the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the\nmerger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent\ncorporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a\ncopy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such\nstockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the\ndate of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the\noffer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or\nresulting corporation the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic\ntransmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand\nwill be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to\ndemand the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal\nrights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all\nsuch holders on or within 10 days after such effective date\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days\nfollowing the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the\nconsummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice\nneed only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to\nC-2\nTable of Contents\nappraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary\nor assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall,\nin the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive\neither notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice\nis given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such\neffective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on\nthe day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.\n(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has\ncomplied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal\nproceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,\nany stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by\nelectronic transmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall\nbe entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number\nof shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate\nnumber of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in \u00a7 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and\naccepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have\nbeen received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such\nstockholder\u2019s request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for\ndelivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a\nperson who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such\nperson\u2019s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which\nshall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the\nnames and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares\nhave not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition\nshall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed\nfor the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at\nthe addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper\nof general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by\nmail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.\n(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled\nto appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by\ncertificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and\nif any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the\nC-3\nTable of Contents\nproceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent\ncorporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all\nholders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the\noutstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such\ntotal number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of\nthe Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the\nfair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together\nwith interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all\nrelevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest\nfrom the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger\nand the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each\nstockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the\ndifference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued,\nunless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal\nproceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an\nappraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section\nand who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all\nproceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the\nstockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the\ncase of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court\u2019s\ndecree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a\ncorporation of this State or of any state.\n(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances.\nUpon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the\nappraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against\nthe value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.\n(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection\n(d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock\n(except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if\nsuch stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an\nacceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e)\nof this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of\nthe Court, and such approval\nC-4\nTable of Contents\nmay be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just\u037e provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal\nand to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth\nin subsection (e) of this section.\n(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they\nassented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nC-5\nTable of Contents\nAnnex D\nEXECUTION VERSION",
