Because the required vote for\nthe proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is based on the number of votes our stockholders are entitled to cast\nrather than on the number of votes actually cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy or vote online at the meeting, abstain\nfrom voting at the meeting, or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as\nvotes cast \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. As of December 30, 2021, the Record Date for the Special Meeting,\n30,782,062 shares constitute a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock.\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal each require the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the voting power of the shares present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and\nentitled to vote on the subject matter. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory (non-binding) and is\nnot a condition to the completion of the Merger.\nAn abstention represents a stockholder\u2019s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder\nabstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal\nto adopt the Merger. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the\nAdjournment Proposal but will be used to determine whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. As a result,\nan abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or\nabsence of a quorum, but will only count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger.\nEach \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will\nhave no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d generally occurs\nwhen a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank,\nbroker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares.\n\u201cBroker non-votes,\u201d if any, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However,\nbecause none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have\ndiscretionary authority to vote, Arena does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. As such, if you\nfail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted towards\na quorum at the Special Meeting.",

For example,\nif you own 100 shares of common stock, you will receive $10,000.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of\ncommon stock, subject to any withholding of taxes. You will not receive any shares of the capital stock in the\nSurviving Corporation.\nQ:\nWhat will holders of Arena stock awards receive if the Merger is consummated?\nA:\nAt the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, each:\n(i)\nArena Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested,\nwill be cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and converted into the right to receive an\namount in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-\nshare exercise price of such Arena Option, multiplied by (2) the number of shares then subject to such\nArena Option\u037e\n(ii)\nArena RSU, except as described in subclause (iii) below, subject to vesting conditions based solely on\ncontinued employment or service to Arena or any of its subsidiaries that is unvested and outstanding as of\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and\nconverted into the right to receive an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the Merger Consideration\u037e\n(iii) 2022 Arena RSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be\nsubstituted automatically with an Adjusted RSU that is equal to the product of (1) the total number of\nshares subject to the 2022 Arena RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Arena\nRSU Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share. Each Adjusted RSU\nwill otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such 2022 Arena RSU immediately\nprior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms, and subject to accelerated vesting in connection with\ncertain qualifying terminations of employment following the Effective Time)\u037e and\n(iv) Arena PRSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be\ncancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and converted into the right to receive an amount in\ncash equal to the Merger Consideration (with all the performance-based vesting conditions associated with\nsuch Arena PRSU being deemed achieved at the greater of actual completed performance at the Effective\nTime or at target).\nFor more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the\nMerger Agreement-Merger Consideration-Treatment of Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena PRSUs.\u201d\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. In order to complete the Merger, Arena\nmust obtain the Requisite Vote described in this proxy statement, and the other closing conditions under the\nMerger Agreement must be satisfied or waived. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions,\nincluding obtaining the Requisite Vote, Arena is currently targeting to consummate the Merger in the first half of\n2022, although Arena cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. Since the Merger is subject to a\nnumber of conditions, the exact timing of the Merger cannot be determined at this time.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,\nstockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Arena will remain an\nindependent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered\nunder the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified\ncircumstances, Arena will be required to pay Pfizer the Arena Termination Fee upon the termination of the\nMerger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the\nMerger Agreement-Effect of Termination\u037e Termination Fees.\u201d\n1\n1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding\nas of the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed\nproxy card\u037e (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed\nproxy card)\u037e or (iii) vote virtually at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a quorum is present at\nthe Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have\nthe same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at\nthe Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement.\nQ:\nWhy are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation\nProposal?\nA:\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Arena to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote\nwith respect to certain payments that may be paid or could become payable to certain of its named executive\nofficers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or\nappropriate?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting is required to\napprove the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, and the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with\nrespect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Arena. Therefore, if the\nother requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable under the\nCompensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Arena\u2019s named executive officers in accordance with the\nterms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\nQ:\nWhat is a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d?\nA:\nUnder the rules of Nasdaq, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d for\ncustomers have the authority to vote on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d proposals when they have not received instructions\nfrom beneficial owners. However, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are precluded from exercising their\nvoting discretion with respect to approving non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares of\nArena common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not empowered to vote those shares of\nArena common stock on non-discretionary matters, which we refer to generally as \u201cbroker non-votes.\u201d Because\nnone of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have\ndiscretionary authority to vote, Arena does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,\nincluding, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this\nproxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects\nyou. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply\nenvelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided\nin the enclosed proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek\nappraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the\nvoting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.\n12\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nMay I exercise dissenters\u2019 rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nYes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the\nDGCL. Under Delaware law, stockholders of record who continuously hold shares of common stock through the\nEffective Time and do not vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to seek appraisal\nof the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed.\nAppraisal rights will only be available to stockholders who properly deliver, and do not properly withdraw, a\nwritten demand for an appraisal to Arena prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the\nSpecial Meeting and who comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL,\nwhich are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less\nthan the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A copy of\nSection 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement. For additional information, please see\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Appraisal Rights.\u201d\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. A letter of transmittal will be mailed to you promptly, and in any event within three (3) business days, after\nthe Effective Time, describing how you should surrender your shares of common stock for the Merger\nConsideration. If your shares of Arena common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your bank, brokerage firm or\nother nominee, you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee as to how to effect\nthe surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares of Arena common stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration.\nPlease do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I have lost my stock certificate?\nA:\nIf you have lost your stock certificate, please contact our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., at\n(800) 962-4284 or web.queries@computershare.com to obtain replacement certificates.\nQ:\nShould I surrender my book-entry shares now?\nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, the payment agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and\nwritten instructions that explain how to exchange shares of common stock represented by such holder\u2019s book-\nentry shares for Merger Consideration.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the\nSpecial Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger\nis expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before\nthe Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the\nperson to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Arena in writing of such\nspecial arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed,\nto the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the\nSpecial Meeting. You will also lose the ability to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger with\nrespect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the\nRecord Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply\nenvelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in\nthe enclosed proxy card).\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A.,\nyou are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this proxy\nstatement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Arena.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of\nshares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by\nyour bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrecord. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote\nyour shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting.\nHowever, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares virtually at the Special\nMeeting.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to\nbe considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You\nshould follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without\ninstructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted\nagainst adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or\nAdjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nHow may I vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with\nComputershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:\n\u2022\nby signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope\u037e\n\u2022\nby visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the Special Meeting virtually and voting at the meeting.\nA control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your\nshares of common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting\nelectronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).\nPlease be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the\nInternet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will\nbe responsible.\nEven if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of\ncommon stock by proxy.

            "text": "Record Date\u037e Shares Entitled to Vote\u037e Quorum\nOnly stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the\nSpecial Meeting. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal\nexecutive offices located at 136 Heber Avenue, Suite 204, Park City, Utah 84060, during regular business hours for a\nperiod of no less than ten (10) days before the Special Meeting and will be available electronically at the Special\nMeeting.\nThe holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present virtually or\nrepresented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 61,564,122\nshares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, meaning that 30,782,062 shares of\ncommon stock must be represented virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting to have a quorum. In the event that a\nquorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional\nproxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nVote Required\u037e Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding as of\nthe Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. As of the Record Date, 30,782,062 shares constitute a\nmajority of the outstanding shares of common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders is a\ncondition to the Closing.\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting is required to approve\nthe Compensation Proposal, on an advisory (non-binding) basis.\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting is required to approve\nthe Adjournment Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.\nAn abstention represents a stockholder\u2019s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder\nabstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal\nto adopt the Merger Agreement. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or\nAdjournment Proposal but will be used to determine whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. As a result,\nan abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or\nabsence of a quorum, but will only count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger.\nEach \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will\nhave no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any Adjournment Proposal. A \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d generally occurs\nwhen a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank,\nbroker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the\n17TABLE OF CONTENTS\nshares. \u201cBroker non-votes,\u201d if any, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.\nHowever, because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers\nmay have discretionary authority to vote, Arena does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. As\nsuch, if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, your shares will not be\ncounted towards a quorum at the Special Meeting.\nShares Held by Arena\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\nAs of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the\naggregate, 107,992 shares of common stock, representing approximately 0.18% of the shares of common stock\noutstanding on the Record Date (and approximately 2.98% of the shares of common stock outstanding when taking\ninto account Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena PRSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive\nofficers).\nOur directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their respective shares\nof common stock (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the approval, on an advisory (non-\nbinding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal, and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.\nVoting of Proxies",

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Board of Directors, together with Arena senior management, and with the assistance of its outside advisors,\nfrequently reviews Arena\u2019s strategic and financial alternatives in light of developments in Arena\u2019s business, the\nsectors in which it operates, and the economy and financial markets generally, as they, individually and together, may\naffect Arena\u2019s long-term strategic goals and plans. Since early 2020, this assessment has also been informed by the\ncurrent and prospective impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of new variants of the\ncoronavirus that causes COVID-19. As part of this process, members of Arena\u2019s senior management have engaged in\nbusiness development and strategic discussions with participants in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries,\nall with the goal of enhancing value for stockholders, including by delivering the best possible treatments and\nservices to patients and healthcare providers. Arena\u2019s strategic discussions have focused on, among other things,\nstrategic opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions, licensing transactions, commercial agreements and\nother financial and strategic alternatives for Arena, including continuing as a standalone company, with a view to\nenhance stockholder value.\nOn October 22, 2021, Mr. Amit D. Munshi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Arena, and Dr. Albert Bourla,\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer, held a video conference that had been scheduled earlier that week at\nthe request of Dr. Bourla. Dr. Bourla stated that Pfizer would be interested in acquiring Arena and would be prepared\nto execute a transaction by the end of the quarter but did not preview any valuation information. During the call, Dr.\nBourla requested that Arena provide any available data for its ongoing ELEVATE UC-12 trial and ELEVATE UC- 52\ntrials that might inform Pfizer's proposal. Mr. Munshi responded that only blinded data would be available before the\nend of the year. Dr. Bourla concluded the conversation by noting that he would follow up with Mr. Munshi as soon\nas possible. Later that day, Mr. Munshi informed Dr. Garry Neil, Chairman of the Board of Directors, of his\nconversation with Dr. Bourla.\nOn October 27, 2021, Dr. Bourla indicated to Mr. Munshi that it was challenging for Pfizer to make a written proposal\nbefore reviewing the blinded ELEVATE UC-12 and ELEVATE UC-52 data. Dr. Bourla asked whether Arena would\nprovide the information if Pfizer submitted a written letter of intent, exclusive of any price per share or other\n22TABLE OF CONTENTS\nvaluation information. Mr. Munshi stated that Arena would not do so. Dr. Bourla asked Mr. Munshi to identify a price\nthat would be sufficient for Arena to provide the requested information. Mr. Munshi declined to do so and indicated\nthat he believed any proposal would need to be substantially higher than the 52-week intraday high of the trading\nprice for shares of Arena common stock (which was $90.19 for the 52-week period ending October 27, 2021) in order\nto be considered by the Board of Directors. Dr. Bourla indicated that Pfizer would send a written proposal to Arena\nthe next day. Mr. Munshi confirmed that he would notify the Board of Directors of receipt of such written proposal.\nOn October 28, 2021, Pfizer sent Arena an indication of interest, dated October 27, 2021, pursuant to which Pfizer\nproposed to acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock of Arena for $98.00 per share in cash (which we refer to\nas the \u201cOctober 27 Proposal\u201d).\nOn October 29, 2021, Mr. Munshi informed Dr. Bourla that the Board of Directors would meet later that day to discuss\nthe October 27 Proposal. Mr. Munshi and Dr. Bourla discussed the appropriate contacts at Arena and Pfizer to\ncoordinate the negotiation and execution of a non-disclosure agreement if authorized by the Board of Directors.\nLater that day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of Cooley\nLLP (\u201cCooley\u201d), Arena\u2019s outside legal counsel. During the meeting, Mr. Munshi described his conversations with Dr.\nBourla and the October 27 Proposal. Representatives from Cooley summarized fiduciary duties attendant to any\nreview of strategic alternatives, and Mr. Munshi reviewed a summary of certain publicly available financial\ninformation prepared by Guggenheim Securities (from which no representatives were present at the meeting)\nregarding certain similar acquisition transactions. The Board of Directors and Arena senior management then\ndiscussed the price proposed by Pfizer in the October 27 Proposal and how it compared to premiums previously paid\nby Pfizer and to premiums paid in similar recent pre-commercial biopharmaceutical transactions. The Board of\nDirectors also discussed the inherent uncertainties in Arena\u2019s business as a standalone company (including those\nrelating to the ELEVATE UC-12 and ELEVATE UC-52 trials expected to read out in 2022), the premium to Arena\u2019s\ncurrent stock price represented by the price proposed in the October 27 Proposal and considerations for assessing\nstrategic alternatives at that time, including the need for an assessment of Arena\u2019s standalone plan and future\noutlook in order to assess the relative merits of Arena continuing to operate independently and pursuing its current\nbusiness and financial plans on a standalone basis. The Board of Directors also noted that a draft of Arena\u2019s Long\nRange Plan was scheduled to be reviewed by the Board of Directors the following week. Based on the discussion at\nthis meeting, the Board of Directors determined that although it would expect to seek to negotiate a higher price per\nshare if it were to consider entering into a transaction with Pfizer, it was advisable to permit Pfizer to proceed with\nlimited due diligence in order to allow it to improve its proposal. Accordingly, the Board of Directors approved\nentering into a non-disclosure agreement with Pfizer and providing limited diligence through a management\npresentation, including a summary of the blinded ELEVATE UC-12 and ELEVATE UC-52 data requested by Dr. Bourla.\nThe Board of Directors further directed Arena senior management to update and finalize Arena\u2019s Long Range Plan for\nreview by the Board of Directors at its next meeting.\nAt this meeting, the Board of Directors also discussed the potential benefits and risks associated with contacting\nadditional third parties regarding interest in a potential transaction with Arena and which third parties could\nreasonably be expected to have both financial ability and strategic interest in a potential transaction with Arena,\nincluding third parties that previously expressed interest in Arena\u2019s business. The Board of Directors determined to\nproceed with initial, preliminary outreach to selected third parties and authorized Arena senior management to\ncontact Party A, a pharmaceutical company, at that time. The Board of Directors discussed reaching out to Party B,\nanother pharmaceutical company, and determined based on recent discussions that because Party B was more\ninterested in a collaboration agreement than a potential transaction to acquire Arena, it would not be advisable to\nreach out to Party B. The Board of Directors also directed Arena senior management to prepare additional information\nregarding third parties that could potentially be contacted for further discussion at a subsequent meeting.\nLater that day, following the Board of Directors meeting, Mr. Vincent Aurentz, Executive Vice President and Chief\nBusiness Officer of Arena, contacted representatives of Party A to inquire as to whether Party A would have interest\nin acquiring Arena. At the end of the call, Party A indicated they would contact Mr. Aurentz in the coming days.\nOn October 30, 2021, at the request of the Board of Directors, Guggenheim Securities provided information about its\nrelationships with Pfizer over the last five years. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities had verbally summarized\nthis information for Arena senior management before the meeting of the Board of Directors the prior day. The\ninformation provided by Guggenheim Securities indicated that during the five year period prior to October 30, 2021,\nGuggenheim Securities had been engaged by Pfizer with respect to various matters unrelated to the Merger in\n23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrespect of which Guggenheim Securities received compensation, including five separate completed transactions on\nwhich Guggenheim Securities acted on behalf of Pfizer during this period. The information further indicated\nGuggenheim Securities received compensation of approximately $110 million to $115 million in the aggregate from\nPfizer during this five year period. The Board of Directors had discussed the verbal summary of this information at its\nOctober 29 meeting and decided to further review at a subsequent meeting what role, if any, would be appropriate for\nGuggenheim Securities in connection with the proposed transaction. The Board of Directors then instructed Arena\nsenior management to consider an additional financial advisor for consideration by the Board of Directors.\nOn October 31, 2021, Arena and Pfizer entered into an amendment to an existing non-disclosure agreement between\nArena and Pfizer that was previously entered into in connection with a potential licensing transaction that was\nsubsequently abandoned. The amendment included a standstill provision for a 12 month period and a non-solicit\nprovision for a six month period. The standstill provision included customary exclusions, including to permit Pfizer to\napproach Arena privately and a fall away provision upon the entry into or public announcement of certain\nacquisition transactions.\nOn November 1, 2021, Arena held a management presentation for Pfizer during which Arena presented limited\ndiligence information related to the safety, efficacy and competitive landscape of etrasimod, including blinded data\navailable with respect to the ongoing ELEVATE UC-12 and ELEVATE UC-52 trials and completed trials relating to\nulcerative colitis, or \u201cUC,\u201d and atopic dermatitis, or \u201cAD\u201d.\nThe same day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of Cooley to\ndiscuss the engagement of one or more financial advisors. Arena senior management invited Evercore to the meeting\nto receive advice from an additional financial advisor regarding Pfizer\u2019s proposal and a potential strategic transaction\nand to evaluate their experience and capabilities relevant to a potential strategic transaction. After discussions, the\nBoard of Directors directed Arena senior management in an executive session at which Evercore was not present to\nbegin negotiating engagement letters with each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities for consideration by the\nBoard at a subsequent meeting.\nOn November 2, 2021, Ms. Deborah Baron, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Business Development and Mr. Shay\nTamari, Business Development Group Lead, Inflammation & Immunology from Pfizer contacted Mr. Aurentz following\nthe initial management presentation held on November 1, 2021 to provide feedback and request certain additional due\ndiligence information. In response to such request, Mr. Aurentz indicated that additional due diligence information\nwould be made available only upon receipt of a revised indication of interest from Pfizer reflecting an increased price\nper share from the price proposed in the October 27 Proposal.\nOn November 3, 2021, a representative from Party A contacted Mr. Aurentz to inform Arena that Party A would not be\nable to pursue a transaction with Arena at that time due to its focus on other strategic priorities.\nLater that day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of Cooley,\nEvercore and Guggenheim Securities. Representatives of Evercore summarized for the Board of Directors their\nrecommendations regarding a strategic process designed to maximize value for Arena stockholders and presented\ntheir preliminary views on value. The Board of Directors then reviewed Arena\u2019s Long Range Plan, which included the\nProjections. For a detailed discussion of the Projections, please see below under the caption \u201cThe Merger-Financial\nProjections\u201d. In connection with reviewing the Long Range Plan, the Board of Directors engaged in further\ndiscussion regarding the uncertainties inherent in Arena\u2019s standalone business plan, including the potential\noutcomes of clinical trials and the resulting ability to access adequate capital depending on those outcomes, and\nuncertainties in remaining a standalone business. The Board of Directors then directed Evercore and Guggenheim\nSecurities to use the Projections in materials presented to the Board of Directors, including as part of any valuation\nanalysis. Mr. Aurentz informed the Board of Directors that (i) Party A had declined to consider a potential transaction\nwith Arena and (ii) Pfizer had requested to have access to additional diligence information and that in response to\nsuch request, he indicated that additional information would only be made available upon an increase in price per\nshare from the price proposed in the October 27 Proposal. The Board of Directors further discussed the potential\nbenefits and risks associated with contacting additional third parties regarding their potential interest in a transaction\nwith Arena, including by reviewing a summary prepared by Arena senior management and Evercore and Guggenheim\nSecurities of additional third parties and considerations relevant to their potential interest in a transaction with Arena.\nOn November 4, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Representatives of each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities\nprovided a process update and presented their perspectives on the current biopharmaceutical market environment as\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwell as their preliminary financial analyses. During the subsequent executive session of the meeting at which\nEvercore and Guggenheim Securities were not present, the Board of Directors continued to discuss the potential\nstrategic transaction, including the potential benefits and risks associated with contacting additional third parties\nregarding potential interest in a transaction with Arena, as well as alternatives to the potential transaction, including\nArena continuing as a standalone company. The Board of Directors directed Arena senior management to work with\nEvercore and Guggenheim Securities to target those parties believed most likely to be interested in and able to\nacquire Arena. In addition, the Board of Directors determined to formally engage each of Evercore and Guggenheim\nSecurities in connection with the proposed transaction. In making this determination, the Board of Directors\nconsidered, among other things, Guggenheim Securities\u2019 longstanding relationship and familiarity with Arena\u2019s\nbusiness and its knowledge of industry participants as well as Guggenheim Securities\u2019 position as an internationally\nrecognized investment banking, financial advisory and securities firm. The Board of Directors also considered that\nEvercore is an internationally recognized investment banking, financial advisory and securities firm with expertise in\nthe biopharmaceutical sector that is regularly engaged in the valuation and financial assessment of businesses and\nsecurities in connection with mergers and acquisitions. Additionally, the Board of Directors considered the\ndisclosure previously provided by Guggenheim Securities regarding its relationships with Pfizer in the past five years\nand similar information provided by Evercore, which indicated that Evercore had not been engaged by Pfizer in the\npast five years. The Board of Directors discussed the terms of the engagement letters with each of Evercore and\nGuggenheim Securities, including the related fees, and approved the terms of the engagements with each of Evercore\nand Guggenheim Securities.\nLater that day, Arena executed an engagement letter with each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities formalizing the\nengagement of each to act as a financial advisor to the Board of Directors in connection with a potential strategic\ntransaction.\nOn November 8, 2021, Dr. Bourla indicated to Mr. Munshi that Pfizer would make a revised proposal. Later that day,\nPfizer sent Arena a revised indication of interest for $105.00 per share in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cNovember 8\nProposal\u201d). The November 8 Proposal indicated that it was subject to due diligence, which Pfizer would require\napproximately three weeks to complete following receipt of full diligence access.\nOn November 9, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities to discuss the November 8 Proposal. The Board of Directors engaged in\ndiscussion regarding the terms of the November 8 Proposal and determined that although the Board of Directors\nwould seek to negotiate additional value for Arena stockholders prior to further considering Pfizer\u2019s proposal, the\nNovember 8 Proposal was a basis on which the Board of Directors was willing to allow Pfizer to conduct additional\ndue diligence to enable it to potentially make an improved proposal. The Board of Directors also further discussed\nthe potential benefits and risks of contacting additional third parties regarding potential interest in a transaction with\nArena. The Board of Directors directed Arena senior management and representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim\nSecurities to pursue additional outreach to Party C and Party D, each a pharmaceutical company.\nFollowing the Board of Directors meeting on November 9, 2021, Mr. Munshi indicated to Dr. Bourla that Pfizer would\nneed to improve the terms of its November 8 Proposal and suggested that in addition to a higher upfront purchase\nprice, a transaction involving contingent value rights, or \u201cCVRs,\u201d could deliver additional value to Arena\nstockholders. Dr. Bourla indicated that Pfizer was not inclined to use CVRs but that it could potentially proposal a\nhigher price per share depending upon the results of its due diligence. Consistent with the Board of Directors\u2019\ndetermination earlier that day, Mr. Munshi agreed to move forward with providing additional diligence information.\nMr. Munshi and Dr. Bourla agreed to speak again during the week of November 14, 2021 to further discuss price.\nOn November 9, 2021, representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities contacted a representative of Party C\nregarding interest in a potential transaction with Arena. Party C indicated they would contact Evercore and\nGuggenheim Securities shortly.\nOn November 10, 2021, representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities spoke with a representative of Party\nD regarding interest in a potential transaction with Arena. The next day, a representative of Party D contacted\nEvercore and Guggenheim Securities to indicate that Party D was not interested in a potential transaction with Arena\nat that time.\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on November 10, 2021, Pfizer sent Arena an initial due diligence request list, and Arena opened a virtual data\nroom to Pfizer, which included, among other things, certain information regarding Arena\u2019s intellectual property,\ncertain tax information items and data and certain other information regarding both historical and ongoing clinical\ntrials.\nOn November 11, 2021, Party C contacted representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities and noted that they\nwere interested in exploring a potential transaction and requested a non-disclosure agreement.\nOn November 11, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Representatives of each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities\ninformed the Board of Directors that (i) Party D stated that it was not interested in considering a transaction at that\ntime and (ii) Party C indicated that it was interested in exploring a potential transaction and requested a non-\ndisclosure agreement. Representatives from Evercore and Guggenheim Securities summarized Party C\u2019s diligence\nrequests and a request for a management presentation. Arena senior management indicated that it was willing to\nshare blinded data with a small number of individuals from Party C, in addition to high priority diligence items, so that\nParty C would be in a position to submit a preliminary indication of interest. Representatives of each of Evercore and\nGuggenheim Securities also informed the Board of Directors that access to the virtual data room had been granted to\nPfizer the previous day.\nOn November 12, 2021, Arena and Party C executed a non-disclosure agreement, which included a standstill\nprovision for a 12 month period and a non-solicit provision for a 12 month period. The standstill provision included\ncustomary exclusions such as permitting Party C to approach Arena privately and confidentially and a fall away\nprovision upon the entry into or public announcement of certain acquisition transactions.\nLater that day, certain members of the Arena legal team, along with Cooley and Arena\u2019s outside intellectual property\ncounsel, held a legal diligence call and an intellectual property diligence call with representatives of Pfizer and Ropes\n& Gray LLP (\u201cRopes & Gray\u201d), Pfizer\u2019s outside legal counsel.\nOn November 13, 2021, representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities had a call with Party C where Party C\nrequested additional diligence information.\nOn November 15, 2021, Mr. Munshi and Dr. Bourla spoke regarding Pfizer\u2019s the November 8 Proposal and deal\nprocess and timing considerations. Dr. Bourla indicated that Pfizer\u2019s due diligence process was ongoing. Also on\nNovember 15, 2021, Party C conducted a diligence call with Arena management with respect to the blinded data and\nArena\u2019s clinical development plans.\nOn November 16, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Mr. Munshi provided an update on the strategic process and\ndiscussed his November 15, 2021 conversation with Dr. Bourla. Arena senior management then provided an update\nregarding Pfizer\u2019s diligence to date. Representatives of each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities summarized the\nstatus of outreach to other third parties regarding a potential transaction, including the status of discussions with\nParty C. The Board of Directors discussed the potential benefits and risks of pursuing additional outreach to other\npotential buyers, in the pharmaceutical industry. Based on that discussion and the discussion at prior meetings, as\nwell as the fact that multiple third parties had been contacted to date, the Board of Directors determined not to\ncontact additional third parties at that time.\nThe same day, Mr. Munshi emailed Dr. Bourla stating that although Arena and Pfizer were apart on value, Arena\nwould move forward in negotiations and requested an initial draft of the Merger Agreement.\nOn November 17, 2021, Ropes & Gray sent an initial draft merger agreement to Cooley. The draft Merger Agreement\nproposed, among other things, a one-step merger structure, obligations by Pfizer to use commercially reasonable\nefforts to obtain required regulatory approvals, an unspecified termination fee payable by Arena to Pfizer in certain\ncircumstances, no reverse termination fee payable by Pfizer to Arena, multiple closing conditions relating to receipt of\nregulatory approvals and no carveouts to the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect relating to the results of\nclinical trials. The same day, Arena and Pfizer senior management had a diligence call to discuss trial design and\nclinical questions relating to the AD trial.\nOn November 17, 2021, a representative of Party C contacted representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities\nto convey that it would not be submitting an indication of interest at that time.\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 18, 2021, Mr. Munshi and Dr. Bourla spoke regarding the draft merger agreement. Mr. Munshi\nsummarized for Dr. Bourla certain provisions that were not acceptable to Arena. Dr. Bourla requested that Mr. Munshi\ndirect Cooley to share a draft merger agreement that would address the concerns raised by Mr. Munshi.\nOn November 18, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities to review the transaction process with Pfizer and the status of outreach\nto third parties. Representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities confirmed that Party C had indicated that it\nwould not be submitting an indication of interest at that time. Representatives of Cooley summarized key terms of the\ndraft merger agreement provided by Ropes & Gray on November 17, 2021. Mr. Munshi updated the Board of\nDirectors that he and Dr. Bourla had agreed that Cooley would prepare a revised agreement on behalf of Arena with\nterms acceptable to the Board of Directors. Representatives of Cooley discussed with the Board of Directors\nconsiderations regarding certain terms of the merger agreement, including those regarding a tender offer or merger\nstructure, regulatory efforts obligations, closing conditions, and termination fees. The Board of Directors gave\ndirection based on this discussion regarding terms to be included in the draft merger agreement being prepared by\nCooley.\nOn November 19, 2021, Arena issued a press release disclosing that it had achieved its target enrollment in Study A\nof the Phase 2/3 CULTIVATE trial for etrasimod.\nLater that day, Cooley sent Ropes & Gray a draft merger agreement, which proposed, among other things, a two-step\ntender offer transaction structure, an Arena termination fee of 2.25% of the transaction value, regulatory efforts\nobligations requiring Pfizer to take all actions necessary or advisable to obtain any required regulatory approvals and\nbroader carveouts to the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect, including for adverse events or outcomes of\nkey clinical trials.\nOn November 20, 2021, Dr. Bourla indicated to Mr. Munshi that based on its due diligence to date, Pfizer no longer\nexpected to be able to offer the price indicated in the November 8 Proposal. Dr. Bourla asked Mr. Munshi whether\nthere might be any alternative transaction structures (such as a license of Arena\u2019s assets outside the United States)\nor alternative price structures acceptable to Arena.\nOn November 21, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Mr. Munshi summarized for the Board of Directors his conversation\nwith Dr. Bourla the previous day. The Board of Directors discussed whether to consider alternative transaction\nstructures or alternative price structures that could provide additional value to Arena stockholders. Based on this\ndiscussion, it was the consensus of the Board of Directors that Arena should continue to engage in discussions with\nPfizer and that other than a transaction that included CVRs tied to future achievement of certain milestones by the\nArena business, an alternative structure would not be in the best interests of Arena and its stockholders. The Board\nof Directors agreed to take a brief recess from the meeting and directed Mr. Munshi to contact Dr. Bourla to indicate\nthat the Board of Directors would consider a proposal involving CVRs.\nDuring that recess, Mr. Munshi contacted Dr. Bourla to indicate that the Board of Directors would consider a\nproposal involving CVRs and that other transaction structures were not of interest to the Board of Directors at that\ntime. Following that conversation, the meeting of the Board of Directors reconvened and Mr. Munshi summarized his\nconversation with Dr. Bourla.\nOn November 24, 2021, the Omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was first reported to the World\nHealth Organization, which designated it as a \u201cVariant of Concern\u201d on November 26, 2021.\nThat same day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of Cooley,\nEvercore and Guggenheim Securities to discuss the transaction process.\nOn November 26, 2021, Mr. Munshi and Dr. Bourla spoke twice. During these conversations, Dr. Bourla informed Mr.\nMunshi that Pfizer did not expect to be able to offer the amount proposed in the November 8 Proposal based on the\nresults of its due diligence review, which remained ongoing. Dr. Bourla indicated that Pfizer was willing to continue to\nevaluate a transaction at a price of $95.00 per share plus a per share CVR or at a price of $100.00 per share without\nCVRs.\nOn November 27, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Mr. Munshi updated the Board of Directors on his conversations with\nDr. Bourla the previous day. The Board of Directors discussed whether to continue discussions\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwith Pfizer, taking into account, among other things, Mr. Munshi\u2019s most recent conversations with Dr. Bourla, the\ninherent uncertainties in remaining a standalone company, including the potential outcomes of clinical trials, the\nresulting ability to access capital depending on those outcomes, the recent lack of interest expressed by Party C and\nParty D, and the potential for lack of interest among other potential acquirors depending on the outcomes of pending\nclinical trials. The Board of Directors also received information from Arena senior management regarding the Omicron\nvariant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 that had been reported to the World Health Organization and\ndiscussed the potential risks Arena may face in light of the new variant, including potential impacts on its ability to\nconduct clinical trials on the timelines then contemplated. Following this discussion, the Board of Directors directed\nMr. Munshi to contact Dr. Bourla to indicate that Arena would continue to negotiate the terms of the Merger\nAgreement and allow Pfizer to progress its due diligence without expressing a view on price at that time. The Board of\nDirectors further directed the Arena senior management team and Arena\u2019s legal and financial advisors to engage in\ndiscussions with Pfizer and its legal and financial advisors to determine whether there would be terms on which Pfizer\nwould be willing to transact with Arena that would be acceptable to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors\nindicated that certainty of closing, including appropriate carveouts to the definition of Company Material Adverse\nEffect relating to clinical trials, appropriate regulatory efforts obligations, an appropriate reverse termination fee and\ntermination fee, an outside date not substantially longer than one year and the ability to adequately operate Arena\u2019s\nbusiness between signing and closing of a transaction would be essential factors in the Board\u2019s consideration of any\ntransaction.\nOn November 28, 2021, Mr. Aurentz spoke with Mr. Shay Tamari, Business Development Group Lead, Inflammation &\nImmunology at Pfizer. Messrs. Aurentz and Tamari agreed to connect representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim\nSecurities with representatives of BofA Securities, Inc. (\u201cBofA Securities\u201d) and Centerview Partners LLC\n(\u201cCenterview\u201d), financial advisors to Pfizer, to facilitate further discussion of certain key transaction terms, including\nthe outside date, termination fee, reverse termination fee, regulatory efforts covenants and closing conditions relating\nto regulatory approvals. Mr. Aurentz and Mr. Tamari also agreed to progress in parallel the negotiation of other terms\nof the Merger Agreement and completion of Pfizer\u2019s due diligence.\nLater that day, Ropes & Gray sent Cooley a draft Merger Agreement, which was substantially similar to the draft\nRopes & Gray shared on November 17, 2021, except that the draft included a reverse termination fee equal to the then\nunspecified termination fee payable by Pfizer to Arena. The draft Merger Agreement also included carveouts to the\ndefinition of Company Material Adverse Effect for adverse events or outcomes relating to the ELEVATE UC-12 and\nELEVATE UC-52 trials.\nOn November 30, 2021, representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities held a meeting with BofA Securities\nand Centerview to convey the proposal on certain key terms of the Merger Agreement developed by Arena senior\nmanagement and its legal and financial advisors based on the guidance provided by the Board at the November 27\nmeeting. Representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities proposed (i) an initial outside date of March 15,\n2022 that could be extended to December 15, 2022 by either party, (ii) that on March 15, 2022, either party could\nterminate the Merger Agreement and Arena would receive a $350 million reverse termination fee from Pfizer in certain\ncircumstances relating to the failure of certain regulatory approvals to be obtained, (iii) that if either party extended\nthe proposed outside date, then Pfizer would advance $750 million to Arena as a loan at the time of the extension and\nif the Merger Agreement was subsequently terminated in certain circumstances relating to the failure of certain\nregulatory approvals to be obtained, then the $750 million loan was to be forgiven and (iv) stronger regulatory efforts\ncovenants and closing conditions relating to regulatory approvals.\nLater that day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of Cooley,\nEvercore and Guggenheim Securities. Mr. Munshi provided an update on the transaction process. Representatives of\nthe legal and financial advisors summarized the terms proposed during the discussion between both parties\u2019 financial\nadvisors earlier that day, including considerations relating to the proposed outside date, reverse termination fee, loan\nand regulatory efforts covenants.\nDuring the period from November 30, 2021 through December 2, 2021, representatives of Arena senior management\nand Pfizer management and their respective legal and financial advisors continued to engage in discussions\nregarding the terms of the Merger Agreement, the amounts of the termination fee and reverse termination fee and the\ncircumstances in which they would be payable, Pfizer\u2019s regulatory efforts obligations and regulatory closing\nconditions, Arena\u2019s ability to pursue financing between signing and closing and the exceptions to the definition of\nCompany Material Adverse Effect.\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 2, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Representatives from each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities\ngave an update on the transaction process, including a summary of their discussions over the prior few days with\nBofA Securities and Centerview. Representatives of Cooley summarized their discussions over the same period with\nRopes & Gray. Representatives from each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities then presented an updated\nfinancial analysis of the potential transaction with Pfizer. Following the presentations from each of Evercore and\nGuggenheim Securities, the Board of Directors met in an executive session and discussed views regarding price and\nother transaction terms. At the conclusion of the meeting, based on the further discussion by the Board of Directors\nof certain factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors, including the inherent uncertainties in remaining a\nstandalone company, the potential outcomes of clinical trials, the resulting ability to access capital depending on\nthose outcomes and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and the potential risks Arena may\nface in light of the new variant, the Board of Directors directed Mr. Munshi to continue to negotiate with Pfizer, with\nthe assistance of Arena\u2019s legal and financial advisors.\nLater that day, Cooley sent Ropes & Gray a revised draft Merger Agreement and an initial draft of the disclosure\nschedules. From December 2, 2021 to immediately prior to signing the Merger Agreement on December 12, 2021, the\nparties and their respective legal and financial advisors continued to negotiate the terms of the Merger Agreement,\nincluding, among other things, the amounts of the termination fee and reverse termination fee and the circumstances\nin which they would be payable, Pfizer\u2019s regulatory efforts obligations and regulatory closing conditions, Arena\u2019s\nability to obtain financing between signing and closing and the exceptions to the definition of Company Material\nAdverse Effect, in all cases based on the views of the Board of Directors discussed with Arena senior management\nand Arena\u2019s legal and financial advisors. During this period, Cooley and Ropes & Gray also exchanged multiple\nrevised drafts of the Merger Agreement.\nOn December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Arena senior management gave an update on the transaction process\nand an update regarding the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, including a summary of the terms of the draft\nMerger Agreement and material open items based on negotiations to date.

In addition, Mr. Aurentz\nprovided a written summary of Arena\u2019s proposal with respect to key terms to Ms. Baron. As part of this proposal, Mr.\nAurentz indicated that Pfizer should propose an increase to $105.00 per share, the price included in the November 8\nProposal for consideration by the Board of Directors.\nOn December 10, 2021, Ms. Baron contacted Mr. Aurentz to convey Pfizer\u2019s position regarding certain key terms of\nthe Merger Agreement, including Pfizer's proposal of $100.00 per share. Later that day, Ms. Baron contacted Mr.\nAurentz again to confirm to Arena that $100.00 per share was Pfizer\u2019s best and final proposal (which we refer to as the\n\u201cDecember 10 Proposal\u201d).\nOn December 11, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Messrs. Munshi and Aurentz summarized the discussions with Pfizer\nover the past two days, including the December 10 Proposal, which represented Pfizer\u2019s best and final proposal.\nRepresentatives from Cooley summarized the fiduciary duties applicable to the Board of Directors in the context of\nthe proposed transaction. Representatives from Cooley then summarized the latest draft of the Merger Agreement,\nwhich had been sent to Cooley by Ropes & Gray earlier that day to reflect the conversations the prior day between\nMr. Aurentz and Ms. Baron, including the provisions relating to the reverse termination fee, Pfizer\u2019s regulatory efforts\nobligations, exceptions to the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect relating to\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nclinical trials and the termination fee. Representatives from each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities presented\ntheir financial analysis of the potential transaction with Pfizer. Following this discussion, the Board of Directors\ndirected Arena senior management and the legal and financial advisors to finalize the terms of the Merger Agreement\nfor consideration by the Board of Directors.\nThroughout the remainder of December 11 and December 12, 2021, Cooley and Ropes & Gray worked to finalize the\nMerger Agreement and related documents.\nOn December 12, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of\nCooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. At this meeting, Evercore reviewed with the Board of Directors its\nfinancial analysis of the Merger Consideration and delivered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion (which was\nsubsequently confirmed in writing) to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions,\nlimitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore\u2019s opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received\nby the holders of shares of common stock of Arena in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nholders. Also at this meeting of the Board of Directors, Guggenheim Securities reviewed its financial analysis of the\nMerger Consideration and rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing), to the Board of\nDirectors to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications\nand conditions described in Guggenheim Securities\u2019 opinion, the Merger Consideration in connection with the\nMerger was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of common stock of Arena.

For more information concerning\nthe terms of the Merger Agreement, see the section titled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement.\u201d\nRepresentatives of Cooley answered questions from members of the Board of Directors regarding the terms of the\nMerger Agreement and the potential risks associated with the completion of the Merger based on the terms of the\nMerger Agreement. After the presentation by Cooley, the Board of Directors continued to discuss the potential\ntransaction with Pfizer, Arena\u2019s various alternatives (including whether to continue to operate the business on a\nstandalone basis) and the reasons that the Board of Directors determined that the proposed Merger with Pfizer,\nMerger Agreement and other transactions contemplated thereby were advisable and in the best interests of Arena\nand its stockholders. For more information concerning the factors that the Board of Directors considered, see the\nsection titled \u201cThe Merger-Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger.\u201d Following that\ndiscussion, the Board of Directors unanimously determined that the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other\ntransactions contemplated thereby were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Arena and its stockholders, and\nauthorized and directed Arena senior management to execute the final Merger Agreement and related definitive\ndocuments with Pfizer.\nLater that day, Arena and Pfizer executed the Merger Agreement.\nOn December 13, 2021, prior to the opening of trading on the U.S. stock markets, Arena and Pfizer issued a joint press\nrelease announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.",

The Board of Directors\nconsidered the following reasons (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which it viewed as\ngenerally supporting its (i) determination that the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable,\nfair to and in the best interests of Arena and its stockholders\u037e (ii) approval of and declaration that it is advisable to\nenter into the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) direction that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of\nArena\u2019s stockholders at the Special Meeting\u037e and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,\nresolution to recommend that Arena\u2019s stockholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approve the\nMerger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein:\n\u2022\nCompelling Premium: the fact that the Merger Consideration of $100.00 per share represented a compelling\npremium to historical market prices for the shares of Arena common stock, including that the Merger\nConsideration constituted a premium of:\n\u25cb\napproximately 100% to the closing price of common stock of $49.94 per share on December 10, 2021,\nthe last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger\u037e\n\u25cb\napproximately 76% to the 30-day trading period volume weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of

and\n\u25cb\napproximately 66% to the 180-day trading period VWAP of common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nAttractive Certainty of Value: in the judgment of the Board of Directors, the all-cash consideration of\n$100.00 per share of common stock, taking into account the business, operations, prospects, strategic and\nshort and long term operating plans, assets, liabilities and financial condition of Arena, and the relative\ncertainty and liquidity of the all-cash consideration, is more favorable to Arena\u2019s stockholders than the\nrisk-adjusted value expected from the alternative of Arena continuing to operate independently and\npursuing its current business and financial plans on a standalone basis, taking into account near-term and\nlonger term uncertainties associated with continued independence\u037e\n\u2022\nFavorable Valuation: the fact that the Merger Consideration of $100.00 per share represented a highly\nfavorable valuation for Arena when compared to the projected valuation range associated with continuing\nas a standalone company\u037e\n\u2022\nCertainty of Value: the fact that an all-cash transaction would offer certainty of value to Arena\nstockholders, as compared to the risks and uncertainties of continuing as a standalone company as\ndescribed below\u037e\n\u2022\nActive Negotiating Process: the belief that (i) as a result of an active negotiating process over the course\nof several weeks that resulted in an increase to the Merger Consideration from Pfizer\u2019s initial offer (for more\ninformation, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Background of the\nMerger\u201d), Arena had obtained Pfizer\u2019s best offer, (ii) there was substantial risk of losing Pfizer\u2019s final offer\nof $100.00 per share if Arena continued to pursue a higher price and (iii) based on the conversations and\nnegotiations with Pfizer and the strategic process described below, as of the date of the Merger Agreement,\nthe offer of $100.00 per share represented the highest price reasonably obtainable by Arena under the\ncircumstances\u037e\n\u2022\nNo Alternative Proposals: the strategic transaction process conducted by Arena (for more information,\nplease see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Background of the Merger\u201d),\nincluding the fact that multiple strategic acquirors were contacted or solicited in an effort to obtain the best\nvalue reasonably available to Arena stockholders, and that no such party was willing to move forward with\nArena regarding a potential transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nHigh Degree of Certainty of Closing: the high degree of certainty that the closing would be achieved in a\ntimely manner, under the terms of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u25cb\nthe financial strength of Pfizer and its ability to fund the Merger Consideration with cash on hand\u037e\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u25cb\nthe absence of any financing

the Arena Termination Fee is reasonable, is\nconsistent with the amount of such fees payable in comparable transactions on a relative basis, and is\nnot preclusive of, or a substantial impediment to, a third party making an Acquisition Proposal (for\nmore information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement-The Board of

to complete the Merger.\nThe Board of Directors assessed Arena\u2019s prospects for substantially increasing stockholder value as a standalone\ncompany in excess of the Merger Consideration, given the risks and uncertainties in Arena\u2019s business, including:\n\u2022\nthe fact that Arena\u2019s lead product development candidate, etrasimod, has not yet been approved for\nmarketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by any similar non-U.S. regulatory body, as well as\nthe status and prospects for Arena\u2019s current pipeline of other drug candidates, and the risks inherent in

upon whom Arena relies\u037e\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe current state of the U.S. and global economies, including the recent downward trend in the\nbiopharmaceutical financial markets, increased volatility resulting from escalating political and global trade\ntensions, and the current and potential impact in both the near term and long term on the biopharmaceutical\nindustry and the future commercialization efforts required if any of Arena\u2019s product candidates are\napproved for sale, including the numerous risks, costs and uncertainties associated with research,\ndevelopment and commercialization of Arena\u2019s pipeline programs, all of which risks are enhanced by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and may remain present following the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic\u037e\n\u2022\nthe availability of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to Arena\u2019s stockholders who do not vote\nin favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required procedures under\nDelaware law, which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to have a Delaware court\ndetermine the fair value of their shares, which may be determined by the court to be more than, less than, or\nthe same as the amount such stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe likelihood of satisfying the conditions to complete the Merger and the likelihood that the Merger will be\ncompleted.\nThe Board of Directors also took into consideration that as a standalone company Arena would need to seek\nadditional funding through future equity, royalty and/or debt financings or additional collaborations or strategic\npartnerships, and any such fundraising could have a highly dilutive effect on Arena\u2019s existing stockholders, could\nrequire Arena to enter into restrictive covenants, might only be available on unfavorable terms given the recent\ndownward trend in the biopharmaceutical financial markets, or might not be available at all.\nThe Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the\nfollowing (which are not listed in any relative order of importance):\n\u2022\nthe fact that Arena would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and stockholders\nwould no longer participate in any future earnings or growth and would not benefit from any potential\nfuture appreciation in value of Arena\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and costs to Arena if the Merger does not close or is not completed in a timely manner, including\nthe diversion of management and employee attention, and the potential effect on its ongoing clinical trials\nand preparation for potential regulatory approval and commercialization\u037e\n\u2022\nthe requirement that Arena pay Pfizer the Arena Termination Fee under certain circumstances following\ntermination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Board of Directors terminates the Merger Agreement\nin order to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (for more information, please see the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-The Board of\nDirectors\u2019 Recommendation\u037e Arena Adverse Recommendation Change\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of Arena\u2019s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including the\nrequirement that Arena conduct in all material respects its business in the ordinary course of business\nconsistent with past practice, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent Arena from\nundertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the\nMerger Agreement, Arena might have pursued\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that an all-cash transaction would generally be taxable to Arena\u2019s stockholders that are U.S.\npersons for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit Arena and its representatives from soliciting third\nparty acquisition proposals until the earlier of the filing of the certificate of merger or the termination of the\nMerger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the\nMerger (many of which are payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time\nand effort of Arena management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt its business\noperations and have a negative effect on its financial results\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of\ntermination of the Merger Agreement on the trading price of Arena\u2019s common stock\u037e\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe fact that the completion of the Merger will require certain antitrust clearance and consents, which\nclearances and consents could subject the Merger to unforeseen delays and risks\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Arena\u2019s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or\nin addition to, those of Arena\u2019s stockholders (For more information, please see the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201c-Interests of Arena\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of key management or other personnel of Arena during the pendency of the Merger.\nThe foregoing discussion of reasons for the recommendation to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the\nMerger and the transactions contemplated thereby addresses the reasons considered by the Board of Directors in\nconsideration of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of reasons considered by the Board of Directors in\nconnection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board of Directors did not find\nit practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons considered in\nreaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in considering the information and reasons described above,\nindividual members of the Board of Directors each applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process\nand may have given differing weights to differing factors. The Board of Directors based its unanimous\nrecommendation on the totality of the information presented. The explanation of the reasons and reasoning set forth\nabove contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nFinancial Projections\nThe Projections included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Arena senior\nmanagement. KPMG LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with\nrespect to the accompanying Projections and, accordingly, KPMG LLP does not express an opinion or any other form\nof assurance with respect thereto. The KPMG LLP report incorporated by reference relates to Arena\u2019s previously\nissued historical financial statements. It does not extend to the Projections and should not be read to do so.\nThe Projections reflect estimates and assumptions made by Arena senior management with respect to general\nbusiness, economic, competitive, regulatory and other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of\nwhich are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Arena\u2019s control. In particular, the Projections, while\npresented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are\ninherently uncertain. Because the Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater\nuncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each and every circumstance that could have an\neffect on Arena\u2019s business and its results of operations. The Projections were developed solely using the information\navailable to Arena senior management at the time they were created and reflects assumptions as to certain business\ndecisions that are subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual results or that may result in the\nProjections not being achieved include, but are not limited to, the ability to generate revenue for each of etrasimod\nindications, ralinepag and other Arena pipeline assets, the effect of regulatory actions, the decisions of third-party\npartners, the ability to out-license products, success of clinical testing, the effect of global economic conditions,\nincluding COVID-19, and increases in regulatory oversight and other risk factors described in Arena\u2019s annual report\non Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current\nreports on Form 8-K. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to\nchange. Modeling and forecasting the future in the biopharmaceutical industry, in particular, is a highly speculative\nendeavor.\nNone of Arena, Pfizer or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any representation\nto any stockholder regarding the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the Projections or the\nultimate performance of Arena relative to the Projections. The inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement\ndoes not constitute an admission or representation of Arena that the Projections or the information contained therein\nis material. Except as required by applicable law, neither Arena nor any of its affiliates intends to, and each of them\ndisclaims any obligation to, update, correct or otherwise revise the Projections if any or all of them have changed or\nchange or otherwise have become, are or become inappropriate (even in the short term). These considerations should\nbe taken into account if evaluating the Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.\nThe Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other\ninformation regarding Arena in its public filings with the SEC. The Projections were developed by Arena senior\nmanagement on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMerger Agreement, and therefore the Projections do not give effect to the proposed Merger or any changes to\nArena\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Merger, including any costs\nincurred in connection with the proposed Merger. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account the effect of\nany failure of the proposed Merger to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that\ncontext.\nThe Projections further reflect subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple\ninterpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The inclusion of the\nProjections should not be regarded as an indication that Arena or anyone who received the Projections then\nconsidered, or now considers, the Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this\ninformation should not be relied upon as such. Arena senior management views the Projections as being subject to\ninherent risks and uncertainties associated with such long-range projections.\nEBIT and unlevered free cash flow contained in the Projections set forth below are each \u201cnon-GAAP financial\nmeasures,\u201d which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-\nGAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be different\nfrom non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

In calculating unlevered free cash flow, Evercore did not offset\nArena\u2019s taxes by net operating losses, resulting in a decrease to unlevered free cash flow of $90 million in 2027, $153 million in\n2028, $246 million in 2029, $373 million in 2030 and $257 million in 2031. Evercore separately calculated the present value of\nthe tax savings from Arena\u2019s estimated usage of net operating losses and included the result in its determination of estimated\nimplied equity values as discussed in the section entitled.

As part of this engagement,\nArena requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be\nreceived by the holders of common stock. At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on December 12, 2021,\nEvercore rendered to the Board of Directors its opinion to the effect that, as of December 12, 2021 and based upon\nand subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore\u2019s opinion, the\nMerger Consideration to be received by the holders of common stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated as of December 12, 2021, which sets forth, among other\nthings, the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the\nscope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is\nincorporated herein by reference. Arena encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety.\nEvercore\u2019s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Board of Directors (in its\ncapacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not constitute a\nrecommendation to the Board of Directors or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any\nholder of common stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore\u2019s opinion does not address the relative\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmerits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to Arena, nor\ndoes it address the underlying business decision of Arena to engage in the Merger. \nIn connection with rendering its opinion Evercore, among other things:\n(i)\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Arena that Evercore\ndeemed to be relevant\u037e\n(ii)\nreviewed the Projections relating to Arena prepared and furnished to Evercore by management of Arena, as\napproved for Evercore\u2019s use by Arena\u037e\n(iii) discussed with management of Arena their assessment of the past and current operations of Arena, the\ncurrent financial condition and prospects of Arena, and the Projections\u037e\n(iv) reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the common stock\u037e\n(v)\ncompared the financial performance of Arena and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain\nother publicly traded companies that Evercore deemed relevant\u037e\n(vi) compared the financial performance of Arena and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with the\nfinancial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Evercore deemed relevant\u037e\n(vii) reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n(viii) performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore deemed\nappropriate.\nFor purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the\nfinancial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to,\ndiscussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent verification of such information (and has not\nassumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and further relied upon the\nassurances of the management of Arena that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such\ninformation inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Projections, Evercore assumed with Arena\u2019s consent that\nthey have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith\njudgments of management of Arena as to the future financial performance of Arena and the other matters covered\nthereby. Evercore expressed no view as to the Projections or the assumptions on which they are based.\nFor purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the\nrepresentations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party\nwill perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that\nall conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. Evercore\nfurther assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals\nor releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or\ncondition that would have an adverse effect on Arena or the consummation of the Merger or reduce the\ncontemplated benefits of the Merger to the holders of the common stock.\nEvercore did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Arena and did not make or assume\nany responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any\ncontingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Arena, nor was Evercore furnished with any\nsuch valuations or appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate the solvency or fair value of Arena under any state or\nfederal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore\u2019s opinion is necessarily based upon\ninformation made available to it as of December 12, 2021 and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they\nexisted and as could be evaluated as of that date. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect\nEvercore\u2019s opinion and that Evercore does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.\nEvercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to\nthe holders of the common stock, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration. Evercore did not\nexpress any view on, and its opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any\nconsideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of Arena, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to\nany of the officers, directors or employees of Arena, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Merger\nConsideration or otherwise.

Evercore is not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and has assumed the accuracy and\ncompleteness of assessments by Arena and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.\nSet forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with the Board of Directors on\nDecember 12, 2021 in connection with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does not purport to be\na complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses described and the results of\nthese analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Evercore. Except as\notherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on\nmarket data that existed on or before December 10, 2021 (the last trading date prior to the rendering of Evercore\u2019s\nopinion), and is not necessarily indicative of current or future market conditions.\nFor purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered industry performance, general business, economic,\nmarket and financial conditions, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of its\nopinion, many of which are beyond the control of Arena. The estimates contained in Evercore\u2019s analyses and\nreviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not necessarily indicative\nof actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those\nsuggested by Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies,\nbusinesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or\nsecurities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore\u2019s analyses\nand reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nThe following summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order\nto fully understand the analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables\nare not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses.\nConsidering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses,\nincluding the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete\nview of such analyses. \nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nEvercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Arena to calculate the estimated present value of the\nstandalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows, defined as net operating profit after tax, plus depreciation and\namortization, plus share-based compensation, less increases in net working capital and capital expenditures, that\nArena was forecasted to generate during Arena\u2019s fiscal years 2022 through 2040 based on the Projections provided\nby Arena senior management. Evercore calculated terminal values for Arena by applying perpetuity growth rates of\nnegative 60.0% to negative 80.0%, which range was selected based on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and\nexperience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Arena was forecasted to\ngenerate based on Projections. The cash flows were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2021 using\ndiscount rates ranging from 8.5% to 10.0%, which were based on an estimate of Arena\u2019s weighted average cost of\ncapital, and the mid-year cash flow discounting convention, which range was selected based on Evercore\u2019s\nprofessional judgment and experience. In calculating Arena\u2019s implied enterprise value, Evercore included the upfront\npayment made to Aristea on July 27, 2021. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, Arena\u2019s net debt\n(calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of December 10, 2021, certain minority interests, the cost\nof projected future capital raises, the present value of tax savings from Arena\u2019s estimated usage of net operating\nlosses based on the Projections and the number of fully diluted shares of common stock, in each case as provided by\nArena senior management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of common stock of\n$82.95 to $101.00, compared to the Merger Consideration.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nEvercore reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information related to the following selected transactions\ninvolving publicly-traded target companies in the biopharmaceutical industry announced since 2015 (the \u201cSelected\nTransactions\u201d). The Selected Transactions reviewed by Evercore, and the month and year each was announced, are\nset forth in the table below. For each Selected Transaction, Evercore calculated the implied enterprise value (defined\nas the target company\u2019s implied equity value based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total\ndebt, plus preferred equity and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of each target\u2019s T+5\nrevenue (meaning revenue during the fifth year after the transaction was announced, based on broker consensus\nestimates as of the applicable unaffected date of each respective transaction, (\u201cT+5 Revenue\u201d)) as of the\nannouncement of the applicable transaction.\nMonth and Year\nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nT+5 Revenue Multiple\nNovember 2021\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nDicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n8.5x\nMarch 2021\nAmgen Inc.\nFive Prime Therapeutics, Inc.\n4.2x\nAugust 2020\nSanofi S.A.\nPrincipia Biopharma\n6.7x\nJanuary 2020\nEli Lilly and Company\nDermira, Inc.\n2.1x\nNovember 2019\nNovartis AG\nThe Medicines Company\n5.6x\nOctober 2018\nNovartis AG\nEndocyte Inc.\n3.3x\nMay 2018\nEli Lilly and Company\nArmo Biosciences, Inc.\n4.3x\nJanuary 2018\nCelgene Corporation\nJuno Therapeutics, Inc.\n4.4x\nJuly 2015\nCelgene Corporation\nReceptos Inc.\n7.1x\nBased on the multiples it derived from the Selected Transactions and based on its professional judgment and\nexperience, Evercore selected a reference range of enterprise value to T+5 Revenue Multiples of 4.0x to 7.0x and\napplied this range of multiples to Arena\u2019s estimated 2026 revenue based on the Projections. Based on this range of\nimplied enterprise values and the number of fully diluted shares of common stock, in each case as provided by Arena\nsenior management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of common stock of $69.75 to\n$109.80, compared to the Merger Consideration.\nAlthough none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the Selected Transactions analysis is directly\ncomparable to Arena and none of the Selected Transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, Evercore selected\nthese transactions because they involve companies or businesses that Evercore, in its professional judgment and\nexperience, considered generally relevant to Arena for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating the Selected\nTransactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market\nconditions and other factors existing at the time of the Selected Transactions, and other matters, as well as\ndifferences in financial, business and operating characteristics and other factors relevant to the target companies or\nbusinesses in the Selected Transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely\nmathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could\naffect the relative values of the target companies or businesses in the Selected Transactions and the multiples\nderived from the Selected Transactions. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in\nitself a meaningful method of using the data of the Selected Transactions.\nOther Factors\nEvercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to\nits opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:\nLast 52-Week Trading Range\nEvercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of common stock during the twelve (12) month period ended\nDecember 10, 2021, noting that the low and high closing prices during such period ranged from $45.50 (on August 19,\n2021) to $85.00 (February 16, 2021) per share of common stock, respectively.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets\nEvercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of common stock prepared and\npublished by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of December 10, 2021, the last full trading day\nprior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the Board of Directors. These price targets reflect analysts\u2019\nestimates of the future public market trading price of the shares of common stock at the time the price target was\npublished. As of December 10, 2021, the range of selected equity research analyst price targets per share of common\nstock was $71.00 to $120.00. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not\nnecessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares of common stock and these target prices and the\nanalysts\u2019 earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors\naffecting the financial performance of Arena and future general industry and market conditions.\nSelected Public Company Trading Analysis\nEvercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of Arena to corresponding financial multiples and\nratios for the following selected publicly traded companies in the biopharmaceutical industry (the \u201cSelected\nCompanies\u201d):\n\u2022\nBiohaven Pharmaceuticals Holding Company Ltd.\n\u2022\nKodiak Sciences Inc.\n\u2022\nApellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\u2022\nAllakos Inc.\n\u2022\nChemocentryx, Inc.\n\u2022\nBioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\u2022\nGlobal Blood Therapeutics, Inc.\n\u2022\nReata Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\u2022\nKiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.\nFor each of the Selected Companies, Evercore calculated enterprise value (defined as equity market capitalization plus\ntotal debt, plus preferred equity and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of estimated\nrevenue multiples in 2024, 2025 and 2026, based on closing share prices as of December 10, 2021. Estimated financial\ndata of the Selected Companies were based on publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\nForward Sales Multiples\n75th \nPercentile\n25th \nPercentile\nMean\nMedian\n\u201824E\n8.7x\n2.2x\n5.7x\n4.5x\n\u201825E\n5.5x\n2.0x\n3.5x\n3.0x\n\u201826E\n3.6x\n1.7x\n2.5x\n2.4x\nBased on the multiples it derived for the Selected Companies and based on its professional judgment and experience,\nEvercore applied a forward multiple reference range of 2.0x - 4.0x to Arena\u2019s estimated 2026 revenue based on the\nProjections. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, Arena\u2019s estimated net debt (calculated as total debt less\ncash and cash equivalents) as of December 10, 2021, and the number of fully diluted shares of common stock, in each\ncase as provided by Arena senior management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of\ncommon stock of $42.30 to $69.75, compared to the Merger Consideration.\nAlthough none of the Selected Companies is directly comparable to Arena, Evercore selected these companies\nbecause they are publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies that Evercore, in its professional judgment and\nexperience, considered generally relevant to Arena for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating the Selected\nCompanies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market\nconditions affecting the Selected Companies and other matters, as well as differences in the Selected Companies\u2019\nfinancial, business and operating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not\nentirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat could affect the relative values of the Selected Companies and the multiples derived from the Selected\nCompanies. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of\nusing the data of the Selected Companies.\nPremiums Paid Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, Evercore reviewed ten transactions and announced all-cash bids for control of\nU.S. public biopharmaceutical targets with an aggregate transaction value between $5 billion and $10 billion\nannounced since 2015. Using publicly available information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage\nby which the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each such transaction exceeded (a) the closing\nmarket share prices of the target companies one day, and (b) the volume weighted average price thirty (30) and sixty\n(60) days, in each case prior to the announcement of each transaction.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\n \n1-Day \nClosing\nPrice\n30-\nDay \nVWAP\n60-Day\nVWAP\n25th Percentile\n45%\n49%\n57%\nMedian\n62%\n61%\n58%\nMean\n62%\n61%\n66%\n75th Percentile\n78%\n73%\n74%\nBased on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a premium range\nof 45% to 80% to the closing price per share of common stock of $49.94 as of December 10, 2021. This analysis\nindicated a range of implied equity values per share of common stock of $72.40 to $89.90, compared to the Merger\nConsideration.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the\nanalyses or data presented by Evercore to the Board of Directors. In connection with the review of the Merger by the\nBoard of Directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its\nopinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial\nanalysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without\nconsidering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore\u2019s\nopinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of all the analyses and did not draw,\nin isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its\nopinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and\nexperience after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses\nand factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or\nless probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or\ncombination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual\nvalue of the shares of common stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling the\ntotal of the figures shown.\nEvercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Board of Directors as to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of shares of common stock. These\nanalyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the business or securities\nactually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future\nresults, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly,\nestimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore\u2019s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty,\nand Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in such\nestimates.\nEvercore\u2019s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Board of\nDirectors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of\nEvercore\u2019s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEvercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Board of Directors or Arena senior\nmanagement or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the\nMerger for the holders of common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of Evercore\u2019s engagement letter with Arena, Arena has agreed to pay Evercore a fee for its\nservices in the amount of approximately $36.6 million, of which $2 million was paid upon delivery of Evercore\u2019s\nopinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company\nhas also agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses and to indemnify Evercore against certain liabilities arising out\nof its engagement.\nDuring the two (2) year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to\nprovide financial advisory or other services to Arena, and Evercore has not received any compensation from Arena\nduring such period. In addition, during the two (2) year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its\naffiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Pfizer, and Evercore has not\nreceived any compensation from Pfizer during such period. Evercore may provide financial advisory or other services\nto Arena and Pfizer in the future, and in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.\nEvercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of\ncustomers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity,\nplacement agent, asset management and related activities.

            "text": "Opinion of Guggenheim Securities, LLC\nOverview\nThe Board of Directors retained Guggenheim Securities as its financial advisor, including in connection with Arena\u2019s\npossible Merger with Pfizer.

information used in arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities noted that:\n\u2022\nGuggenheim Securities relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness and reasonableness of all\nindustry, business, financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, actuarial and other information provided by\nor discussed with Arena (including, without limitation, the Arena-Provided Information) or obtained from\npublic sources, data suppliers and other third parties.\n\u2022\nGuggenheim Securities (i) did not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy,\ncompleteness, reasonableness, achievability or independent verification of, and Guggenheim Securities did\nnot independently verify, any such information (including, without limitation, the Arena-Provided\nInformation), (ii) expressed no view or opinion regarding the (a) reasonableness or achievability of the\nProjections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information or the assumptions upon which\nany of the foregoing are based or (b) reasonableness of the probability adjustments reflected in the\nProjections and (iii) relied upon the assurances of Arena\u2019s senior management that they were unaware of\nany facts or circumstances that would make the Arena-Provided Information incomplete, inaccurate or\nmisleading.\n\u2022\nSpecifically, with respect to (i) the Projections utilized in Guggenheim Securities\u2019 analyses, (a) Guggenheim\nSecurities was advised by Arena\u2019s senior management, and Guggenheim Securities assumed, that the\nProjections (including the probability adjustments reflected therein and the expected development and\ncommercialization of Arena\u2019s products and product candidates), had been reasonably prepared on bases\nreflecting the best then-currently available estimates and judgments of Arena\u2019s senior management as to\nthe expected future performance of Arena on a stand-alone basis and (b) Guggenheim Securities assumed\nthat the Projections had been reviewed by the Board of Directors with the understanding that such\ninformation would be used and relied upon by Guggenheim Securities in connection with rendering its\nopinion and (ii) any financial projections/forecasts, other estimates and/or other forward-looking\ninformation obtained by Guggenheim Securities from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties,\nGuggenheim Securities assumed that such information was reasonable and reliable.\nGuggenheim Securities also noted certain other considerations with respect to its engagement and the rendering of\nits opinion:\n\u2022\nDuring the course of its engagement, Guggenheim Securities was asked by the Board of Directors to solicit\nindications of interest from various potential strategic acquirors regarding a potential extraordinary\ncorporate transaction with or involving Arena, and Guggenheim Securities considered the results of such\nsolicitation process in rendering its opinion.\n\u2022\nGuggenheim Securities did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities\n(including any contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet

representations and warranties of Arena and Pfizer contained in the\nMerger Agreement were true and correct and all conditions to the obligations of each party to the Merger\nAgreement to consummate the Merger would be satisfied without any waiver, amendment or modification\nthereof\u037e and\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nThe Merger will be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement\nand in compliance with all applicable legal and other requirements, without any delays, limitations,\nrestrictions, conditions, waivers, amendments or modifications (regulatory, tax-related or otherwise) that\nwould have an effect on Arena or the Merger in any way meaningful to Guggenheim Securities\u2019 analyses\nand opinion.\n\u2022\nGuggenheim Securities did not express any view or opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the\ncommon stock or other securities or financial instruments of or relating to Arena may trade or otherwise

Analyses\u201d presents a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by\nGuggenheim Securities and presented to the Board of Directors in connection with Guggenheim Securities\u2019 rendering\nof its opinion. Such presentation to the Board of Directors was supplemented by Guggenheim Securities\u2019 oral\ndiscussion with the Board of Directors, the nature and substance of which may not be fully described herein.\nSome of the financial analyses summarized below include summary data and information presented in tabular format.\nIn order to understand fully such financial analyses, the summary data and tables must be read together with the full\ntext of the summary. Considering the summary data and tables alone could create a misleading or incomplete view of\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 financial analyses.\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to\nthe most appropriate and relevant financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular\ncircumstances involved. A fairness opinion therefore is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary\ndescription, and taking portions of the financial analyses set forth below, without considering such analyses as a\nwhole, would in Guggenheim Securities\u2019 view create an incomplete and misleading picture of the processes\nunderlying the financial analyses considered in rendering Guggenheim Securities\u2019 opinion.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities:\n\u2022\nbased its financial analyses on various assumptions, including assumptions concerning general economic,\nbusiness and capital markets conditions and industry-specific and company-specific factors, all of which\nare beyond the control of Arena, Pfizer and Guggenheim Securities\u037e\n\u2022\ndid not form a view or opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor, whether positive or negative,\nconsidered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion\u037e\n\u2022\nconsidered the results of all of its financial analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any one\nanalysis or factor\u037e and\n\u2022\nultimately arrived at its opinion based on the results of all of its financial analyses assessed as a whole and\nbelieves that the totality of the factors considered and the various financial analyses performed by\nGuggenheim Securities in connection with its opinion operated collectively to support its determination as\nto the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of such opinion, of the Merger\nConsideration to be received by holders of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement to the extent\nexpressly specified in such opinion.\nWith respect to the financial analyses performed by Guggenheim Securities in connection with rendering its opinion:\n\u2022\nSuch financial analyses, particularly those based on estimates and projections, are not necessarily\nindicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by these analyses.\n\u2022\nNone of the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions used in the selected precedent merger\nand acquisition transactions analysis described below is identical or directly comparable to the Merger\u037e\nhowever, such transactions were selected by Guggenheim Securities, among other reasons, because they\ninvolved target companies which may be considered broadly similar, for purposes of Guggenheim\nSecurities\u2019 financial analyses, to Arena based on Guggenheim Securities\u2019 professional judgment and\nexperience with the biopharmaceutical sector.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nIn any event, selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis is not purely mathematical\u037e\nrather, such analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in\nbusiness, operating, financial and capital markets-related characteristics and other factors regarding the\nselected precedent merger and acquisition transactions to which the Merger was compared.\n\u2022\nSuch financial analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which any securities may\ntrade at the present time or at any time in the future.\nCertain Definitions\nThroughout this \u201cSummary of Financial Analyses,\u201d the following defined terms

Guggenheim Securities performed a stand-alone financing-adjusted\ndiscounted cash flow analysis of Arena based on projected, risk-adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows for\nArena and an estimate of its terminal/continuing value at the end of the projection period.\nIn performing its discounted cash flow analyses with respect to Arena:\n\u2022\nGuggenheim Securities based its financing-adjusted discounted cash flow analysis of Arena on the\nProjections.\n\u2022\nGuggenheim Securities used a discount rate range of 8.00% - 9.75% based on its estimate of Arena\u2019s\nweighted average cost of capital.\n\u2022\nIn estimating Arena\u2019s terminal/continuing value, Guggenheim Securities used a perpetual growth rate of\nnegative 70% (as provided and approved for Guggenheim Securities\u2019 use by Arena\u2019s senior management)\napplied to Arena\u2019s terminal year normalized after-tax unlevered free cash flow.\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 financing-adjusted discounted cash flow analyses resulted in an overall reference range of\n$86.00 - $107.00 per share (rounded to the nearest $1.00) for purposes of evaluating the equity value per share of the\ncommon stock on a stand-alone intrinsic-value basis.\nArena Selected Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transactions Analysis. Guggenheim Securities reviewed and\nanalyzed certain financial metrics associated with selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions involving\ncompanies in the biopharmaceutical sector that Guggenheim Securities deemed relevant in its professional judgment\nfor purposes of this analysis. Guggenheim Securities calculated, among other things and to the extent publicly\navailable, certain implied change-of-control transaction multiples for the selected precedent merger and acquisition\ntransactions (based on each company\u2019s most recent publicly available financial filings and certain other publicly\navailable information), which are summarized in the table below:\nSelected Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transactions Analysis\nDate\nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget Company\nT+5 Revenue \nMultiple\n09/30/21\nMerck & Co.\nAcceleron Pharma Inc.\n6.5x\n10/05/20\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company\nMyoKardia, Inc.\n14.8\n08/19/20\nJohnson & Johnson\nMomenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n8.5\n03/02/20\nGilead Sciences, Inc.\nForty Seven, Inc.\n7.0\n11/24/19\nNovartis AG\nThe Medicines Co.\n6.2\n01/07/19\nEli Lilly and Company\nLoxo Oncology, Inc.\n10.3\n01/29/18\nSanofi S.A.\nAblynx NV\n6.7\n01/22/18\nCelgene Corporation\nJuno Therapeutics, Inc.\n4.0\n05/16/16\nPfizer Inc.\nAnacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n4.1\n08/24/14\nRoche Holding AG\nInterMune, Inc.\n5.0\nArena/Pfizer Merger\n6.4x\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn performing its selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis with respect to Arena, Guggenheim\nSecurities selected a reference range of T+5 Revenue Multiples of 5.3x to 8.1x (based on the 25th and 75th percentile\nrange) for purposes of evaluating the Company on a change-of-control basis.\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis resulted in an overall\nreference range of $86.00 - $123.00 per share (rounded to the closest $1.00) for purposes of evaluating the common\nstock on a change of control basis.\nOther Financial Reviews and Analyses Solely for Informational Reference Purposes\nIn order to provide certain context for the financial analyses in connection with its opinion as described above,\nGuggenheim Securities undertook various additional financial reviews and analyses as summarized below solely for\ninformational reference purposes. As a general matter, Guggenheim Securities did not consider such additional\nfinancial reviews and analyses to be determinative methodologies for purposes of its opinion.\nArena Stock Price Trading History. Guggenheim Securities reviewed the common stock price trading history for the\n52 weeks ending December 10, 2021, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger. The common stock\ntraded in a range of $45.50 (on August 19, 2021) - $85.00 (on February 16, 2021) per share.\nArena Wall Street Equity Research Analyst Stock Price Targets. Guggenheim Securities reviewed selected Wall Street\nequity research analyst stock price targets for Arena as published prior to December 10, 2021. Guggenheim Securities\nnoted that such Wall Street equity research analyst stock price targets for common stock were $71.00 - $120.00 per\nshare.\nPremia Paid in Selected Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transactions. Guggenheim Securities reviewed, based\non publicly available information, the implied premia paid or proposed to be paid in connection with selected\nprecedent merger and acquisition transactions. Guggenheim Securities noted that such precedent M&A transaction-\nrelated premia ranged from (i) 49% -67% for transactions with enterprise values between $5-$15 billion and (ii) 57% -\n110% for transactions with enterprise values between $2-$20 billion (each based on the 25th to 75th percentile range),\nbased on the target company\u2019s unaffected spot closing stock price. Guggenheim Securities further noted that, in\nconnection with the Merger, the Merger-implied premium (based on the Merger Consideration) was 100% versus\nArena\u2019s spot closing stock price of $49.94 on December 10, 2021 (the last trading day prior to the announcement of\nthe Merger).\nOther Considerations\nExcept as described in the summary above, Arena did not provide specific instructions to, or place any limitations on,\nGuggenheim Securities with respect to the procedures to be followed or factors to be considered in performing its\nfinancial analyses or providing its opinion. The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger were\ndetermined through negotiations between Arena and Pfizer and were approved by the Board of Directors. The\ndecision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board of Directors. Guggenheim Securities\u2019\nopinion was just one of the many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors. Consequently,\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 financial analyses should not be viewed as determinative of the view of the Board of\nDirectors with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by\nthe holders of common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of Guggenheim Securities\u2019 engagement letter, Arena has agreed to pay Guggenheim Securities a\ncash transaction fee (based on a percentage of the aggregate value associated with the Merger) upon consummation\nof the Merger, which cash transaction fee currently is estimated to be $36.6 million. Arena has previously paid\nGuggenheim Securities a cash milestone fee of $2 million that became payable upon the rendering of Guggenheim\nSecurities\u2019 opinion with respect to the Merger, which will be credited against the foregoing cash transaction fee. In\naddition, Arena has agreed to reimburse Guggenheim Securities for certain expenses and indemnify Guggenheim\nSecurities against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.\nIn the two (2) years prior to the date of its written opinion, Guggenheim Securities has been engaged by Arena in\nconnection with various matters unrelated to the Merger, none of which resulted in a closed transaction or receipt by\nGuggenheim Securities of any compensation. At the request of the Board of Directors, Guggenheim Securities\nprovided information about its relationships with Pfizer over the last five (5) years. During the five-year period prior\nto the date of its written opinion, Guggenheim Securities has been engaged by Pfizer with respect to various matters\nunrelated to the Merger, including the following, in respect of which Guggenheim Securities received compensation:\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPfizer\u2019s (i) carve-out of its Upjohn unit and the merger of Upjohn with Mylan N.V., (ii) divestiture of its Magnesia\nBisurada subsidiary in Brazil, (iii) joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline, (iv) acquisition of Array BioPharma Inc. and (v)\nsale of its Hospira Infusion Systems business. Guggenheim Securities received compensation of approximately $110\nmillion to $115 million in the aggregate from Pfizer during this five (5)-year period.\nGuggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for\nits and their own accounts and the accounts of customers, including but not limited to: asset, investment and wealth\nmanagement\u037e insurance services\u037e investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring\u037e\nmerchant banking\u037e fixed income and equity sales, trading and research\u037e and derivatives, foreign exchange and\nfutures.

Furthermore, Guggenheim Securities and its\naffiliates and related entities and its or their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents may\nhave investments in Arena, Pfizer, other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates.\nConsistent with applicable legal and regulatory guidelines, Guggenheim Securities has adopted certain policies and\nprocedures to establish and maintain the independence of its research departments and personnel. As a result,\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 research analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and\npublish research reports with respect to Arena, Pfizer, other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates\nand the Merger that differ from the views of Guggenheim Securities\u2019 investment banking personnel.\nInterests of Arena\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger\nthat are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally, as more fully described below.

The table also sets\nforth the values of these shares and equity awards, determined as the number of shares multiplied by the Merger\nConsideration (minus the applicable per share exercise price for any Arena Options and assuming that the\nperformance-based vesting conditions associated with such Arena PRSUs are achieved at target).

Stockholders should be aware that the fair\nvalue of their shares could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration and that an investment\nbanking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction,\nsuch as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the\nDGCL. Any stockholder contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should review carefully the provisions of\nSection 262 of the DGCL, particularly the procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights.\nThe following is a summary of the procedures to be followed by stockholders that wish to exercise their appraisal\nrights under Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached to this proxy as Annex D. This summary\ndoes not purport to be a complete statement of, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, Section 262 of the\nDGCL. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder\nof shares immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person\nholding a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee,\nmust act promptly to cause the stockholder of record to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely\nmanner to perfect appraisal rights. Failure to follow any of the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL may result\nin termination or waiver of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders should assume that\nArena will take no action to perfect any appraisal rights of any stockholder.\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAny stockholder who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the\nDGCL and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The\nfollowing summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that Arena\nstockholders exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of the\nstockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of the\nstockholders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the\napproval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or\nseries of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL.\nThis proxy statement constitutes the formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and the\nrequired copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. Any stockholder who\nwishes to exercise such appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so should review the\nfollowing discussion and Annex D carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures\nspecified may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nIf a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\ndeliver to Arena a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Arena common stock prior to the taking of\nthe vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, which written demand must reasonably inform us of the identity\nof the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. This\nwritten demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or\nvoting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d or failing to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning\nof Section 262 of the DGCL\u037e\n\u2022\nnot vote, or abstain from voting, his, her or its shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\ncontinuously hold of record the shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made\nthrough the Effective Time of the Merger\u037e and\n\u2022\ncomply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights thereafter, including\nfiling of a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of your\nshares of common stock within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger.\nWithin ten (10) days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will provide notice of the\neffective date of the Merger to those stockholders of Arena who have properly made a written demand for appraisal\npursuant to the first bullet above, as required by Section 262 of the DGCL, has not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and has not withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal. If the Merger is consummated,\na failure to make a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the time periods specified in the first bullet above\n(or to take any of the other steps specified in the above bullets) will be deemed to be a waiver or a termination of your\nappraisal rights. At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time of the Merger, any stockholder who has\ndemanded an appraisal, but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named\nparty, has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration, without interest, specified by\nthe Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares. Any attempt to withdraw made more than sixty (60) days after the\nEffective Time of the Merger will require the written approval of the Surviving Corporation and no appraisal\nproceeding before the Delaware Court of Chancery as to any stockholder will be dismissed without the approval of\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned upon any terms the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndeems just\u037e provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any stockholder that has made an\nappraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party\nto withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within sixty (60)\ndays after the Effective Time of the Merger. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a stockholder\u2019s request to\nwithdraw a demand for appraisal when the approval is required or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not\napprove the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder would be entitled to receive only the appraised\nvalue determined in any such appraisal proceeding. This value could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the\nvalue of the Merger Consideration.\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWritten Demand by the Stockholder\nAll written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 136 Heber Avenue, Suite 204,\nPark City, Utah 84060. Attention: General Counsel. The demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the\nstockholder of record, fully and correctly, as such stockholder\u2019s name appears on the stockholder\u2019s certificates\n(whether in book entry or on physical certificates) evidencing such stockholder\u2019s shares. If the shares are owned of\nrecord in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be made in that\ncapacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,\nthe demand must be made by or for all owners of record. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners,\nmay execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record, but such agent must identify the record owner or\nowners and expressly disclose in such demand that the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners of\nsuch shares.\nA beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions\nas may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the stockholder of record. If\nshares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the shares through a central\nsecurities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on\nbehalf of the depository nominee, and must identify the depository nominee as the stockholder of record. Any\nbeneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights and holds shares through a nominee holder is responsible\nfor ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the stockholder of record. The beneficial holder of the\nshares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the stockholder of record\nof the shares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares have been so deposited.\nA record stockholder, such as a broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, who holds shares as a nominee\nfor several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial\nowners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners. In such case, the\nwritten demand for appraisal must set forth the number of shares covered by such demand. Unless a demand for\nappraisal specifies a number of shares, such demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of such\nstockholder.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any\nstockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal rights who did not vote their\nshares in favor of the Merger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares. If no such petition is filed within that\n120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all stockholders who had previously demanded appraisal of their\nshares. None of Pfizer, Merger Sub or Arena, as the Surviving Corporation, has any obligation to or has any present\nintention to file a petition and stockholders should not assume that any of the foregoing parties will file a petition or\nwill initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the\nstockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares within the period\nprescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the\nDGCL and the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nSurviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and with respect to which Arena has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of stockholders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within ten (10) days after a written request\ntherefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for\ndelivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement that a demand for\nappraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of the shares, a person who is the beneficial owner of\nshares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to which demand has been\nproperly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person's own name, file a petition for appraisal or request\nfrom the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by any stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving\nCorporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after receiving service of a\ncopy of the petition to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (the \u201cVerified List\u201d) containing\nthe names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares (the \u201cDissenting\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStockholders\u201d) and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares has not been reached. Upon the filing of a\npetition by a Dissenting Stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order a hearing and that notice of the time\nand place fixed for the hearing on the petition will be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all the Dissenting\nStockholders shown on the Verified List. Notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the\nhearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication\ndeemed advisable by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs relating to these notices will be borne by the\nSurviving Corporation.\nIf a hearing on the petition is held, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to determine which Dissenting\nStockholders have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and are entitled to an appraisal of their\nshares. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require that Dissenting Stockholders submit their share certificates, if\nany, to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. The\nDelaware Court of Chancery is empowered to dismiss the proceedings as to any Dissenting Stockholder who does\nnot comply with such requirement. Accordingly, Dissenting Stockholders are cautioned to retain their share\ncertificates after the Effective Time and thereafter comply with all orders of the Delaware Court of Chancery in respect\nof such certificates. In addition, assuming the shares remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately\nbefore the Effective Time, which we expect to be the case, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to dismiss the\nappraisal proceedings as to all Dissenting Stockholders unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal\nexceeds one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration\nprovided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal\nproceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules\nspecifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndetermine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from\nthe effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will\naccrue at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time\nto time during the period between the Effective Time of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment.\nHowever, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each\nHowever, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each\nstockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of\n(i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid by the Surviving Corporation and the fair value of the shares as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless\npaid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.\nUOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in\nan appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201cfair price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery must consider market\nvalue, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be\nascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. In\nWeinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,\nmay be considered.\u201d Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware\nSupreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion that does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d\nbut which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation.\nAn opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration\npayable in a merger is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. You should be aware that the\nfair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than\nthe merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement.\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or by stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final\ndetermination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the Verified List\nand who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s stock certificates, if any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery, if such is\nrequired, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to\nappraisal rights. When the fair value of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the\npayment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled thereto, forthwith in the case of\nuncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders of their stock certificates. The Delaware\nCourt of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may also (i) determine the costs of the proceeding (which do not include attorneys\u2019\nfees or the fees and expenses of experts) and tax such costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndeems equitable and (ii) upon application of a stockholder, order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any\nDissenting Stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 fees and fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to\nappraisal. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses. Determinations by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nStockholders considering whether to seek appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined\nunder Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration to\nbe paid in the Merger. Although Arena believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to\nthe outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Neither Pfizer nor Arena\nanticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Dissenting Stockholder, and each of Pfizer and Arena\nreserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d\nof the shares is less than the Merger Consideration.\nThe process of dissenting and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with technical prerequisites.\nStockholders wishing to exercise their appraisal rights should consult with their own legal counsel in connection with\ncompliance with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nAny stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL\nwill not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote his or her shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of\ndividends or other distributions thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders as of a date\nprior to the Effective Time.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully\nwithdraws or loses such stockholder\u2019s right to appraisal, such stockholder\u2019s shares will be deemed to have been\nconverted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or\neffectively lose, the stockholder's right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the\neffective date of the Merger. Inasmuch as Arena has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present intention\nto do so, any stockholder who desires such a petition is advised to file it on a timely basis. In addition, a stockholder\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her\nor its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and accept the Merger Consideration by\ndelivering to Arena a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for appraisal and acceptance of the terms of\nthe Merger either within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with the written approval of\nArena. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed\nas to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be\nconditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that the limitation\nset forth in this sentence will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding\nor joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nMerger Consideration within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger.`\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL\nNOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL\nRECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.\nThe foregoing summary of the rights of the stockholders of Arena to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does\nnot purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by the stockholders of Arena desiring\n60\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the\nDGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. A\ncopy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement.\nAccounting Treatment\nThe Merger will be accounted for as a \u201cpurchase transaction\u201d for financial accounting purposes.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be\nrelevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) whose shares are converted into the right to\nreceive cash pursuant to the Merger. This summary is general in nature and does not purport to be a complete\nanalysis of all potential tax effects. The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any\napplicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions,\npublished rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), and other\napplicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or\ndiffering interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to stockholders who\nhold their shares of common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,\nproperty held for investment purposes).\nThis discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant\nto stockholders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address the tax\nconsequences that may be relevant to stockholders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal\nincome tax laws, such as:\n\u2022\nbanks, mutual funds, insurance companies or other financial institutions\u037e\n\u2022\ntax-exempt organizations\u037e\n\u2022\nretirement or other tax deferred accounts\u037e\n\u2022\nS corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through\nentities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or other pass-through entities) or an investor in a partnership,\nS corporation (or other pass-through entity)\u037e\n\u2022\ndealers in stocks and securities\u037e traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of\naccounting for their securities\u037e\n\u2022\nregulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts\u037e\n\u2022\nentities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nexcept as noted below, stockholders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five\npercent (5%) or more of Arena\u2019s common stock (by vote or value)\u037e\n\u2022\nstockholders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk\nreduction transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nstockholders whose shares constitute qualified small business stock within the meaning of Section 1202 of\nthe Code\u037e\n\u2022\nstockholders that received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax\nqualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants\u037e\n\u2022\nstockholders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Pfizer or the Surviving Corporation\nfollowing the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. Holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\nstockholders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch\nthereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States\u037e\n61\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nstockholders subject to the Medicare tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax\u037e\n\u2022\nstockholders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to\nthe shares of common stock being taken into account in an \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d (as defined in\nthe Code)\u037e\n\u2022\nstockholders who are controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies or\ncorporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax\u037e or\n\u2022\ntax consequences to stockholders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and properly demand appraisal of\ntheir shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such\npartnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.\nPartnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the\nconsequences of the Merger.\nWe have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the\nconclusions reached in the following summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views\nexpressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.\nTHE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX\nPLANNING. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC\nTAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX\nCONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is (or is treated as) a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of\none or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) that has a valid\nelection in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of common stock that is not a U.S. Holder\nnor an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares\nsurrendered pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of shares (that is,\nshares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the\namount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the\ncompletion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers are currently taxed at preferential U.S.\nfederal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNon-U.S. Holders\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States\n(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed\nbase maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder\nis a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or\na lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the Merger, and certain other requirements are met, in which case such gain will be subject\nto U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax\ntreaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder if the Non-\nU.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses\u037e or\n\u2022\nArena is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is defined in Section\n897(c) of the Code (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the shorter of the five (5)-year period preceding the\nMerger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock\n(the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d) and, if shares of Arena\u2019s common stock are regularly traded on an established\nsecurities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns directly\nor is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than five percent (5%) of our common stock at any\ntime during the Relevant Period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates\ngenerally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch\nprofits tax will not apply. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not,\nand have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five (5)-year period preceding the Merger.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%)) may apply to the\nproceeds received by a stockholder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S.\nHolder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such stockholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a\ncertification of such stockholder\u2019s foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or\nsuccessor form) or (ii) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit\nagainst the stockholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to\nthe IRS.\nWithholding on Foreign Entities\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (\u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) on\ncertain payments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under these rules) unless such\ninstitution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and\nprovide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution\n(which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign\nentities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of\nthirty percent (30%) on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the\nwithholding agent with either a certification that it does not have any substantial direct or indirect U.S. owners or\nprovides information regarding substantial direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity. An intergovernmental\nagreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. FATCA\nwithholding currently applies to payments of dividends. The Treasury Department has released proposed regulations\nwhich, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) applicable\nto the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed\nregulations, the Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final\nregulations are issued.\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStockholders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on\nthe disposition of common stock pursuant to the Merger.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

            "text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nArena and Pfizer have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to\nconsummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, subject to certain\nlimitations as set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nHSR Act and Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain acquisitions may not be completed until\ninformation has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the Federal\nTrade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and the applicable HSR Act waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act applicable to the Merger is thirty (30) calendar days, unless the waiting period is\nterminated earlier or extended. If the DOJ or FTC issues a request for additional information and documentary\nmaterials (which we refer to as a \u201cSecond Request\u201d), the parties must observe a second thirty (30)-day waiting period,\nwhich would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with such Second Request, unless the\nwaiting period is terminated earlier or the parties agree with the DOJ or FTC to delay consummation of the merger for\na specified period of time.\nThe Merger is subject to the provisions of the HSR Act and therefore cannot be completed until each of Arena and\nPfizer file a notification and report form with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting\nperiod has expired or been terminated.\nThe Merger is also conditioned on the expiration or termination of any agreement not to consummate the Merger with\nany governmental body, and the receipt of any requisite approvals or clearances under the Antitrust Laws and\ncompetition laws of other jurisdictions that may initiate or commence or merger control inquiry and for which\napproval or clearance is deemed applicable to the Merger. This includes Austria and Germany unless the relevant\njurisdiction declines, does not assert or defers jurisdiction\u037e the United Kingdom if it opens an investigation or\nrequires that a merger notification be made\u037e and the European Union if the European Commission accepts a referral\nrequest.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the Antitrust Laws as it deems\nnecessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets of one or both of the parties, requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets\nor terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to agree to other remedies. At any\ntime before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, any state or foreign jurisdiction could take such action under the Antitrust Laws as it\ndeems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the\nMerger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of one or both of the parties, requiring the parties to license or hold\nseparate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to agree to other\nremedies. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the Antitrust Laws under certain circumstances,\nincluding by seeking to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any\nof which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. We cannot be\ncertain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that\nthese regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these\nregulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions, restrictions,\nqualifications, requirements or limitations on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest\nassets, license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or agree to other\nremedies, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the\nconditions to the Merger not being satisfied. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of\nthe required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a\nsubstantial period of time between the approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.\n64TABLE OF CONTENTS\nArena and Pfizer have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to\nconsummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, subject to certain\nlimitations as set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nLegal Proceedings",

            "text": "Annex B\nDecember 12, 2021\nThe Board of Directors\nArena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n6154 Nancy Ridge Drive\nSan Diego, CA 92121\nMembers of the Board of Directors:\nWe understand that Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d), proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of\nMerger, dated as of December 12, 2021 (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), with Pfizer Inc. (the \u201cAcquiror\u201d) and Antioch\nMerger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (the \u201cMerger Sub\u201d). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,\nthe Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation as a wholly\nowned subsidiary of the Acquiror (the \u201cMerger\u201d). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of common\nstock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d), other than shares to be\ncancelled pursuant to section 2.1(b) of the Merger Agreement and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger\nAgreement), will be converted into the right to receive $100 per share in cash (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). The\nterms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nThe Board of Directors has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Consideration to be received by holders of the\nCompany Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nIn connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:\n(i)\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we\ndeemed to be relevant\u037e\n(ii)\nreviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us by\nmanagement of the Company, as approved for our use by the Company (the \u201cProjections\u201d)\u037e\n(iii)\ndiscussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of the\nCompany, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Projections\u037e\n(iv)\nreviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock\u037e\n(v)\ncompared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of\ncertain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant\u037e\n(vi)\ncompared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger\nwith the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we deemed\nrelevant\u037e\n(vii)\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, dated December 12, 2021\u037e and\n(viii) performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed\nappropriate.\nFor purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the\nfinancial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to,\ndiscussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed\nresponsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further relied upon the\nassurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would\nmake such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Projections, we have assumed with your consent\nthat they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith\njudgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and the other\nmatters covered thereby. We express no view as to the Projections or the assumptions on which they are based.\nFor purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the\nrepresentations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party\nwill perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement and that all\nconditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. We have\nfurther assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents,\napprovals\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nor releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or\ncondition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the Merger or reduce the\ncontemplated benefits to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the Merger.\nWe have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and have not made or\nassumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including\nany contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company, nor have we been\nfurnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company\nunder any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based\nupon information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as\nthey exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect this\nopinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.\nWe have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to\nthe holders of the Company Common Stock, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration. We do not\nexpress any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any\nconsideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or\npayable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative\nto the Merger Consideration or otherwise. We have not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our\nopinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without\nlimitation, the structure or form of the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Our\nopinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that\nmight be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage\nin the Merger. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors or to any other persons in\nrespect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of the Company Common Stock should act or vote in\nrespect of the Merger. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Company Common\nStock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the\nCompany or the Merger or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability\nof the Company to pay its obligations when they come due. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts\nand have assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to\nlegal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our\nservices, a portion of which is payable upon rendering this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent\nupon the consummation of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse our expenses and to indemnify us\nagainst certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
