Each holder of common stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each such\nshare of common stock owned at the close of business on the Record Date on all matters properly coming before the\nSpecial Meeting.

Because the required vote for\nthe proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is based on the number of votes our stockholders are entitled to cast\nrather than on the number of votes actually cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy or vote online at the meeting\n(including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as\nvotes cast \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. As of August 24, 2021, the Record Date for the Special Meeting,\n33,428,881 shares constitute a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock.\nUnder our bylaws, approval of Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal each require the affirmative\nvote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present virtually in person or represented by proxy at the Special\nMeeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory (non-\nbinding) and is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.\nAn abstention represents a stockholder\u2019s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder\nabstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal\nto adopt the Merger Agreement and \u201cAGAINST\u201d the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the\nCompensation Proposal. For stockholders who attend the virtual meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain\nfrom voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment\nProposal. As a result, an abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will be counted for purposes of\ndetermining the presence or absence of a quorum and will also count as votes against such proposal.\nEach \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will\nhave no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d generally occurs\nwhen a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank,\nbroker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares.\n\u201cBroker non-votes,\u201d if any, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However,\nbecause none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have\ndiscretionary authority to vote, Cornerstone does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. As such, if\nyou fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted\ntowards a quorum at the Special Meeting.\nShares Held by Cornerstone\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers",

Guests may enter the Special Meeting in \u201clisten-only\u201d mode by\nentering the Special Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CSOD2021SM and entering the information\nrequested in the \u201cGuest Login\u201d section. Guests will not have the ability to vote or ask questions at the Special\nMeeting.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $57.50 in cash,\nwithout interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes required by applicable law, for each share of\ncommon stock that you own immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you are entitled to and have properly\nexercised and not withdrawn, failed to perfect or otherwise lost your appraisal rights under Section 262 of the\nDGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will receive $5,750.00 in cash in exchange for\nyour shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes required by applicable law. You will not\nreceive any shares of the capital stock in the Surviving Corporation.\nQ:\nWhat will holders of Company stock awards receive if the Merger is consummated?\nA:\nEffective as of the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU, Vested Company Option and Director RSU will be\ncancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the\naggregate number of shares subject to such award, multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, for\neach Company Option, the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over such Company Option\u2019s\nper share exercise price), subject to any required withholding of taxes.\nEffective as of the Effective Time, each Unvested Award will be cancelled and automatically converted into the\nright to receive the Unvested Consideration Amount, which Unvested Consideration Amount will be made at\nthe same time(s) that the Unvested Awards would have vested in accordance with their terms and will remain\nsubject to the holder of the Unvested Awards remaining in continuous service with Parent, the Surviving\nCorporation or any of its Subsidiaries through each such vesting date (except, that any terms and conditions\nrelating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder\u2019s employment in connection with or following\nthe Merger will continue to apply to the Unvested Consideration Amount).\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. In order to complete the merger, the\nCompany must obtain the stockholder approval described in this proxy statement, and the other closing\nconditions under the Merger Agreement must be satisfied or waived. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary\nclosing conditions, including the approval by stockholders of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, we\ncurrently anticipate that the Merger will be consummated during the second half of 2021, although the Company\ncannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. Since the Merger is subject to a number of conditions,\nthe exact timing of the Merger cannot be determined at this time.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,\nstockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Cornerstone will remain an\nindependent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and\nregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified\ncircumstances, Cornerstone will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $150,000,000 upon the termination\nof the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption\nof the Merger Agreement-Termination Fee.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding\nas of the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed\nproxy card\u037e (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nenclosed proxy card)\u037e or (iii) vote virtually in person at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a\nquorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote\nyour shares will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a\nquorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nWhy are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation\nProposal?\nA:\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Cornerstone to seek an advisory (non-binding)\nvote with respect to certain payments that could become payable to certain of its executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or\nappropriate?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present virtually in person or\nrepresented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required for approval of\neach of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, and the Adjournment Proposal. If you\nfail to submit a proxy or to vote while virtually attending the Special Meeting, or if you vote \u201cABSTAIN,\u201d or if\nyou do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with voting instructions, it will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d each of the Compensation Proposal and Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with\nrespect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Cornerstone. Therefore, if\nthe other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable under\nthe Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Cornerstone\u2019s executive officers in accordance with\nthe terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\nQ:\nWhat is a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d?\nA:\nUnder the rules of the Nasdaq, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d for\ncustomers have the authority to vote on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d proposals when they have not received instructions\nfrom beneficial owners. However, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are precluded from exercising their\nvoting discretion with respect to approving non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares of\nCompany common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not empowered to vote those shares of\nCompany common stock on non-discretionary matters, which we refer to generally as \u201cbroker non-votes.\u201d\nBecause none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may\nhave discretionary authority to vote, the Company does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special\nMeeting.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,\nincluding, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this\nproxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects\nyou. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply\nenvelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided\nin the enclosed proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek\nappraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the\nvoting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nMay I exercise dissenters\u2019 rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nYes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the\nDGCL. Under Delaware law, stockholders of record who continuously hold shares of Cornerstone common stock\nthrough the Effective Time and do not vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to\nseek appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court if the Merger is completed.\nAppraisal rights will only be available to stockholders who properly deliver, and do not properly withdraw, a\nwritten demand for an appraisal to Cornerstone prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\nat the Special Meeting and who comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the\nDGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or\nless than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A\ncopy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement. For additional information, see\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Appraisal Rights.\u201d\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. A letter of transmittal will be mailed to you promptly, and in any event within three business days, after the\nEffective Time, describing how you should surrender your shares of Company common stock for the per share\nMerger Consideration. If your shares of Company common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your bank,\nbrokerage firm or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee\nas to how to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares of Company common stock in exchange for the\nper share Merger Consideration. Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I have lost my stock certificate?\nA:\nIf you have lost your stock certificate, please contact our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., at\n(800) 522-6645 or web.queries@computershare.com to obtain replacement certificates.\nQ:\nShould I surrender my book-entry shares now?\nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, the payment agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and\nwritten instructions that explain how to exchange shares of common stock represented by such holder\u2019s book-\nentry shares for Merger Consideration.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the\nSpecial Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger\nis expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before\nthe Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the\nperson to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Cornerstone in writing of\nsuch special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger consideration, if the Merger is\ncompleted, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those\nshares at the Special Meeting. You will also lose the ability to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the\nMerger with respect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common\nstock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the\naccompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the\ninstructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A.,\nyou are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this proxy\nstatement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Cornerstone.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of\nshares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by\nyour bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee\nhow to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special\nMeeting.

A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal\nexecutive offices located at 1601 Cloverfield Blvd., Suite 620 South, Santa Monica, California 90404, during regular\nbusiness hours for a period of no less than 10 days before the Special Meeting and will be available electronically at\nthe Special Meeting.\nThe holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present virtually in person\nor represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were\n66,857,760 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, meaning that 33,428,881\nshares of common stock must be represented virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting to have a quorum. In the\nevent that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit\nadditional proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nVote Required\u037e Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding as of\nthe Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. As of the Record Date, 33,428,881 shares constitute a\nmajority of the outstanding shares of common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders is a\ncondition to the Closing of the Merger.\nUnder our bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present virtually\nin person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required to\napprove, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the voting power of the shares present virtually in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting\nand entitled to vote on the subject matter.\nAn abstention represents a stockholder\u2019s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder\nabstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal\nto adopt the Merger Agreement and \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the\nCompensation Proposal. For stockholders who attend the virtual meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain\nfrom voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d any proposal to\nadjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional\n21TABLE OF CONTENTS\nproxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger\nAgreement at the time of the Special Meeting. As a result, an abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will\nbe counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum and will also count as votes against\nsuch proposal.\nEach \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will\nhave no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any Adjournment Proposal. A \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d generally occurs\nwhen a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank,\nbroker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares.\n\u201cBroker non-votes,\u201d if any, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However,\nbecause none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have\ndiscretionary authority to vote, Cornerstone does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. As such, if\nyou fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted\ntowards a quorum at the Special Meeting.\nShares Held by Cornerstone\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\nAs of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the\naggregate, 3,026,135 shares of common stock, representing approximately 4.5% of the shares of common stock\noutstanding on the Record Date (and approximately 7.5% of the shares of common stock outstanding when taking\ninto account Cornerstone options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers).\nOur directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their respective shares\nof common stock (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the approval, on an advisory (non-\nbinding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal, and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.",

        "Background of the Merger": {
            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Board of Directors, together with Cornerstone management, regularly reviews and assesses Cornerstone\u2019s\nperformance, share price, risks, opportunities and strategy in light of the current business and economic\nenvironment, as well as evolving industry dynamics, as they, individually and together, may affect Cornerstone\u2019s\nlong-term strategic goals and plans. As a matter of practice, the Board of Directors and Cornerstone management,\ntogether with their professional advisors, regularly review and evaluate a wide range of strategic opportunities for\nbusiness combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives for Cornerstone, including\ncontinuing as a standalone company, with a view to enhance stockholder value.\nOn February 2, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of\nCooley LLP (\u201cCooley\u201d), Cornerstone\u2019s outside legal counsel. Representatives of Cornerstone management reviewed\nwith the Board of Directors preliminary financial results with respect to Cornerstone\u2019s operations through the end of\nfiscal year 2020. At the request of the Board of Directors, representatives of\n26TABLE OF CONTENTS\nCenterview then joined the meeting to review with the Board of Directors general market observations based on\nrecent trends and Cornerstone\u2019s financial performance relative to other companies in the software industry in order to\ninform the Board of Directors\u2019 ongoing assessment of Cornerstone\u2019s long-term strategic plan. The Board of Directors\ninvited representatives of Centerview to join the meeting based on their experience and reputation in the software\nindustry and their long-standing relationship with Cornerstone, including their work with Cornerstone in connection\nwith the acquisition of Saba the prior year. Discussion ensued with respect to opportunities and challenges\nassociated with executing on Cornerstone\u2019s long-term strategic plan and other potential stockholder value enhancing\nopportunities, including potential financial and strategic partners for Cornerstone. The Board of Directors raised\nquestions around whether the public markets would appropriately value Cornerstone\u2019s ongoing execution of its long-\nterm strategic plan. Following discussion, the Board of Directors determined to have further discussion on these\ntopics at its next regularly scheduled meeting following the announcement on February 16, 2021 of results for the\nyear and fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 and gauging associated investor and market reaction.\nOn March 15, 2021, in preparation for the next meeting of the Board of Directors and upon the recommendation of\ncertain members of the Board of Directors, representatives of Cornerstone management met with representatives of\nQatalyst Partners to obtain an additional viewpoint on Cornerstone\u2019s financial and trading performance relative to\ncertain peer groups and the market generally, analyst perceptions of Cornerstone, the software market environment,\nand potential financial and strategic partners for Cornerstone from a financial advisor considered by Cornerstone\nmanagement to have significant experience with, and deep knowledge of, the software industry and its participants.\nOn March 17, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of\nCooley and Centerview. Cornerstone management reviewed with the Board of Directors general investor sentiment\nfollowing Cornerstone\u2019s announcement of earnings for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020, Cornerstone\u2019s\nhistorical stock price performance relative to certain peer groups and the market more generally, and Cornerstone\nmanagement\u2019s outlook (a) for the first quarter of 2021, which, based on current estimates, was expected to exceed\npublicly disclosed guidance, and (b) for full-year 2021, which remained in-line with Cornerstone\u2019s then current\ninternal forecasts. Representatives of Centerview reviewed reactions to Cornerstone\u2019s results for the fourth quarter\nended December 31, 2020 and management reviewed opportunities and challenges associated with executing on\nCornerstone\u2019s long-term standalone plan. Centerview noted that while software sector valuations remained at or near\nall-time highs and that strategic and financial buyers were aggressively pursuing high-growth assets, since the time\nof the last meeting of the Board of Directors on February 2, 2021 Nasdaq was down and it was possible that\nvaluations and multiples could start to contract, which could lead to a decline in Cornerstone\u2019s trading multiple and\nstock price. Centerview reviewed with the Board of Directors a framework for engagement with a select group of\nstrategic and financial partners to gauge potential interest in Cornerstone, with the goal of such process to\nunderstand potential levels of interest with modest management time investment and using market feedback as the\nbasis for fact-based decision making regarding strategic planning. The proposed framework included abbreviated\nmanagement presentations to participants focusing on industry dynamics, the opportunities available to Cornerstone\nand forward-looking financial information. The Board of Directors discussed the positive macro market environment,\nincluding the historic multiples and premiums being paid in transactions in the software sector, the risk of a possible\nmarket downturn and the resulting negative pressure that would put on valuations, and the positives and negatives\nassociated with undertaking a targeted outreach consistent with the framework previously discussed and determined\nthat, despite the risk of leaks and internal management distractions, the additional market intelligence that might be\nobtained by such outreach would benefit the Board of Directors\u2019 assessment of potential strategic alternatives,\nincluding pursuing Cornerstone\u2019s long-term standalone plan. The Board of Directors discussed with Cornerstone\nmanagement and representatives of Centerview the appropriate parties to contact in connection with such framework\nbased on an assessment of the parties most likely to be interested in a potential transaction and able to provide an\nattractive valuation and determined to focus initially on a limited number of parties to limit the risk of leaks. It was\nalso determined that the timing of such outreach should begin on an appropriate date following the announcement of\nCornerstone\u2019s first quarter earnings in May so that the contacted parties would have the benefit of the earnings\nrelease information that the Board of Directors then expected to be viewed favorably. Following the determination by\nthe Board of Directors to proceed with the proposed framework, Cornerstone management recommended to the Board\nof Directors that Qatalyst Partners be engaged, together with Centerview, to act on behalf of Cornerstone in\nconnection with such outreach based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexperience working with companies similarly situated to Cornerstone and the strength of its reputation and\nexperience, specifically in the software sector. Based on, among other things, the recommendation of certain directors\nand the familiarity of other directors with Qatalyst Partners from prior professional interactions, the Board of\nDirectors agreed and instructed Cornerstone management to work with Qatalyst Partners and Centerview to\nundertake such outreach following the announcement of earnings.\nOn May 6, 2021, Cornerstone announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2021.\nOn May 20, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent Clearlake a proposed non-disclosure agreement. On June\n2, 2021, after negotiations between the parties regarding the terms of the non-disclosure agreement, Clearlake and\nCornerstone executed a non-disclosure agreement.\nDuring the period beginning on May 18, 2021 and continuing until June 7, 2021, consistent with the discussions with\nthe Board of Directors, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview contacted seven parties (including\nClearlake, Party A, Party B and one possible strategic buyer, Party C, a portfolio company of a financial sponsor)\nregarding a potential strategic transaction. In addition, during that period, Cornerstone received unsolicited inbound\nrequests from three financial sponsors (including Vector and Party D), regarding a potential strategic transaction. Of\nthese parties (i) one party determined not to proceed in the process after initial contact and (ii) nine, including\nClearlake, Vector, Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D, executed non-disclosure agreements with Cornerstone that\nincluded a \u201cstandstill\u201d provision (but permitted parties to approach Cornerstone privately and confidentially during\nthe standstill period), a fall-away provision (upon the entry or public announcement of certain acquisition\ntransactions) and a restriction on engaging with any potential co-investor or financing source regarding a possible\ntransaction with Cornerstone without Cornerstone\u2019s approval, and participated in initial meetings with Cornerstone\nmanagement. Of the nine parties that executed non-disclosure agreements, three parties determined not to proceed in\nthe process after the management presentations and six parties, including Clearlake, Vector, Party A, Party B, Party C\nand Party D, were provided access following the management presentations to diligence information contained in a\nvirtual data room established by Cornerstone.\nAfter close of trading on June 1, 2021 (the \u201cUnaffected Date\u201d), Clearlake filed a Schedule 13D in connection with\nCornerstone\u2019s potential strategic review process, indicating beneficial ownership of approximately 8.3% of\nCornerstone\u2019s common stock.\nOn June 8, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of Cooley,\nQatalyst Partners and Centerview. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview reviewed with the Board of\nDirectors the parties included in discussions to date and noted that a majority of prospective buyers contacted had\ncompleted management presentations. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview reviewed with the Board\nof Directors (i) historical stock price performance, (ii) Cornerstone\u2019s stock price performance and trading volume\nfollowing Clearlake\u2019s filing of a Schedule 13D on June 1, 2021, including that on June 2, 2021, the closing price of\nCornerstone common stock rose approximately 6.0% and daily trading volume was approximately 2.7x higher than the\nthree month daily average trading volume prior to the Unaffected Date, (iii) Cornerstone\u2019s trading in the context of\nselected peers, the broader software market and its Long Range Plan, (iv) potential next steps, including continued\nengagement with existing parties, coupled with additional outbound calls to other potential financial and strategic\npartners for Cornerstone, and request for parties to submit initial indications of interest (including with respect to\nvalue) in late June, and (v) the benefits and risks of contacting additional parties. Taking these facts into account, the\nBoard of Directors discussed the advantages and disadvantages of engaging additional parties in discussions\nregarding a possible strategic transaction, including the additional third party valuation information that could be\nobtained and used to help guide strategic decision making and the incremental risk of leaks and management\ndistraction. Representatives of Cornerstone management then reviewed with the Board of Directors the preliminary\ndraft of the Long Range Plan including assumptions incorporated therein and, following discussion, the Board of\nDirectors directed Cornerstone management to revisit certain expense assumptions in fiscal year 2022 to ensure that\nsuch assumptions were consistent with management\u2019s current operational expectations for such fiscal year. Promptly\nfollowing the meeting, in response to the input provided by the Board of Directors, Cornerstone management revised\nthe Long Range Plan to reflect reduced operating expense assumptions for fiscal year 2022 for, among other things,\nreduced travel and consulting expenses, and the Board of Directors adopted the Long Range Plan as so revised by\nway of unanimous written consent on June 14, 2021. For a detailed discussion of the Long Range Plan, please see\nbelow under the caption \u201c-Financial Projections\u201d). The Board of Directors meeting continued in\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexecutive session, during which the Board of Directors continued to discuss the positives and negatives of\ncontinuing, and potentially expanding, the strategic review process to include additional financial and strategic\npartners for Cornerstone. The Board determined to proceed with additional outreach, and authorized Cornerstone\nmanagement to work with the financial advisors to target those parties believed most likely to be interested in and\nable to acquire Cornerstone. The Board of Directors determined to formally engage Qatalyst Partners and Centerview\nin connection with the ongoing strategic review process based on an assessment of such firms\u2019 respective\nknowledge and deal experience in the software industry and strategic review processes and directed Cornerstone\nmanagement to assist with the engagement process subject to Board of Directors\u2019 approval of final engagement\nterms. On July 1, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the terms of engagement with each of Qatalyst Partners and\nCenterview, and Cornerstone executed an engagement letter with each of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview\nformalizing the engagement of each of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview to act as financial advisor to the Board of\nDirectors in connection with a potential strategic transaction.\nDuring the period beginning on June 9, 2021 and continuing until June 22, 2021, consistent with the discussions with\nthe Board of Directors, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview discussed the potential transaction with\nan additional nine parties, including four possible strategic buyers and five possible financial sponsors. In addition,\nduring that period, Cornerstone received unsolicited inbound requests from three financial sponsors, including Party\nE and Party F, regarding a potential strategic transaction. Of these parties, (i) nine parties determined not to proceed\nin the process after initial contact (which group included the four potential strategic buyers), (ii) three parties\n(including Party E and Party F) executed non-disclosure agreements with Cornerstone that included a \u201cstandstill\u201d\nprovision (but permitted parties to approach Cornerstone privately and confidentially during the standstill period), a\nfall-away provision (upon the entry or public announcement of certain acquisition transactions) and a restriction on\nengaging with any potential co-investor or financing source regarding a possible transaction with Cornerstone\nwithout Cornerstone\u2019s approval, and participated in initial meetings with Cornerstone management, and (iii) following\nthe initial management meetings, (x) one party determined not to proceed in the process and indicated to\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview that it wanted to see future quarters of growth acceleration\nbefore considering an investment in Cornerstone, and (y) two parties, Party E and Party F, determined to proceed in\nthe process and were provided access to diligence information contained in a virtual data room established by\nCornerstone.\nOn June 22, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview sent process letters to each of the parties that\nremained active in the strategic process, including Clearlake, Vector, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D, Party E, and\nParty F, requesting that such parties submit initial indications of interest to acquire Cornerstone, including the price\nper share proposed by such party, by June 28, 2021.\nOn June 23, 2021, Party C communicated to Philip S. Saunders, Cornerstone\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, that it would\nnot be submitting an indication of interest, having previously cited concerns around the amount of additional work,\nincluding with respect to integration, that Cornerstone still had to successfully complete before Party C would\nconsider an acquisition of Cornerstone. Party C noted that its affiliated financial sponsor that had also been actively\ninvolved in Party C\u2019s assessment of the opportunity may wish to separately continue in the process and that such\nfinancial sponsor would make such determination in the coming days. Mr. Saunders then relayed this communication\nto Qatalyst Partners and Centerview.\nOn June 24, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview received a proposal to acquire Cornerstone\nfrom Party B for a range of $50.00 to $55.00 per share in cash.\nOn June 24 and June 25, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners communicated to each of the parties that had\nreceived the July 22 process letter, other than Party B that had already submitted a proposal, that they were\nparticipating in a highly competitive process and that the parties should be focused on providing a meaningful\npremium to the current stock price of Cornerstone in any indications of interest.\nOn June 25, 2021, representatives of each of Party A and the financial sponsor affiliated with Party C contacted\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners to inform Qatalyst Partners that such party would not be submitting an initial\nindication of interest. Party A noted that it was not going to participate in the process as it currently had other\npriorities and it believed there was substantial execution risk and work required to achieve Cornerstone\u2019s\ntransformation initiatives. The financial sponsor affiliated with Party C indicated that it was not going to proceed in\nthe process given concerns around execution risk with Cornerstone\u2019s long-term initiatives and that it did not believe\nits view of Cornerstone\u2019s value would be competitive.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 28, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview received initial proposals to acquire\nCornerstone from (i) Clearlake for $56.00 per share in cash, (ii) Vector for a range of $56.00 to $58.00 per share in cash,\nand (iii) Party E for $70.00 per share in cash. That same day, representatives of Party F informed representatives of\nQatalyst Partners that Party F would not be proceeding with the process as Party F did not believe its view of\nCornerstone\u2019s value would be competitive.\nOn June 29, 2021, representatives of Party D contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and indicated that Party\nD would not be proceeding in the process as Party D did not believe its view of Cornerstone\u2019s value would be\ncompetitive.\nOn June 30, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview called representatives of Party E to request\nmore information regarding Party E\u2019s $70.00 per share proposal and to inquire about potential financing sources for\nthe transaction in light of the fact that publicly available historical transaction information indicated Party E had not\npreviously led transactions of the size implied by their proposal. Party E indicated they were continuing to evaluate\npotential capital structure and sources.\nOn July 1, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners called representatives of Party B regarding Party B\u2019s proposal of\n$50.00 to $55.00 per share in cash and to inform Party B that such proposal was below other proposals provided and\nto give Party B the opportunity to increase its proposal. Party B told representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it\nwould not be raising its proposal and that Party B would not be proceeding in the process.\nOn July 7, 2021, representatives of Party E called representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview to discuss\nParty E\u2019s proposal. Party E indicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview that due to resource and\ncapacity constraints Party E was not in a position to acquire Cornerstone and withdrew its offer. However, Party E\nstated that it would be interested in participating as an equity partner for another potential acquiror should\nCornerstone proceed with a strategic transaction.\nLater that day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of Cooley,\nQatalyst Partners and Centerview. Cornerstone management reviewed with the Board of Directors management\u2019s\npreliminary estimates of certain performance metrics and trends through the end of the second quarter of 2021,\nincluding with respect to customer renewal rates, expense management, sales pipeline and employee turnover, and\nthat, while successfully executing on the annual plan for fiscal year 2021 was still possible it remained subject to\nchallenges in and outside of Cornerstone\u2019s control. Following discussion, Cooley reviewed with the Board of\nDirectors its fiduciary duties in connection with a strategic transaction process. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nand Centerview then provided an update to the Board of Directors on the status of the strategic process, including\nthat Party A, Party B, Party C, as well as the financial sponsor of Party C, Party D, Party E and Party F had determined\nnot to proceed, the reasoning provided by such parties, and the collective view by the financial advisors that Vector\ndid not currently have sufficient funds under management to effectively lead an acquisition of Cornerstone, leaving\nClearlake as the only remaining credible potential buyer. The financial advisors noted that they had conveyed to\nVector their assessment regarding its ability to lead an acquisition, and in response Vector had requested the\nopportunity to invest with a qualified buyer, should Cornerstone proceed with a strategic transaction. Following\ndiscussion, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview reviewed certain financial aspects of the proposals\nsubmitted by Clearlake, Vector, Party B and Party E and discussed the potential benefits of introducing Vector to\nClearlake, including as a way to potentially increase Clearlake\u2019s view of Cornerstone\u2019s value in light of the range\nincluded in Vector's earlier proposal. The Board of Directors discussed, among other things, the current state of the\nfinancial markets, valuations and multiples for software companies being at or near highs and the possibility of\nmarket contraction given future macro uncertainties, including the possible disruptive impact of COVID-19 and\nrelated variants (with regards to the return to work and day-to-day operations of Cornerstone and on the buying\ndecisions of its customers), a dynamic interest rate environment and/or possible tax reform. The Board of Directors\ndiscussed the execution risk around the Long Range Plan and the fact that market perceptions of the degree of\ndifficulty attendant to successfully executing on that plan may have kept other participants from staying actively\ninvolved in the strategic process and potentially has kept the price of Cornerstone\u2019s common stock from improving\ndespite the recent announcements by Cornerstone of otherwise positive trends in its business. Following discussion,\nthe Board of Directors determined to (i) disclose to Vector Clearlake\u2019s involvement in the process and permit Vector to\ncommunicate with Clearlake and (ii) permit the parties to proceed in the process so that they could complete\nconfirmatory diligence and provide an increased and more definitive proposal for the Board of Directors to\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconsider, including with respect to legal and financial terms. Representatives of Cornerstone management reviewed\nwith the Board of Directors the Internal Long Range Plan which supplemented the Long Range Plan to include non-\npublic, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 in order to provide the Board of\nDirectors with a more detailed view of valuation and discussion ensued regarding certain of the assumptions\nincorporated into such plan. The Board of Directors requested additional time to review the Internal Long Range Plan\nand determined to continue discussion regarding the Internal Long Range Plan at the next meeting of the Board of\nDirectors.\nLater that day and following the meeting of the Board of Directors, representatives of Qatalyst Partners called\nrepresentatives of Clearlake to suggest that Clearlake consider allowing Vector to participate in the proposed\ntransaction. Clearlake represented that it would consider having Vector participate as a potential minority financing\nsource in connection with a potential transaction.\nOn July 14, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of Cooley.\nRepresentatives of Cornerstone management reviewed with the Board of Directors the Internal Long Range Plan\npreviously provided at the end of the last meeting of the Board of Directors and certain of the key assumptions on\nwhich the plan was prepared. For a detailed discussion of the Internal Long Range Plan, including such assumptions,\nplease see below under the caption \u201c-Financial Projections\u201d). Discussion ensued and the Board of Directors\nadopted the Internal Long Range Plan and directed Cornerstone management to instruct each of Centerview and\nQatalyst Partners, respectively, to use the Internal Long Range Plan in connection with providing financial analyses\nin connection with the Board of Directors\u2019 evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, including the Merger.\nRepresentatives of Cornerstone management then provided an update to the Board of Directors on the status of the\nstrategic process, including that Clearlake had confirmed that Clearlake had no objection to Vector participating in\nsome of the confirmatory diligence sessions.\nIn addition, on July 14, 2021, representatives of Cornerstone management gave a presentation to representatives of\nClearlake and Vector regarding Cornerstone\u2019s business.\nOn July 15, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview, on behalf of Cornerstone, authorized Clearlake\nto initiate contact with certain identified preferred equity and debt financing sources in order to secure the necessary\nfunding to finance the proposed transaction.\nOn July 19, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview sent a process letter to Clearlake requesting\nClearlake submit its final proposal, including comments to the draft Merger Agreement to be provided in the virtual\ndata room by no later than July 26, 2021.\nLater that day, an auction draft of the Merger Agreement was provided to Clearlake via the virtual data room.\nOn July 23, 2021, a representative of a financial sponsor not involved in the process contacted Mr. Saunders, with\nwhom such representative had a personal and professional relationship for a number of years, to discuss\nCornerstone and inform Mr. Saunders that such representative had received inbound inquiries regarding\nCornerstone. The financial sponsor representative indicated a general interest in Cornerstone, but did not request\nany information regarding, or express any interest in presently pursuing, a possible strategic transaction with\nCornerstone. Given the late date of the process, that the financial sponsor expressed no current intent to actively\nengage Cornerstone regarding a possible strategic transaction and the belief of Cornerstone\u2019s management and\nfinancial advisors that the financial sponsor was undifferentiated relative to the other participants in the process, no\nfurther action was taken.\nOn July 26, 2021, Clearlake submitted a revised proposal to acquire Cornerstone for $56.50 per share in cash,\nrepresenting a 29.0% premium to the closing price per share of Cornerstone common stock on the Unaffected Date,\nthe last full trading day prior to Clearlake filing a Schedule 13D, of $43.96 per share (the \u201cUnaffected Cornerstone\nStock Price\u201d). The Clearlake proposal included a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, which proposed, among\nother things, a Company Termination Fee equal to 3.5% of the equity value of Cornerstone in certain limited\ncircumstances, including in the event Cornerstone were to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a\nsuperior offer from another party, and a Parent Termination Fee equal to 5.0% of the equity value of Cornerstone in\ncertain limited circumstances, including if Clearlake failed to close the Merger when otherwise required by the Merger\nAgreement.\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 27, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners called representatives of Clearlake to convey that Clearlake\u2019s\nrevised $56.50 per share offer was too low and that Clearlake would need to raise its offer price in order to be\nsuccessful in its bid to acquire Cornerstone.\nOn July 28, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of Cooley,\nQatalyst Partners and Centerview. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview reviewed the strategic\ntransaction process to date, including the fact that 24 parties (including five potential strategic buyers and 19\nfinancial sponsors (including Clearlake)) had been contacted, and certain financial aspects of the revised $56.50 per\nshare proposal from Clearlake. The Board of Directors discussed the current state of the financial markets, including\nthe possibility of a market correction, and the substantial execution challenges facing Cornerstone previously\nassessed in prior meetings. Additionally, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview discussed with the\nBoard of Directors the possibility that additional opportunities to initiate a strategic process in the short term would\nbe challenging given that Cornerstone would likely need to execute on its current strategic plan to garner renewed\nattention from potential financial and strategic partners. The Board of Directors meeting continued in executive\nsession, during which the Board of Directors discussed certain key areas of the business, including that near term\ncatalysts for growth were limited given that Cornerstone\u2019s current leverage ratio made it difficult for Cornerstone to\nmeaningfully participate as an active acquiror while competitors with more ready access to capital could seek to\ncapture consolidation opportunities that may make the competitive landscape more difficult for Cornerstone.\nFollowing discussion, the Board of Directors determined that the valuation reflected in Clearlake\u2019s current proposal\nwas low, but that there may be a path to completing a transaction if Clearlake were to increase its proposal and\nincrease the reverse termination fee payable by Clearlake, thereby increasing in the view of the Board of Directors the\nlevel of closing certainty. Following the meeting, a representative of the Board of Directors contacted representatives\nof Qatalyst Partners to relay the Board of Directors decision and to instruct Qatalyst Partners to convey the same to\nClearlake.\nOn July 30, 2021, Cooley provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley Austin LLP (\u201cSidley\u201d),\nClearlake\u2019s outside legal counsel, which draft proposed, among other things, a 3.0% Company Termination Fee and\n8.0% Parent Termination Fee, and an initial draft of the Miller Support Agreement, pursuant to which, among other\nthings, Mr. Miller and certain stockholders of Cornerstone affiliated with Mr. Miller would be required to vote their\nshares of common stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and against any alternative acquisition proposals and any\naction which is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or\nadversely affect the Merger. That same day, Sidley provided to Cooley initial drafts of the Equity Commitment Letter\nand Limited Guarantee and initial drafts of the Silver Lake Support Agreements pursuant to which, among other\nthings, the Silver Lake Group would be required to support certain amendments to the Indenture governing the\nCornerstone Convertible Notes to facilitate the consummation of the proposed Merger and the financing relating\nthereto.\nAlso on July 30, 2020, Qatalyst Partners informed Clearlake that the Board of Directors would not transact at\nClearlake\u2019s current proposal.\nOn July 31, 2021, Sidley provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Cooley, which draft proposed, among\nother things, a 3.5% Company Termination Fee and 6.0% Parent Termination Fee. That same day, Sidley sent to\nCooley initial drafts of the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter.\nOn August 2, 2021, Clearlake submitted a revised proposal to acquire Cornerstone for $57.00 per share in cash,\nrepresenting a 30.0% premium to the Unaffected Cornerstone Stock Price. Clearlake\u2019s revised proposal included\nexecuted debt financing commitments representing the proposed debt financing for the transaction as well as\nexecuted equity financing commitments representing the proposed equity financing for the transaction.\nLater that same day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of\nCooley, Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview provided an update\non the status of discussions with Clearlake, including the revised proposal of $57.00 per share, and reviewed with the\nBoard of Directors certain aspects of the proposed equity and debt financing package submitted by Clearlake,\nincluding the sources and uses provided by Clearlake. The Board of Directors\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmeeting continued in executive session, during which the Board of Directors further discussed Clearlake\u2019s revised\nproposal and possible responses. Following discussion, the Board of Directors determined to continue to negotiate\nprice and instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview to seek a higher price from Clearlake.\nLater that same day, Cooley provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley, which draft proposed,\namong other things, a 3.0% Company Termination Fee and 7.5% Parent Termination Fee.\nOn August 3, 2021, Qatalyst Partners called representatives of Clearlake to discuss the status of the proposed\ntransaction and conveyed that there was a path for Cornerstone to transact at $58.00 per share with a 3.25%\nCompany Termination Fee and a 7.0% Parent Termination Fee. Clearlake stated that it could not support a bid at\n$58.00 per share and responded with a revised proposal to acquire Cornerstone for $57.50 per share in cash,\nrepresenting a 31.0% premium to the Unaffected Cornerstone Stock Price, indicating that it would not raise its price\nany further.\nLater that same day, Sidley provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Cooley, which draft proposed,\namong other things, a 3.5% Company Termination Fee and 6.0% Parent Termination Fee, and an initial draft of the\nClearlake Support Agreement with the Clearlake Stockholder pursuant to which, among other things, the Clearlake\nStockholder would be required to vote its shares of common stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\nand the approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and against any\nalternative acquisition proposals and any action which is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to impede,\ninterfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Merger.\nLater that same day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of\nCooley, Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. Representatives of Cornerstone management reviewed with the Board of\nDirectors certain adjustments proposed by Cornerstone management to fiscal year 2021 of the Internal Long Range\nPlan, including to reflect actual results through the end of the second quarter and the estimated cost reductions for\n2021. It was noted that because of the one-time nature of the cost reductions, they did not impact any fiscal year in\nthe Internal Long Range Plan other than 2021. Following discussion, the Board of Directors directed Cornerstone\nmanagement to revise the Internal Long Range Plan to reflect such adjustments and to provide such adjustments to\nClearlake. For a detailed discussion of the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan, including such adjustments, please\nsee below under the caption \u201c-Financial Projections\u201d. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview\nprovided an update on the status of discussions with Clearlake including the revised proposal of $57.50 per share\nprovided by Clearlake and its statement that it would not increase price any further. Representatives of Cooley\ndescribed certain material terms and proposed changes to the draft Merger Agreement, including (a) the increase of\nthe Company Termination Fee from 3.0% to 3.5% of equity value and the decrease of the Parent Termination Fee from\n7.5% to 6.0% of equity value, and (b) the requirement that the marketing period for Parent\u2019s debt financing not begin\nuntil US HSR Act and stockholder approval had been obtained. The Board of Directors meeting continued in\nexecutive session, during which the Board of Directors further discussed Clearlake\u2019s $57.50 per share proposal.\nRepresentatives of Cooley then described the preliminary calculations that had been conducted in connection with\nthe excise tax potentially payable by certain members of Cornerstone management as a result of the anticipated\ntransaction under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999 and the concept of gross-up payments for any related taxes\npayable with respect to the payments of such excise taxes (such arrangements, \u201c280G gross-up arrangements\u201d). After\ndiscussion and review of the preliminary excise tax and gross-up estimates, including that Clearlake would likely not\nagree to any proposal that did not limit the potential liability associated with 280G gross-up arrangements, the Board\nof Directors determined to provide 280G gross-up arrangements for affected members of Cornerstone management\nsubject to a $7,000,000 aggregate cap. After discussion, the Board of Directors concluded that, in light of all the\nfactors and risks associated with Cornerstone\u2019s standalone plan, concerns regarding the risk of losing Clearlake\u2019s\nfinal offer of $57.50 per share if Cornerstone continued to pursue a higher price, the unlikeness of there being another\nacquiror willing to pay a higher price to acquire Cornerstone given the broad nature of the strategic process\nconducted and the fact the Clearlake\u2019s proposal enabled Cornerstone stockholders to realize an immediate, certain\nand significant premium for their stock without the execution and other risks associated with Cornerstone\u2019s\nstandalone plan, it would agree to move forward on the basis of the $57.50 per share proposal provided that Clearlake\nagree to (i) the marketing period beginning after Labor Day and (ii) a\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n3.25% Company Termination Fee and 7.0% Parent Termination Fee. In addition, the Board determined it would seek\nfrom Clearlake the proposed 280G gross-up arrangements subject to a $7,000,000 aggregate cap. Following the\nmeeting, the Board of Directors directed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to relay the Board of Directors\u2019 decision\nto Clearlake.\nLater that same day, at the direction of the Board of Directors, a representative of Qatalyst Partners called a\nrepresentative of Clearlake to express the Board of Directors\u2019 willingness to proceed on the basis of the last offer\nproposed by Clearlake of $57.50 per share in cash if Clearlake agreed to the terms outlined by the Board of Directors.\nShortly thereafter, Cooley sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley reflecting the terms outlined by the\nBoard of Directors.\nOn August 4, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of\nCooley, Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. Representatives of Cornerstone management provided an update to the\nBoard of Directors regarding the current transaction status and noted that the terms of the Silver Lake Support\nAgreements had not yet been finalized. Following the update from Cornerstone management, representatives of\nQatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board of Directors Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses of Clearlake\u2019s $57.50 per\nshare proposal and then representatives of Centerview reviewed with the Board of Directors Centerview\u2019s financial\nanalyses of Clearlake\u2019s $57.50 per share proposal. Following the presentations by Qatalyst Partners and Centerview,\nCooley reviewed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties applicable in connection with the strategic\ntransaction process and the proposed Merger, and reviewed certain material terms of the draft Merger Agreement and\nrelated transactions, including (a) that the marketing period for Parent\u2019s debt financing would begin on the earlier of\nSeptember 8, 2021 and the first date following the filing of the definitive proxy, which date was anticipated to roughly\ncoincide with September 8, 2021 absent SEC review of the preliminary proxy, (b) that Clearlake had agreed to the\n3.25% Company Termination Fee and 7.0% Parent Termination Fee, (c) the conditions to the consummation of the\nMerger, (d) that Mr. Miller (together with certain stockholders affiliated with Mr. Miller), the Clearlake Stockholder\nand the Silver Lake Group would be entering into certain support agreements concurrently with the execution of the\nMerger Agreement, and (e) that Clearlake had agreed to the proposed 280G gross-up arrangements subject to the\n$7,000,000 aggregate cap proposed by Cornerstone. Cooley noted to the Board of Directors that Clearlake indicated it\nhad not included in a Support Agreement from Vector its latest proposal because it was unclear whether Vector would\nultimately be included as a minority investor in the proposed transaction. The Board of Directors then adjourned the\nmeeting and determined to reconvene the meeting after the terms and conditions to the Silver Lake Support\nAgreements were finalized as among the parties.\nThroughout the remainder of August 4 and 5, 2021, the parties worked to finalize the Merger Agreement and the\nsupport agreements, including a support agreement from Vector (which would be entered into in connection with\nClearlake agreeing that Vector could make a minority investment in Parent at the closing of the Merger). The parties\nalso worked to finalize the Debt Commitment Letters, the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment\nLetter and the Limited Guarantee.\nOn the afternoon of August 5, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and\nrepresentatives of Cooley, Qatalyst Partners and Centerview to review the final Clearlake $57.50 per share proposal.\nRepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners confirmed to the Board of Directors that there were no material changes to the\nfinancial analysis presented to the Board of Directors by Qatalyst Partners at the meeting of the Board of Directors\nthe day prior and delivered to the Board of Directors the oral opinion of Qatalyst Partners, which was subsequently\nconfirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 5, 2021, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and\nsubject to various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in its written opinion, the $57.50\nper share in cash to be received by the holders of shares of common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate thereof)\npursuant to, and in accordance with, the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders,\nas more fully described below in the section entitled \u201c-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP.\u201d Representatives of\nCenterview then confirmed to the Board of Directors that there were no material changes to the financial analysis\npresented by Centerview to the Board of Directors at the meeting of the Board of Directors from the day prior and\ndelivered to the Board of Directors the oral opinion of Centerview, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of\na written opinion dated such date that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the\n$57.50 per share in cash to be paid to the holders of shares of common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant\nto, and in accordance with, the Merger\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAgreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Centerview\u2019s opinion,\nplease see below under the caption \u201c-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC\u201d). Following the presentations by\nQatalyst Partners and Centerview, Cooley reviewed with the Board of Directors the material terms of the draft Merger\nAgreement and related transactions, including the related transaction documents. The Board of Directors then\ndiscussed the potential transaction with Clearlake, and, after carefully considering the matters discussed during that\nmeeting and prior meetings of the Board of Directors (for more information, see the section titled \u201c -Reasons for the\nMerger\u201d), the Board of Directors unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Voting and Support\nAgreements and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger (the\n\u201cTransactions\u201d), are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Cornerstone and its stockholders\u037e (ii) agreed\nthat the Merger shall be governed and effected in accordance with the DGCL\u037e (iii) declared it advisable to enter into\nthe Merger Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreements and to consummate the Transactions, (iv) authorized and\napproved the execution, delivery and performance by Cornerstone of the Merger Agreement, and the consummation\nof the Transactions\u037e and (v) subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, resolved to recommend\nthat the Cornerstone stockholders, on behalf of Cornerstone, to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the\nMerger and the transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the DGCL.\nLater that day, the parties executed the Merger Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreements, the Equity\nCommitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter,\nand Cornerstone and Clearlake issued a joint press release announcing the transaction, including that Vector had\nagreed to make a minority investment in Parent at the Closing of the Merger (which was subsequently disclosed in an\namended Schedule 13D filed by Clearlake to consist of a contribution of shares of common stock of Cornerstone and\ncash for an aggregate value of approximately $100 million).\nOn August 9, 2021, Party E contacted Cornerstone to request, and received, permission under the terms of Party E\u2019s\nnon-disclosure agreement with Cornerstone to engage with Clearlake regarding a potential equity co-investment in\nParent.\nOn August 19, 2021, each of Cornerstone and Parent filed its Premerger Notification and Report Form with the FTC\nand the Antitrust Division for review in connection with the Merger.\nRecommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger",

            "text": "Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors has unanimously: (i) determined the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Cornerstone\nand its stockholders\u037e (ii) agreed that the Merger shall be governed and effected in accordance with the DGCL\u037e (iii)\ndeclared it advisable to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, including the Merger\u037e (iv) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by\nCornerstone of the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e and (v) subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, resolved to\nrecommend that, on behalf of Cornerstone, the Cornerstone stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve\nthe Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the DGCL.\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends, on behalf of Cornerstone, that you vote: (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal\u037e\nand (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn the course of reaching its determination and recommendation, the Board of Directors consulted with Cornerstone\nmanagement, Cooley and its financial advisors, Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. The Board of Directors considered\nthe following reasons (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which it viewed as generally\nsupporting its (i) determination that the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, the Voting and Support Agreements and the Transactions, are advisable and fair to, and in the best\ninterest of, Cornerstone and its stockholders, (ii) authorization and approval of the execution, delivery and\nperformance by Cornerstone of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the\n35TABLE OF CONTENTS\nTransactions, including the Merger and (iii) subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,\nrecommendation that Cornerstone stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the\nTransactions.\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration of $57.50 per share represented a compelling premium to historical\nmarket prices for the shares of Cornerstone common stock, including that the Merger Consideration\nconstituted a premium of:\n\u2022\napproximately 31% to the closing price of Cornerstone\u2019s common stock of $43.96 on June 1, 2021, the\nlast full trading day prior to Clearlake filing a Schedule 13D in connection with Cornerstone\u2019s potential\nstrategic review process\u037e and\n\u2022\napproximately 40% to Cornerstone\u2019s last twelve months volume weighted average price for the period\nending on June 1, 2021, the last full trading day prior to Clearlake filing a Schedule 13D in connection\nwith Cornerstone\u2019s potential strategic review process\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that, during the course of negotiations with Clearlake (as more fully described below under the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Background of the Merger\u201d), Clearlake increased its\ninitial offer from $56.00 per share on June 30, 2021, to $56.50 per share on July 26, 2021, to $57.00 per share\non August 2, 2021, and then, ultimately, to $57.50 per share on August 3, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that, (i) as a result of an active negotiating process, including specific instruction from Clearlake,\nCornerstone had obtained Clearlake\u2019s best and final offer, and (ii) there was substantial risk of losing\nClearlake\u2019s final offer of $57.50 per share if Cornerstone continued to pursue a higher price, the Merger\nConsideration represented the highest price that Clearlake was willing to pay and the highest price per\nshare value reasonably obtainable under the circumstances as of the date of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe strategic transaction process conducted by Cornerstone, including the fact that 24 different parties,\nincluding potential strategic and financial partners (including Clearlake), were contacted or solicited during\nthe process in an effort to obtain the best value reasonably available to Cornerstone stockholders, and that\nno such party was willing to move forward with Cornerstone regarding a potential transaction on terms that\nwere better than the Clearlake proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the consideration to be paid in the Merger is payable solely in cash, which allows Cornerstone\nstockholders to realize immediate liquidity and certainty of value in respect of their shares of Cornerstone\ncommon stock, while eliminating the effect on stockholders of long-term business and execution risk, as\nwell as risks related to the financial markets generally (including the ongoing risks and uncertainties around\nCOVID-19 and related variants on return to work and day-to-day operations of Cornerstone, on\nCornerstone\u2019s customers (including with respect to buying decisions and potentially extended sales\ncycles) and on the broader financial markets)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to Cornerstone stockholders than the potential\nvalue that would reasonably be expected to result from other strategic and financial alternatives reasonably\navailable, which could include: (i) the continuation of Cornerstone\u2019s business plan as an independent\nenterprise, as assessed based on its historical results of operations, financial prospects and condition\u037e (ii)\nmodifications to Cornerstone\u2019s business and operations strategy\u037e and (iii) potential expansion\nopportunities, including into new business lines, through acquisitions and combinations of Cornerstone\nwith other businesses\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the aforementioned other strategic and financial alternatives were not reasonably likely to\ncreate greater value for Cornerstone\u2019s stockholders than the Merger, taking into account, among other\nvariables, (i) execution risks as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks, particularly those\nin the subscription software and talent management industries more generally, (ii) risks resulting from\nCornerstone\u2019s inability at present to meaningfully participate as an active acquirer as a result of its current\nleverage ratio while competitors with more available access to capital may foreclose future opportunities for\ngrowth by acquisition, (iii) risks associated with completing the successful integration of Saba Software,\nInc. and the other related acquired entities (\u201cSaba\u201d), (iv) risks that Cornerstone may not be able to increase\nrevenues in line with market expectations and/or internal projections, (v) risks involved with future\nemployee retention, (vi) risks around whether the public market will appropriately\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nvalue Cornerstone\u2019s ongoing execution progress of its business plan,(vii) risks associated with\nCornerstone achieving internal revenue projections, which are highly dependent on the launch of new\nproducts, (including risks and uncertainties regarding efforts to drive customer adoption of Cornerstone\u2019s\nnew platform and content offerings), (viii) the fact that Cornerstone\u2019s research analyst coverage and\ntrading volumes had diminished over time and the risk that these factors could adversely impact future\nstock performance, and (ix) risks associated with a decline in market trading multiples over time, which\ncould lead to a decline in Cornerstone\u2019s trading multiple and stock price\u037e\n\u2022\nthe high degree of certainty that the closing would be achieved in a timely manner, under the terms of the\nMerger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthat (i) the Signing Stockholders that held, in the aggregate, approximately 15.65% of the voting power of\nthe outstanding shares of Cornerstone common stock as of July 30, 2021, entered into the Voting and\nSupport Agreements obligating each of them during the term of such agreement (A) subject to certain\nlimited exceptions, not to transfer any shares of Cornerstone common stock owned by them and (B) to vote\nall their shares of Cornerstone common stock (1) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the\napproval of the Merger and the other Transactions and/or (2) against any acquisition proposal or any\naction or agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to\nCornerstone\u2019s obligations to consummate the Merger as specified in the Merger Agreement not being\nfulfilled or any alternative acquisition proposals, and (ii) the Silver Lake Group entered into the Silver Lake\nSupport Agreements, which requires the Silver Lake Group (A) subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer\nor convert into common stock their Cornerstone Convertible Notes and (B) to support certain amendments\nto the Indenture to facilitate the consummation of the Merger and the financing relating thereto\u037e\n\u2022\nthe oral opinion of Qatalyst Partners, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 5,\n2021, and subject to the various limitations, qualifications, assumptions and other conditions set forth in\nsuch written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cornerstone\ncommon stock (other than Parent or an affiliate of Parent), pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Merger\nAgreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below under the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP,\u201d which full text of\nthe written opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this\nproxy statement in its entirety\u037e\n\u2022\nthe oral opinion of Centerview, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 5, 2021,\nand based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and\nqualifications and limitations set forth in such written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the\nholders of shares of Cornerstone common stock (other than Excluded Shares (as defined in its opinion,\nwhich include, for example, shares of common stock owned by stockholders who have properly and validly\nexercised their statutory rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL), pursuant to, and in accordance\nwith, the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described\nbelow under the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Opinion of Centerview Partners\nLLC,\u201d which full text of the written opinion is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is\nincorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety\u037e\n\u2022\nthe terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements, including:\n\u2022\nthe conditions to the consummation of the Merger being specific and limited, including the\nrequirement that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the holders of at least a majority of the\noutstanding shares of Cornerstone common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nCornerstone\u2019s right, subject to certain conditions, to respond to and negotiate unsolicited acquisition\nproposals that are made on or after August 5, 2021 and prior to the time that the Merger Agreement,\nthe Merger and the Transactions are approved by Cornerstone\u2019s stockholders, as more fully described\nin the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-The\nBoard of Directors\u2019 Recommendation\u037e Company Adverse Change Recommendation\u201d\u037e\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe fact that Parent and Merger Sub have obtained committed debt and preferred equity financing for\nthe transaction from reputable financial institutions and from certain affiliated funds of Parent and\ncommitted equity financing from certain affiliated funds of Parent that together provide funding of an\namount sufficient to cover the aggregate Merger Consideration, all fees and expenses payable by\nParent, Merger Sub or Cornerstone on the date on which the Closing occurs (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d) and\nthe repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness required to be repaid or refinanced on the Closing\nDate\u037e\n\u2022\nthe obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Financing\nand the limited number and nature of the conditions to the Financing\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of the parties to consummate the Merger, including the absence of any financing condition\nin the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nCornerstone\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the Equity\nCommitment Letter, to seek specific performance of Parent\u2019s obligation to cause the equity\ncommitment to be funded\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Agreement provides that Parent will pay Cornerstone a termination fee in the\namount of $320,000,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Cornerstone due to any breach of\nrepresentations or covenants made by Parent or Merger Sub that causes a closing condition not to be\nsatisfied (following notice and an opportunity to cure) or in certain circumstances in which all other\nclosing conditions have been satisfied, but Parent or Merger Sub fails to close when required to do so\nunder the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Guarantors provided a limited guaranty in favor of Cornerstone, which, taken\ntogether, guarantee the obligation of Parent to pay any termination fee, reimburse and indemnify\nCornerstone with respect to certain expenses in connection with its cooperation with obtaining\nParent\u2019s debt financing and pay certain other amounts required under the Merger Agreement, subject\nto an aggregate cap equal to $322,000,000 (as more fully described below under the section of this\nproxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Financing of the\nMerger\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nCornerstone\u2019s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Offer, subject to\ncertain conditions of the Merger Agreement and paying Parent a termination fee of $150,000,000\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Board of Directors believed that the Cornerstone termination fee of $150,000,000 is\nreasonable, is consistent with market averages for such fees payable in comparable transactions, and\nis not preclusive of, or a substantial impediment to, a third party making an Acquisition Proposal (as\nmore fully described under the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the\nMerger Agreement-The Board of Directors\u2019 Recommendation\u037e Company Adverse Change\nRecommendation\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nCornerstone\u2019s entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe end date of February 5, 2022, allowing for time that the Board of Directors believes to be sufficient\nto complete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe availability of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to Cornerstone\u2019s stockholders who\ndo not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required\nprocedures under Delaware law, which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to\nhave a Delaware court determine the fair value of their shares, which may be more than, less than, or\nthe same as the amount such stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe likelihood of satisfying the conditions to complete the Merger and the likelihood that the Merger\nwill be completed.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the\nfollowing (which are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):\n\u2022\nthe fact that Cornerstone would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and\nstockholders would no longer participate in any future earnings or growth and would not benefit from any\npotential future appreciation in value of Cornerstone\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and costs to Cornerstone if the Merger does not close or is not completed in a timely manner,\nincluding the diversion of management and employee attention, and the potential effect on Cornerstone\u2019s\nbusiness and relationships with customers, partners and employees, any or all of which risks and costs,\namong other things, could adversely affect Cornerstone\u2019s overall competitive position and the trading price\nof Cornerstone\u2019s common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nthe requirement that Cornerstone pay Parent a termination fee of $150,000,000 under certain circumstances\nfollowing termination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Board of Directors terminates the Merger\nAgreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Offer (as more fully described\nunder the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-The\nBoard of Directors\u2019 Recommendation\u037e Company Adverse Change Recommendation\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nif Parent fails to complete the Merger as a result of failure to obtain the Debt Financing or as a breach of the\nMerger Agreement in certain circumstances, remedies may be limited to the termination fee payable by\nParent described above, which may be inadequate to compensate Cornerstone for the damage caused, and\nif available, other rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce, and the success of any\nsuch action may be uncertain\u037e\n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of Cornerstone\u2019s business prior to the consummation of the Merger,\nincluding the requirement that Cornerstone conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to specific\nlimitations, which may delay or prevent Cornerstone from undertaking business opportunities that may\narise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger Agreement, Cornerstone might have\npursued\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that an all cash transaction would generally be taxable to Cornerstone\u2019s stockholders that are U.S.\npersons for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement prohibits Cornerstone and its representatives from\nsoliciting third party acquisition proposals until the earlier of the filing of the certificate of merger and the\ntermination of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the\nMerger (many of which are payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time\nand effort of Cornerstone management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt its business\noperations and have a negative effect on its financial results\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of\ntermination of the Merger Agreement on the trading price of Cornerstone\u2019s common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the completion of the Merger will require certain antitrust clearance and consents, which\nclearances and consents could subject the Merger to unforeseen delays and risks\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Cornerstone\u2019s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different\nfrom, or in addition to, those of Cornerstone\u2019s stockholders (see below under the caption \u201c-Interests of\nCornerstone\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of key management or other personnel of Cornerstone during the pendency of the\nMerger.\nThe foregoing discussion of reasons for the recommendation to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the\nMerger and the transactions contemplated thereby addresses the reasons considered by Cornerstone\u2019s Board of\nDirectors in consideration of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of reasons considered by the Board of\nDirectors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board of Directors\ndid not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nspecific reasons considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in considering the information\nand reasons described above, individual members of the Board of Directors each applied his or her own personal\nbusiness judgment to the process and may have given differing weights to differing factors. The Board of Directors\nbased its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented. The explanation of the reasons\nand reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nFinancial Projections\nWhile Cornerstone has publicly issued limited short-term guidance concerning aspects of its expected financial\nperformance from time to time, Cornerstone does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal\nprojections as to future performance or results of operations due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying\nassumptions and projections. However, in connection with the review of potential strategic alternatives, including\nCornerstone\u2019s evaluation of the Merger, Cornerstone\u2019s management, at the direction of the Board of Directors,\nprepared certain unaudited, long-range financial projections (collectively, as described and defined in more detail\nbelow, the \u201cProjections\u201d). Cornerstone management provided the Projections to the Board of Directors, and at the\ndirection of the Board of Directors, to Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. The Board of Directors directed each of\nQatalyst Partners and Centerview, respectively, to use the Projections as they existed at the applicable time in\nconnection with providing financial analyses in connection with the evaluation by the Board of Directors of potential\nstrategic alternatives, including the Merger.\nIn June 2021, management prepared non-public, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2021\nthrough 2024 (the \u201cLong Range Plan\u201d), and the Long Range Plan was discussed with, and approved for use by, the\nBoard of Directors in connection with the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, including the Merger. The\nLong Range Plan was provided to Qatalyst Partners and Centerview as well as Clearlake and other potential acquirers\nin late-June 2021. In July 2021, management supplemented the Long Range Plan to include non-public, unaudited\nprospective financial information for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 (the \u201cInternal Long Range Plan\u201d), and provided the\nInternal Long Range Plan to the Board of Directors and to Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. The Internal Long\nRange Plan was not provided to any potential acquirers.\nLater in July 2021, management made adjustments to the unaudited forecasts for fiscal year 2021 (such revisions, the\n\u201cLong Range Plan Adjustments\u201d) to, among other things, reflect actual results through the second quarter of 2021\nand reduced cost estimates for the second half of fiscal year 2021 due, in part, to lighter than expected travel and\nentertainment expenses, delays in relation to certain hiring objectives and reductions to discretionary expense\nreserves in the annual budget, and at the direction of the Board of Directors, provided the Long Range Plan\nAdjustments to Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. As compared to the Long Range Plan, the Long Range Plan\nAdjustments reflected an increase in total revenue for fiscal year 2021 from to $855 million to $859 million, an increase\nin adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) from $276 million to $304\nmillion, an increase in non-GAAP operating income from $226 million to $255 million, an increase in levered free cash\nflow from $173 million to $185 million and an increase in unlevered free cash flow from $221 million to $235 million.\nBecause of the one-time nature of the cost reductions included in the Long Range Plan Adjustments, and such\nreductions did not impact any fiscal year other than 2021. The Long Range Plan Adjustments (except for adjusted\nEBITDA and levered free cash flow, separate line items for which were not included in the Long Range Plan\npreviously shared with Clearlake) were shared with Clearlake on August 3, 2021 in connection with Clearlake\u2019s due\ndiligence review. The Internal Long Range Plan was revised to reflect the Long Range Plan Adjustments (as so\nrevised, the \u201cAdjusted Internal Long Range Plan\u201d), and at the direction of the Board of Directors, provided to\nQatalyst Partners and Centerview for purposes of rendering their respective fairness opinions to the Board of\nDirectors and related financial analyses.\nThe Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with GAAP, nor were\nthey prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established\nby the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of projections of\nprospective financial information. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the Projections were relied upon by the\nBoard of Directors in connection with its consideration of the Merger and the Merger Consideration. While\nCornerstone believes that such non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information in analyzing\nCornerstone\u2019s financial results, there are limitations associated with the use of such financial measures. Such non-\nGAAP measures as used by Cornerstone may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other\ncompanies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsubstitute for, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. The SEC rules, which otherwise would\nrequire a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure, do not apply to non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provided to a board of directors or financial advisors in connection with a proposed business\ncombination transaction such as the proposed Transactions if the disclosure is included in a document such as this\nproxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to a GAAP financial measure were not\nprovided to or relied upon by the Board of Directors or Cornerstone\u2019s financial advisors in connection with the\nMerger. Accordingly, Cornerstone has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the\nProjections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. The Projections may differ from published analyst estimates\nand forecasts, and do not take into account any events or circumstances after the date they were prepared, including\nthe announcement of the Transactions.\nThe Projections reflect estimates and assumptions made by Cornerstone management with respect to general\nbusiness, economic, competitive, regulatory and other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of\nwhich are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Cornerstone\u2019s control. In particular, the Projections, while\npresented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions (as described\nbelow) that are inherently uncertain. Because the Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become\nsubject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each circumstance that will\nhave an effect on Cornerstone\u2019s business and its results of operations. None of Cornerstone, Parent or any of their\nrespective affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any representation to any stockholder regarding the\nvalidity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the Projections or the ultimate performance of Cornerstone\nrelative to the financial projections. The inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an\nadmission or representation of Cornerstone that the Projections or the information contained therein is material.\nExcept as required by applicable law, neither Cornerstone nor any of its affiliates intends to, and each of them\ndisclaims any obligation to, update, correct or otherwise revise the Projections if any or all of them have changed or\nchange or otherwise have become, are or become inappropriate (even in the short term). These considerations should\nbe taken into account if evaluating the Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.\nThe Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other\ninformation regarding Cornerstone in its public filings with the SEC. The Projections were developed by Cornerstone\nmanagement on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement, and therefore the Projections do not give effect to the proposed Transactions or any changes\nto Cornerstone\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Merger, including\nany costs incurred in connection with the proposed Transactions. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into\naccount the effect of any failure of the proposed Transactions to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate\nor continuing in that context.\nThe Projections further reflect subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple\ninterpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The inclusion of the\nProjections should not be regarded as an indication that Cornerstone or anyone who received the Projections then\nconsidered, or now considers, the Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this\ninformation should not be relied upon as such. Cornerstone management views the Projections as being subject to\ninherent risks and uncertainties associated with such long-range projections.\nAdjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, levered free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow contained in\nthe Projections set forth below are each \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures,\u201d which are financial performance measures\nthat are not calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past\nand current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Cornerstone with senior management of\nCornerstone. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Cornerstone\ncommon stock and compared the financial performance of Cornerstone and the prices and trading activity of\nCornerstone common stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities.

The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any\nportion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion. For purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners\nutilized both the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan and the consensus of third-party research analysts\u2019 projections\nas of August 4, 2021 (\u201cAnalyst Projections\u201d). Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the\nfinancial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary.\nConsidering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,\nincluding the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view\nof Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of\npotential per-share present values for Cornerstone common stock as of June 30, 2021 (which is the end of\nCornerstone\u2019s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet date) by:\n\u2022\nadding:\n(i)\nthe implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of Cornerstone, based\non the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan, for the third quarter of calendar year 2021 through calendar\nyear 2025 (which implied present value was calculated by using a range of discount rates of 8.0% to\n12.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for Cornerstone)\u037e and\n(ii)\nthe implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Cornerstone, calculated by\nmultiplying the estimated unlevered free cash flow in calendar year 2026 of approximately $381 million\nbased on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan (noting that such number was based on a long-term\ncash tax rate of 20.0%, as provided by Cornerstone management), by a range of multiples of fully\ndiluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated unlevered free cash flow of 14.0x to 23.0x\n(which were chosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment) and discounted to present\nvalue using the same range of discount rates used in item (i) above\u037e and\n(iii) Cornerstone\u2019s cash and cash equivalents of $149 million as of June 30, 2021, as provided by\nCornerstone management\u037e\n\u2022\nsubtracting the $300 million face value of Cornerstone\u2019s outstanding convertible debt and the $828 million\nprincipal amount of Cornerstone\u2019s outstanding term loan, each as of June 30, 2021, as provided by\nCornerstone management\u037e and\n\u2022\ndividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Cornerstone common stock\n(calculated utilizing the treasury stock method), which takes into account restricted stock units,\nperformance-based restricted stock units and in-the-money stock options as of July 30, 2021 and inclusive\nof a subsequent August 2, 2021 RSU grant, all of which amounts were provided by Cornerstone\u2019s\nmanagement, and assuming net share settlement of in-the-money convertible debt, with each of the above-\nreferenced estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value having also been adjusted for the\ndegree of estimated dilution to current stockholders through each respective applicable period (0.25%\ncombined in the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2021 and approximately 3% annually through\ncalendar year 2025) due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations related to future\nequity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Cornerstone management.\nBased on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Cornerstone common\nstock of approximately $41.63 to $76.14.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Companies Analysis\nQatalyst Partners compared selected financial information and public market multiples for Cornerstone with publicly\navailable information and public market multiples for selected companies, which were selected by Qatalyst Partners in\nits professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of\nbusiness to Cornerstone, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have other relevant or\nsimilar characteristics.

Based on the fully diluted shares of Cornerstone common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury\nstock method), which takes into account restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and in-the-\nmoney stock options as of July 30, 2021 and inclusive of a subsequent August 2, 2021 RSU grant, all of which\namounts were provided by Cornerstone\u2019s management, and assuming net share settlement of in-the-money\nconvertible debt, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Cornerstone common stock of approximately\n$37.13 to $60.41 based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan and approximately $37.87 to $61.40 based on the\nAnalyst Projections.\nBased upon the Analyst Projections as of August 4, 2021, for calendar year 2022, and using the closing prices as of\nAugust 4, 2021, for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the implied\nfully diluted equity value divided by the estimated consensus levered free cash flow for calendar year 2022 (the\n\u201cCY2022E LFCF Multiples\u201d) for each of the selected companies.\nThe CY2022E LFCF Multiple for Cornerstone was 13.2x based on the Analyst Projections, and the fully diluted equity\nvalue of Cornerstone was calculated using the closing price of Cornerstone common stock as of the Unaffected Date.\nBased on the analysis of the CY2022E LFCF Multiples for each of the selected companies and the application of its\nprofessional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of 12.0x to 20.0x and applied this range to\nCornerstone\u2019s estimated calendar year 2022 levered free cash flow based on each of the Adjusted Internal Long\nRange Plan and the Analyst Projections. Based on the same fully diluted share count calculation as used for the\nanalysis utilizing CY2022E Revenue Multiples above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for\nCornerstone common stock of approximately $45.16 to $72.32 based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan and\napproximately $40.15 to $64.33 based on the Analyst Projections.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNo company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Cornerstone. In evaluating the selected\ncompanies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control\nof Cornerstone, such as the impact of competition on Cornerstone\u2019s business and the industry in general, industry\ngrowth and the absence of any material adverse change in Cornerstone\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the\nindustry or in the financial markets in general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the\narithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nQatalyst Partners compared 19 selected public software transactions announced since 2010 that had a deal value of\n$1 billion to $15 billion and targets with less than 15% growth and greater than 14% levered free cash flow margin.\nThese transactions are listed below:\nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nNTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nNTM\nEBITDA\nMultiple\nNTM \nLFCF\nMultiple\n04/26/21\nProofpoint, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n9.4x\n-\n-\n12/21/20\nRealPage\nThoma Bravo\n8.2x\n28.9x\n37.8x\n05/22/12\nAriba, Inc.\nSAP SE\n7.8x\n32.4x\n48.9x\n06/01/21\nCloudera, Inc.\nKKR and Clayton, Dubilier &\nRice\n5.2x\n30.4x\n41.9x\n09/13/15\nSolera Holdings, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners\n5.2x\n13.4x\n20.4x\n10/10/18\nImperva, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n5.1x\n45.1x\n32.2x\n05/12/10\nSybase, Inc.\nSAP SE\n4.5x\n12.9x\n18.9x\n04/07/15\nInformatica Corporation\nPermira Advisers and Canada\nPension Plan Investment\nBoard\n4.3x\n18.1x\n22.1x\n09/19/16\nInfoblox Inc.\nVista Equity Partners\n3.7x\n19.4x\n21.9x\n11/27/17\nBarracuda Networks, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n3.6x\n18.8x\n21.5x\n11/25/14\nAdvanced Computer\nSoftware Group Ltd.\nVista Equity Partners\n3.5x\n14.9x\n19.2x\n12/17/19\nLogMeIn, Inc.\nFrancisco Partners\n3.4x\n10.7x\n14.0x\n11/20/16\nLifeLock Inc.\nSymantec Corporation\n3.3x\n24.0x\n20.0x\n07/07/16\nAVG Technologies\nAvast Software\n3.2x\n9.0x\n13.2x\n12/15/14\nRiverbed Technology, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n3.2x\n11.5x\n15.5x\n05/06/13\nBMC Software, Inc.\nBain Capital, Golden Gate\nCapital, GIC and Institutional\nVenture Partners\n3.1x\n7.9x\n10.6x\n07/02/12\nQuest Software\nDell\n2.5x\n10.9x\n12.8x\n11/01/12\nJDA Software, Inc.\nRedPrairie (New Mountain\nCapital)\n2.5x\n9.4x\n17.6x\n04/26/11\nLawson Software\nInfor (Golden Gate Capital)\n2.4x\n10.8x\n14.3x\nNote: \u201c-\u201d means not publicly available or not meaningful.

Based on the number of fully diluted shares of Cornerstone common\nstock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock method), which takes into account restricted stock units, performance-\nbased restricted stock units and in-the-money stock options as of July 30, 2021, and inclusive of a subsequent\nAugust 2, 2021 RSU grant, all of which amounts were provided by Cornerstone\u2019s management, and excluding shares\nunderlying in-the-money convertible debt due to assuming cash settlement, including (if applicable) the value of any\nadditional make-whole shares based on an assumed transaction close date of December 31, 2021, this analysis implied\na range of per share values for Cornerstone common stock of approximately $23.77 to $53.27.\nBased on the analysis of the NTM EBITDA Multiple for each of the selected transactions Qatalyst Partners selected\na representative range of 10.5x to 20.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment) and\napplied that range to Cornerstone\u2019s adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period ending on June 30, 2022 of $278\nmillion, based on the Analyst Projections. Based on the same fully diluted share count calculation as used for the\nanalysis utilizing NTM Revenue Multiples above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Cornerstone\ncommon stock of approximately $27.21 to $61.60.\nBased on the analysis of the NTM LFCF Multiple for each of the selected transactions Qatalyst Partners selected a\nrepresentative range of 13.0x to 22.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment) and\napplied that range to Cornerstone\u2019s estimated levered free cash flow for the twelve-month period ending on June 30,\n2022 of $224 million based on the Analyst Projections (and increased to normalize for one-time Saba-related\nintegration cash expenses over the same period). Based on the same fully diluted share count calculation as used for\nthe analysis utilizing NTM Revenue Multiples above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for\nCornerstone common stock of approximately $40.73 to $68.51.\nNo company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Cornerstone or the Merger. In\nevaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to general\nbusiness, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Cornerstone\u2019s control, such\nas the impact of competition on Cornerstone\u2019s business or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence\nof any material adverse change in Cornerstone\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial\nmarkets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the\ntransactions to which they are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining\nthe arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.\nBecause of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the Merger, Qatalyst Partners cautioned\nagainst placing undue reliance on this information.\nMiscellaneous\nIn connection with the review of the Merger by our Board of Directors, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of\nfinancial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a\ncomplex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its\nopinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular\nweight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses,\nwithout considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying\nits analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given various analyses and factors more or less\nweight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other\nassumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not\nbe taken to be Qatalyst Partners\u2019 view of the actual value of Cornerstone. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst\nPartners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and\nfinancial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Cornerstone\u2019s control. Any estimates contained in\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nQatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nterms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Cornerstone common stock (other than Parent or any\naffiliate of Parent), to such holders. This analysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the price at which\nCornerstone common stock might actually trade at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and its presentation to our Board of Directors was one of many factors considered by our\nBoard of Directors in deciding to approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above\nshould not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of our Board of Directors with respect to the Merger\nConsideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders\nof shares of Cornerstone common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), or of whether our Board of\nDirectors would have been willing to agree to different consideration. The Merger Consideration payable in the\nMerger was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Cornerstone and Parent and was unanimously\napproved by our Board of Directors. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Cornerstone during these negotiations.\nQatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to Cornerstone or that any specific\nconsideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,\ndomestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these\nactivities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise\neffect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Cornerstone, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.\nDuring the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion, no material relationship existed between\nQatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and Cornerstone or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by\nQatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking\nand other financial services to Cornerstone, Parent, or Clearlake and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst\nPartners would expect to receive compensation.\nQatalyst Partners provided Cornerstone with financial advisory services in connection with the proposed Merger\nfor which it will be paid approximately $45,000,000, $4,000,000 of which was payable upon the delivery of its\nopinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon,\nand subject to, the consummation of the Merger. Cornerstone has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for\nits expenses incurred in performing its services. Cornerstone has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and\nits affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person\ncontrolling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal\nsecurities law, and certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 engagement.\nOpinion of Centerview Partners LLC",

In addition, Centerview reviewed publicly available\nfinancial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for Cornerstone and compared that data with similar\ndata for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that Centerview\ndeemed relevant.

The issuance of Centerview\u2019s opinion was approved\nby the Centerview Partners LLC Fairness Opinion Committee.\nSummary of Centerview Financial Analysis\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the Board of Directors in\nconnection with Centerview\u2019s opinion, dated August 5, 2021. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a\ncomplete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of,\nCenterview, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given\nto those financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable\nthan other assumptions, so the reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized\nbelow should not be taken to be Centerview\u2019s view of the actual value of Cornerstone. Some of the summaries of the\nfinancial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the\nfinancial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not\nconstitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the\ntables below without considering all financial analyses or factors or the full narrative description of such analyses\nor factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors, could create a\nmisleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview\u2019s financial analyses and its opinion. In\nperforming its analyses, Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general\nbusiness and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Cornerstone or any\nother parties to the Transaction. None of Cornerstone, Parent, Merger Sub or Centerview or any other person\nassumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in\nthese analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of Cornerstone\ndo not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which Cornerstone may actually be sold. Accordingly, the\nassumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is\nbased on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before August 5, 2021, the last trading day before\nthe public announcement of the Transaction, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTrading Multiples of Selected Public Companies Analysis\nCenterview reviewed certain financial information of Cornerstone and compared it to corresponding financial\ninformation of certain publicly traded companies that Centerview selected, based on its experience and professional\njudgment (which are referred to as the \u201cselected companies\u201d in this summary of Centerview\u2019s opinion). Although\nnone of the selected companies is directly comparable to Cornerstone, the companies listed below were chosen by\nCenterview because, among other reasons, they are publicly traded companies with certain operational, business\nand/or financial characteristics that, for purposes of Centerview\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to those of\nCornerstone.\nHowever, because none of the selected companies is exactly the same as Cornerstone, Centerview believed that it\nwas inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected public company\nanalysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional\njudgment, concerning differences between the operational, business and/or financial characteristics of Cornerstone\nand the selected companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which\nto consider the results of the quantitative analysis.\nUsing publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of August 4, 2021,\nCenterview calculated, for each selected company, among other things, (i) such company\u2019s implied fully-diluted\nenterprise value divided by the CY2022E Revenue Multiples and (ii) such company\u2019s CY2022E LFCF Multiples.\nThe selected companies are summarized below:\nSelected Companies\nCY2022E\nRevenue\nMultiple\nCY2022E\nLFCF \nMultiple\nBox, Inc.\n4.8x\n20.2x\nCeridian HCM, Inc.\n14.4x\nN/M(1)\nCheck Point Software Technologies LTD.\n5.9x\n15.2x\nCitrix Systems, Inc.\n4.6x\n12.0x\nDropbox, Inc.\n5.7x\n21.0x\nInovalon Holdings, Inc.(2)\n6.9x\nN/A(3)\nOpenText Corporation\n4.8x\n14.7x\nProgress Software Corporation\n4.3x\n12.2x\nQualys, Inc.\n8.4x\n26.4x\nSS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.\n5.1x\n15.7x\nUpland Software, Inc.\n4.6x\n19.7x\n(1)\n\u201cN/M\u201d Means not meaningful. Multiples greater than 50.0x or negative are considered not meaningful.\n(2)\nInovalon share price reflects unaffected date of July 26, 2021, prior to Nordic Capital takeover rumors.\n(3)\n\u201cN/A\u201d means not publicly available.\nBased on its analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and\nexperience, Centerview selected a reference range of CY2022E Revenue Multiples of 4.5x to 6.0x and a reference range\nof CY2022E LFCF Multiples of 12.0x to 20.0x. In selecting these ranges of CY2022E Revenue Multiples and CY2022E\nLFCF Multiples, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional judgment\nconcerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics of Cornerstone and the selected\ncompanies that could affect their public trading values in order to provide a context in which to consider the results\nof the quantitative analysis.\nCenterview applied the reference range of CY2022E Revenue Multiples to Cornerstone\u2019s 2022E Revenue of $908\nmillion, as provided by management of Cornerstone. Centerview then divided the result of the foregoing calculations\nby the number of fully-diluted shares of Cornerstone common stock outstanding (determined using the treasury\nstock method and taking into account outstanding restricted stock units, performance stock units and deferred stock\nunits and assuming net-share settlement of in-the-money convertible debt) as of August 2, 2021, as set forth in the\nInternal Data, to derive a range of implied values per share of Cornerstone common stock of $43.25 to $60.50, rounded\nto the nearest $0.25.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCenterview applied the reference range of CY2022E LFCF Multiples to Cornerstone\u2019s 2022E levered free cash flow of\n$271 million, as provided by management of Cornerstone. Centerview then divided the result of the foregoing\ncalculations by the number of fully-diluted shares of Cornerstone common stock outstanding (determined using the\ntreasury stock method and taking into account outstanding restricted stock units, performance stock units and\ndeferred stock units and assuming net-share settlement of in-the-money convertible debt) as of August 2, 2021, as\nset forth in the Internal Data, to derive a range of implied values per share of Cornerstone common stock of $45.00 to\n$72.25, rounded to the nearest $0.25.\nCenterview compared both of these ranges to the Merger Consideration of $57.50 per share in cash, without interest,\nto be paid to the holders of Cornerstone common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis\nCenterview reviewed and compared certain information relating to the following selected transactions that\nCenterview, based on its experience and professional judgment (which are referred to as the \u201cselected transactions\u201d\nin this summary of Centerview\u2019s opinion), deemed relevant to consider in relation to Cornerstone and the Merger.\nHowever, because none of the selected transactions used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to the\nMerger, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results\nof the selected transaction analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its\nexperience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the operational, business or financial\ncharacteristics of Cornerstone and each target company as well as the Merger and the selected transactions that\ncould affect the transaction values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the\nquantitative analysis. Although none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, the selected\ntransactions listed below were selected, among other reasons, based on Centerview\u2019s experience and professional\njudgment, because the selected transactions have certain characteristics that, for the purposes of this analysis, may\nbe considered similar to certain characteristics of the Merger. The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding\neach of the selected transactions analyzed were diverse and there are inherent differences in the business,\noperations, financial conditions and prospects of Cornerstone and the target companies included in the selected\ntransactions analysis.\nUsing publicly available information obtained from SEC filings, Wall Street research, Capital IQ and other data\nsources, Centerview calculated, for each selected transaction, among other things, (i) the NTM Revenue Multiple and\n(ii) the NTM EBITDA Multiple for each selected transaction.\nThe selected transactions considered in this analysis are summarized below:\nDate\nAnnounced\nTarget\nAcquiror\nNTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nNTM \nEBITDA \nMultiple\n06/01/21\nCloudera, Inc.\nKKR and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice\n5.4x\n31.1x\n10/14/19\nSophos Group plc\nThoma Bravo\n5.0x\n30.8x\n11/12/18\nathenahealth, Inc.\nVeritas Capital\n3.9x\n13.7x\n2/23/18\nMYOB Group Ltd.\nKKR\n4.9x\n12.1x\n11/27/17\nBarracuda Networks, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n3.6x\n18.8x\n10/23/17\nBroadSoft, Inc.\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n4.6x\n18.3x\n11/20/16\nLifeLock Inc.\nSymantec Corporation\n3.3x\n24.0x\n09/19/16\nInfoblox Inc.\nVista Equity Partners\n3.6x\n19.4x\n07/07/16\nAVG Technologies\nAvast Software\n3.2x\n9.0x\n09/13/15\nSolera Holdings, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners\n5.2x\n13.4x\n04/07/15\nInformatica Corporation\nPermira Advisers and Canada Pension\nPlan Investment Board\n4.3x\n18.1x\nBased on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the target companies in the selected transactions and other\nconsiderations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and experience, Centerview selected a\nreference range of NTM Revenue Multiples of 3.5x to 5.0x and NTM EBITDA Multiples of 14.0x to 20.0x. In selecting\nthese reference ranges, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexperience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating\ncharacteristics and prospects of Cornerstone and the target companies included in the selected transactions and\nother factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of such companies or Cornerstone.\nCenterview applied these reference ranges to Cornerstone\u2019s projected NTM Revenue of $883 million and NTM\nEBITDA of $312 million as of June 30, 2021, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for Cornerstone. Centerview\nsubtracted from this range of implied enterprise values Cornerstone\u2019s net debt of approximately $979 million as of\nJune 30, 2021, as provided by management of Cornerstone, to derive a range of implied equity values for Cornerstone.\nCenterview then divided the result of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully-diluted shares of Cornerstone\ncommon stock outstanding (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding\nrestricted stock units, performance stock units and deferred stock units and assuming cash settlement of in-the-\nmoney convertible notes, including (if applicable) the value of any additional make-whole shares based on an\nassumed transaction close date of December 31, 2021) as of August 2, 2021, as set forth in the Internal Data, to derive\na range of implied values per share of Cornerstone common stock of $29.50 to $47.00 for Cornerstone\u2019s NTM\nRevenue and $46.50 to $70.25 for Cornerstone\u2019s NTM EBITDA, each rounded to the nearest $0.25.\nCenterview compared this range to the Merger Consideration of $57.50 per share in cash, without interest, to be paid\nto the holders of Cornerstone common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nCenterview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Cornerstone based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range\nPlan. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset or\nset of assets by calculating the \u201cpresent value\u201d of estimated future cash flows of the asset or set of assets. \u201cPresent\nvalue\u201d refers to the current value of future cash flows and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows by a\ndiscount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of\ncapital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.\nIn performing this analysis, Centerview calculated an implied per share equity range for the shares of Cornerstone\ncommon stock by discounting to present value as of June 30, 2021, using discount rates ranging from 8.25% to\n10.00% (reflecting Centerview\u2019s analysis of Cornerstone\u2019s weighted average cost of capital) and the mid-year\nconvention, the forecasted unlevered free cash flows of Cornerstone (burdened for stock-based compensation\nexpense based on discussions with Cornerstone management) based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan for\ncalendar year 2021 through calendar year 2025. The implied terminal value of Cornerstone at the end of the forecast\nperiod was estimated by using terminal unlevered free cash flow multiples ranging from 15.0x to 20.0x (which were\nchosen based on Centerview\u2019s professional judgment).\nBased on its analysis, Centerview calculated a range of implied enterprise values of Cornerstone. Centerview\nsubtracted from this range of implied enterprise values Cornerstone\u2019s net debt of approximately $979 million as of\nJune 30, 2021, as provided by management of Cornerstone, to derive a range of implied equity values for Cornerstone.\nCenterview then divided the result of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully-diluted shares of Cornerstone\ncommon stock outstanding (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding\nrestricted stock units, performance stock units and deferred stock units outstanding and assuming net-share\nsettlement of in-the-money convertible debt) as of August 2, 2021, as set forth in the Internal Data, to derive a range\nof implied values of Cornerstone common stock of $50.75 to $71.25 per share, rounded to the nearest $0.25.\nCenterview compared this range to the Merger Consideration of $57.50 per share in cash, without interest, to be paid\nto the holders of Cornerstone common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOther Factors\nCenterview noted for the Board of Directors certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including,\namong other things, the following:\n\u2022\nHistorical Stock Price Trading Analysis: Centerview reviewed historical closing trading prices of the\nshares of Cornerstone common stock during the 52-week period ending on August 4, 2021, which reflected\nlow and high stock intraday prices for Cornerstone common stock during such period of $33.75 to $55.25\nper share, rounded to the nearest $0.25\u037e\n\u2022\nAnalyst Price Target Analysis: Centerview reviewed stock price targets for the shares of Cornerstone\ncommon stock in publicly available Wall Street research analyst reports, as of August 4, 2021, which\nindicated low and high stock price targets for Cornerstone common stock ranging from $45.00 to $83.00 per\nshare\u037e and\n\u2022\nPrecedent Premiums Paid Analysis: Centerview reviewed premiums paid in selected transactions\noccurring in the ten (10) years prior to the date of Centerview\u2019s opinion in which a public U.S.-based target\nwas acquired in a transaction valued from $2.5 billion to $10.0 billion and for which premium data was\navailable, excluding transactions in the financial services, real estate and energy sectors. The premiums in\nthis analysis were calculated by comparing the per share acquisition price in each transaction to, among\nother things, the closing price of the target company\u2019s common stock for the date one day prior to the date\non which the trading price of the target\u2019s common stock was perceived to be affected by a potential\ntransaction. Based on this analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its\nprofessional judgment, Centerview applied a range of 18% to 47% (representing the 25th and 75th percentile\nof premiums) to the closing stock price of Cornerstone common stock on the Unaffected Date of $43.96,\nwhich resulted in an implied per share price range of approximately $52.00 to $64.50 per share of\nCornerstone common stock.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most\nappropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular\ncircumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its\nopinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis that it\nconsidered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional\njudgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.\nCenterview\u2019s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of\nDirectors in its evaluation of the Transaction. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as\ndeterminative of the views of the Board of Directors or the management of Cornerstone with respect to the Merger\nConsideration or as to whether the Board of Directors would have been willing to determine that a different\nconsideration was fair. The Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between\nCornerstone and Parent and was approved by the Board of Directors. Centerview provided advice to Cornerstone\nduring these negotiations. Centerview did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to\nCornerstone or the Board of Directors or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate\nconsideration for the Transaction.\nCenterview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment\nbanking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion,\nCenterview was engaged to provide financial advisory services to Cornerstone, including in connection with its\nacquisition of Saba in 2020, and Centerview has received approximately $9 million in compensation from Cornerstone\nfor such services. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview had not been engaged to\nprovide financial advisory or other services to Parent, Merger Sub or Clearlake, and Centerview had not received any\ncompensation from Parent, Merger Sub or Clearlake. Centerview may provide financial advisory and other services to\nor with respect to Cornerstone or Parent or their respective affiliates and portfolio companies of Clearlake in the\nfuture, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 directors,\nofficers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview\u2019s affiliates or related\ninvestment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial\ninterests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other\nsecurities or financial instruments (including\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nderivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, Cornerstone, Parent, Clearlake or any of their\nrespective affiliates and portfolio companies of Clearlake, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.\nThe Board of Directors selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Transaction based on\nCenterview\u2019s reputation and experience. Centerview is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has\nsubstantial experience in transactions similar to the Transaction.\nIn connection with Centerview\u2019s services as the financial advisor to the Board of Directors, Cornerstone has agreed\nto pay Centerview an aggregate fee of $24 million, $4 million of which was payable upon the rendering of\nCenterview\u2019s opinion and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. In\naddition, Cornerstone has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview\u2019s expenses arising, and to indemnify Centerview\nagainst certain liabilities that may arise, out of Centerview\u2019s engagement.",

Stockholders should be aware that the fair value of their shares could be more than, the\nsame as or less than the Merger Consideration and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to,\nand does not otherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any stockholder contemplating the\nexercise of such appraisal rights should review carefully the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, particularly the\nprocedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights.\nThe following is a summary of the procedures to be followed by stockholders that wish to exercise their appraisal\nrights under Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached to this proxy as Annex D. This summary\ndoes not purport to be a complete statement of, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, Section 262 of the\nDGCL. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder\nof shares immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as\n64TABLE OF CONTENTS\nto which appraisal rights are asserted. A person holding a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name\nof another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the stockholder of record to follow the\nsteps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. Failure to follow any of the\nprocedures of Section 262 of the DGCL may result in termination or waiver of appraisal rights under Section 262\nof the DGCL. Stockholders should assume that the Company will take no action to perfect any appraisal rights of any\nstockholder.\nAny stockholder who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the\nDGCL and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The\nfollowing summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that\nCompany stockholders exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger is approved under Section 251(h), either a constituent corporation\nbefore the effective date of the merger, or the surviving corporation within 10 days thereafter, shall notify each of the\nstockholders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the\napproval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or\nseries of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy\nstatement constitutes the formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and the required copy of\nSection 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. Any stockholder who wishes to exercise\nsuch appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so should review the following discussion\nand Annex D carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified may result in the\nloss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nIf a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\ndeliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Cornerstone common stock prior\nto the later of the taking of the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and 20 days after the mailing of this\nproxy statement. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or\nvote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d or\nfailing to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for\nappraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL\u037e\n\u2022\nnot vote, or abstain from voting, his, her or its shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\ncontinuously hold of record the shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made\nthrough the Effective Time of the Merger\u037e and\n\u2022\ncomply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights thereafter, including\nfiling of a petition in the Delaware Court requesting a determination of the fair value of your shares of\ncommon stock within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger.\nWithin 10 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will provide notice of the effective\ndate of the Merger to those stockholders of the Company who have properly made a written demand for appraisal\npursuant to the first bullet above, as required by Section 262 of the DGCL, has not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and has not withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal. If the Merger is consummated,\na failure to make a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the time periods specified in the first bullet above\n(or to take any of the other steps specified in the above bullets) will be deemed to be a waiver or a termination of your\nappraisal rights. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, any stockholder who has\ndemanded an appraisal, but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named\nparty, has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration, without interest, specified by\nthe Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares. Any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective\nTime of the Merger will require the written approval of the Surviving Corporation and no appraisal proceeding before\nthe Delaware Court as to any stockholder will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court. Such\napproval may be conditioned upon any terms the Delaware Court deems just\u037e provided, however, that this provision\nwill not affect the right of any stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined such\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nproceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in\nthe Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time of the Merger. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a\nstockholder\u2019s request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when the approval is required or if the Delaware Court does\nnot approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder would be entitled to receive only the appraised\nvalue determined in any such appraisal proceeding. This value could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the\nvalue of the per share Merger Consideration.\nWritten Demand by the Stockholder\nAll written demands for appraisal should be addressed to the Company, 1601 Cloverfield Blvd., Suite 620 South Santa\nMonica, California 90404. Attention: General Counsel. The demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the\nstockholder of record, fully and correctly, as such stockholder\u2019s name appears on the stockholder\u2019s certificates\n(whether in book entry or on physical certificates) evidencing such stockholder\u2019s shares. If the shares are owned of\nrecord in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be made in that\ncapacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,\nthe demand must be made by or for all owners of record. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners,\nmay execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record, but such agent must identify the record owner or\nowners and expressly disclose in such demand that the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners of\nsuch shares.\nA beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions\nas may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the stockholder of record. If\nshares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the shares through a central\nsecurities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on\nbehalf of the depository nominee, and must identify the depository nominee as the stockholder of record. Any\nbeneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights and holds shares through a nominee holder is responsible\nfor ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the stockholder of record. The beneficial holder of the\nshares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the stockholder of record\nof the shares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares have been so deposited.\nA record stockholder, such as a broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, who holds shares as a nominee\nfor several beneficial owners (may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial\nowners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners. In such case, the\nwritten demand for appraisal must set forth the number of shares covered by such demand. Unless a demand for\nappraisal specifies a number of shares, such demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of such\nstockholder.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any\nstockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may\ncommence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court demanding a determination of the fair\nvalue of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal rights who did not vote their shares in favor of the\nMerger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares. If no such petition is filed within that 120-day period,\nappraisal rights will be lost for all stockholders who had previously demanded appraisal of their shares. The\nCompany is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition and stockholders should not\nassume that the Company will file a petition or that it will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the\nshares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal\nrights in respect of the shares within the period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements for\nexercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a\nstatement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\nand with respect to which Cornerstone has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of\nstockholders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after a written request therefor has been\nreceived by the Surviving Corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndelivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement that a demand for\nappraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of the shares, a person who is the beneficial owner of\nshares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to which demand has been\nproperly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person's own name, file a petition for appraisal or request\nfrom the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by any stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving\nCorporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the\npetition to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (the \u201cVerified List\u201d) containing the names\nand addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares (the \u201cDissenting Stockholders\u201d)\nand with whom agreements as to the value of their shares has not been reached. Upon the filing of a petition by a\nDissenting Stockholder, the Delaware Court may order a hearing and that notice of the time and place fixed for the\nhearing on the petition will be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all the Dissenting Stockholders shown on the\nVerified List. Notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general\ncirculation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication deemed advisable by the\nDelaware Court. The costs relating to these notices will be borne by the Surviving Corporation.\nIf a hearing on the petition is held, the Delaware Court is empowered to determine which Dissenting Stockholders\nhave complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and are entitled to an appraisal of their shares. The\nDelaware Court may require that Dissenting Stockholders submit their Share certificates, if any, to the Delaware\nRegister in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court is\nempowered to dismiss the proceedings as to any Dissenting Stockholder who does not comply with such\nrequirement. Accordingly, Dissenting Stockholders are cautioned to retain their Share certificates after the Effective\nTime and thereafter comply with all orders of the Delaware Court in respect of such certificates. In addition, assuming\nthe shares remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the Effective Time, which we expect to\nbe the case, the Delaware Court is required to dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all Dissenting Stockholders\nunless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares eligible for appraisal\nor (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal\nproceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court will determine the fair value of the shares\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with\ninterest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court in its\ndiscretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the\ndate of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time\nof the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the entry of judgment in the\nproceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in\nwhich case interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid\nby the Surviving Corporation and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court, and (ii) interest\naccrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court is to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc.,\nthe Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an\nappraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201cfair price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Delaware Court must consider market value, asset\nvalue, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of\nthe date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. In Weinberger, the\nSupreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which\nare known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion that does not\nencompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from\nsuch accomplishment or expectation. An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial\npoint of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the\nDGCL. You should be aware that the fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be\nmore than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive under\nthe terms of the Merger Agreement.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or by stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding,\nthe Delaware Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the\nstockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the Verified List and who has\nsubmitted such stockholder\u2019s stock certificates, if any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery, if such is required, may\nparticipate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights.\nWhen the fair value of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of such value, with\ninterest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled thereto, forthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or\nupon surrender by certificated stockholders of their stock certificates. The Delaware Court\u2019s decree may be enforced\nas other decrees in the Delaware Court may be enforced. The Delaware Court may also (i) determine the costs of the\nproceeding (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) and tax such costs upon the\nparties as the Delaware Court deems equitable and (ii) upon application of a stockholder, order all or a portion of the\nexpenses incurred by any Dissenting Stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all\nthe shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses. Determinations\nby the Delaware Court are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nStockholders considering whether to seek appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined\nunder Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration to\nbe paid in the Merger. Although the Company believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is\nmade as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court. Neither Parent nor the\nCompany anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Dissenting Stockholder, and each of Parent\nand the Company reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the\nDGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares is less than the Merger Consideration.\nThe process of dissenting and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with technical prerequisites.\nStockholders wishing to exercise their appraisal rights should consult with their own legal counsel in connection with\ncompliance with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nAny stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL\nwill not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote his or her shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of\ndividends or other distributions thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders as of a date\nprior to the Effective Time.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully\nwithdraws or loses such stockholder\u2019s right to appraisal, such stockholder\u2019s shares will be deemed to have been\nconverted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or\neffectively lose, the stockholder's right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the\neffective date of the Merger. Inasmuch as the Company has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present\nintention to do so, any stockholder who desires such a petition is advised to file it on a timely basis. In addition, a\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may\nwithdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and accept the Merger\nConsideration by delivering to the Company a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for appraisal and\nacceptance of the terms of the Merger either within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with\nthe written approval of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court\nwill be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court, and such approval may be\nconditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndeems just\u037e provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence will not affect the right of any stockholder\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the Merger Consideration within 60 days after the effective date of\nthe Merger.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL\nNOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL\nRECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.\nThe foregoing summary of the rights of the stockholders of the Company to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law\ndoes not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by the stockholders of the Company\ndesiring to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section\n262 of the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions of the\nDGCL.

This summary is general in nature and does not\ndiscuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a stockholder in light of its particular\ncircumstances. In addition, this summary does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any\nstate, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income\ntaxation. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury\nRegulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject\nto change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.

WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX\nADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nMERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT\nAND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL OR\nNON-U.S. TAX LAWS.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is (or is treated as) a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of\none or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) that has a valid\nelection in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares\nsurrendered pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of shares (that is,\nshares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the\namount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one\nyear at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers are currently\ntaxed at preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nThe following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a\nNon-U.S. Holder. The term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of common stock that is, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, not a U.S. Holder nor an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSpecial rules, not discussed herein, may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders, such as:\n\u2022\ncertain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ncontrolled foreign corporations\u037e\n\u2022\npassive foreign investment companies\u037e\n\u2022\ncorporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax\u037e and\n\u2022\npass-through entities, or investors in such entities.\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States\n(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed\nbase maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder\nis a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate\nunder an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty),\nwhich gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder if the Non-U.S.\nHolder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses\u037e or\n\u2022\nCornerstone is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is defined in\nSection 897(c) of the Code (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the\nMerger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock\n(the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d) and, if shares of Cornerstone\u2019s common stock are regularly traded on an\nestablished securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder\nowns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than 5% of our common stock at any\ntime during the Relevant Period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates\ngenerally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch\nprofits tax will not apply. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not,\nand have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a\nholder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS\nForm W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a certification of such holder\u2019s\nforeign status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (ii) otherwise\nestablishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts\nwithheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\n71\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe foregoing summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to particular\nholders of common stock. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences\nto them of exchanging their common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger under any federal, state, local or non-U.S.\ntax laws.\nWithholding on Foreign Entities\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (\u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain\npayments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under these rules) unless such institution\nenters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the\nU.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes\ncertain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with\nU.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on\ncertain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a\ncertification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An\nintergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these\nrequirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.\nSubject to the proposed Treasury Regulations described below, FATCA will apply to gross proceeds from sales or\nother dispositions of common stock after December 31, 2018. The Treasury Department released proposed\nregulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding tax of 30% applicable to\nthe gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the\nU.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations\nare issued.\nProspective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of\nFATCA on the disposition of common stock pursuant to the Merger.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

            "text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nCornerstone and Parent have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to\nconsummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain acquisitions may not be completed until\ninformation has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the Federal\nTrade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and the applicable HSR Act waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act is 30 calendar days, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or extended. The Merger\nis subject to the provisions of the HSR Act and therefore cannot be completed until each of Cornerstone and\nClearlake file a notification and report form with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting\nperiod has expired or been terminated. Cornerstone and Clearlake made the necessary filings with the Antitrust\nDivision of the DOJ and the FTC on August 19, 2021.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary\nor desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of\nsubstantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing\nrelationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding\nthe termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state or foreign jurisdiction could take\nsuch action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could\ninclude seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.\nPrivate parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be\ncertain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nGerman Antitrust Approval\nGerman Arc imposes a pre-merger notification requirement on transactions that qualify as concentrations in the\nmeaning of the law and meet certain specified turnover or transaction value thresholds, which the present\n72TABLE OF CONTENTS\nmerger meets. Accordingly, consummation of the merger is conditional upon the merger being cleared by the FCO.\nClearance is considered granted if, after a transaction has been notified, the applicable one-month waiting period\nexpires without the decision by the FCO to open Phase II proceedings or if the FCO explicitly clears the transaction\nbefore the expiration of the waiting period. If the FCO initiates Phase II proceedings, clearance is granted by way of a\nformal decision, or, if the decision is not served upon the notifying undertakings within a period of five months from\nreceipt of the complete notification, is deemed to be granted. Clearlake notified the FCO of the proposed transaction\non August 23, 2021 and received clearance for the transaction from the FCO on September 3, 2021.\nAustrian Antitrust Approval\nThe Austrian Cartel Act imposes a pre-merger notification requirement on transactions that qualify as concentrations\nin the meaning of the law and meet certain specified turnover or transaction value thresholds, which the present\nmerger meets. Accordingly, consummation of the merger requires notification of the merger to the\nBundeswettbewerbsbeh\u00f6rde (Austrian Federal Competition Authority, \u201cFCA\u201d), Clearance is considered granted if,\nafter a transaction has been notified, the applicable four week waiting period expires without the FCA or the\nBundeskartellanwalt (Federal Cartel Prosecutor) applying to open Phase II proceedings, or if they waive the opening\nof Phase II proceedings prior to the expiry of that waiting period. If Phase II proceedings are initiated, clearance is\ngranted by way of a formal decision of the Austrian Cartel Court, or, if the decision is not taken within a period of five\nmonths, is deemed to be granted. Clearlake notified the FCA of the proposed transaction on August 23, 2021.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nOne or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when\nit grants the necessary approvals and consents. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or\nlitigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude\nobtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the\nrequired regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial\nperiod of time between the approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that\nthese regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these\nregulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the\nMerger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These\nconditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.\nLegal Proceedings",
