If our\nstockholders fail to approve the Merger Proposal, the Merger will not occur. For more information, see the sections of\nthis proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d\nNo matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the Special Meeting.\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has approved, adopted and declared advisable the\nMerger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, and determined that the Merger Agreement and the\nTransactions are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders.

As of the close of business on the record date, 80,677,246 shares of Common Stock were\noutstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.\n \n2TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe presence at the Special Meeting, virtually or represented by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of the\nvoting power of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of Aerojet Rocketdyne will constitute a quorum at the\nSpecial Meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the\nSpecial Meeting, we expect that the Special Meeting will be adjourned to a later date.\nAn abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either virtually or by proxy, but abstains from\nvoting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If your\nshares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to\nvote your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote on your behalf as to any of the proposals, and\nyour shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of\nbusiness at the Special Meeting.\nRequired Vote\nEach share of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote\non each of the proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting.\nFor the Company to complete the Merger, a majority of the outstanding shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common\nStock must vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, assuming a quorum is present. An abstention as to the Merger\nProposal, or a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other\nnominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d this proposal.\nApproval of each of (i) the Compensation Proposal and (ii) the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative\nvote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting\nand that vote thereon, but is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. An abstention as to either proposal or a\nfailure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure of your broker,\nbank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a quorum\nis present.\nAs of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the\naggregate, approximately 731,905 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 0.9% of the outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that\nthey intend to vote all of their shares of Common Stock: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation\nProposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nVoting\u037e Proxies\u037e Revocation\nTo ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide\nvoting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually.\nShares of Common Stock Held in the Stock Fund of the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan\nIf you are a participant in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan, the enclosed proxy card will also\nserve to provide voting instructions to by Fidelity Management Trust Company, the trustee of the Aerojet\nRocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), with respect to any shares of the Stock Fund attributable to\nyour account under the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan. You may provide such instructions to the\nTrustee by following the instructions on the proxy card. If you provide voting instructions by mail, telephone, or the\nInternet, the Trustee will vote your shares as you have directed (or not vote your shares, if that is your direction). If\nyou do not provide voting instructions, the Trustee will vote your shares in the same proportion as shares for which\nthe Trustee has received voting instructions. You must submit voting instructions to the Trustee by no later than\n11:59 p.m. Eastern time on March 13, 2023, in order for your shares to be voted as you have directed by the Trustee at\nthe Special Meeting. Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan participants may not vote their Plan shares\nvirtually at the Special Meeting.\n \n3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nShares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods\ndescribed below.\nSubmit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with\ninstructions for submitting voting instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the\nInternet by accessing the Internet address specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares of Common Stock will\nbe voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as\ndescribed below.\nSubmit a Proxy Card by Mail. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is\nreceived in time for the Special Meeting, your shares of Common Stock will be voted in the manner directed by you\non your proxy card. If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy\nwill be voted in favor of each of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If\nyou fail to return your proxy card or vote by telephone or via the Internet, and you are a holder of record on the\nrecord date, unless you attend the Special Meeting virtually and vote electronically, your shares of Common Stock\nwill not be considered present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the\nSpecial Meeting, which will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal and, assuming a quorum\nis present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held in \u201cStreet Name\u201d\nIf your shares of Common Stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in \u201cstreet name,\u201d\nyour broker, bank or other nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your\nshares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to provide voting instructions by\ntelephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.\nIn accordance with applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of\nCommon Stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares as to (i)\nthe Merger Proposal, (ii) the Compensation Proposal or (iii) the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, if brokers, banks\nor other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they cannot\nvote such shares as to these proposals. Therefore, unless you attend the Special Meeting virtually with a properly\nexecuted legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker,\nbank or other nominee will result in your shares of Common Stock not being present at the meeting and not being\nvoted on any of the proposals. As a result, a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure to\ninstruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal, but it will have no effect on the other proposals, assuming a quorum is present.\nIf you choose to vote by telephone or by Internet, you do not have to return your proxy card or voting\ninstruction card. However, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting via the Internet, we recommend that you\nvote your shares in advance so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting via the\nInternet.\nRevocation of Proxies\nAny person giving a proxy under this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it before it is voted. If\nyou are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting by:\n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures\ndescribed above at any time up to 11:59 P.M. Eastern time on March 15, 2023, or by completing, signing,\ndating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nattending the Special Meeting virtually and voting electronically\u037e or\n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation by mail to the Company, in care of the Corporate Secretary, at our\nheadquarters, 222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500, El Segundo, California 90245.\n4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPlease note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Special Meeting without taking\none of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your\nproxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by sending a written notice of revocation to the Company, you\nshould ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be\nreceived by the Company before the Special Meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the\ninstructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new\nvoting instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting\nelectronically at the Special Meeting if you obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other\nnominee in order to be able to vote electronically at the Special Meeting.",

For a discussion of these interests, see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger -\nInterests of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nHow many shares of Common Stock may Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s directors and officers vote?\nA:\nAs of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,\napproximately 731,905 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 0.9% of the outstanding shares of\n \n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCommon Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us\nthat they intend to vote all of their shares of Common Stock: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the\nCompensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?\nA:\nYes. If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal and who properly\ndemand appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section\n262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to have their shares appraised\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Common\nStock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together\nwith interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court.\nStockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal\ncounsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL\nrequirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the\nrelevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex D to this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\nA:\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger in 2023. However, completion of the\nMerger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the Merger, including the\nexpiration of the required regulatory waiting period under the HSR Act and the approval of Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s stockholders, which are described in this proxy statement, and we cannot be certain when or if the\nconditions to the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for\nany other reason, the Company\u2019s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock in\nconnection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain a public company, and shares of Common Stock\nwill continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on the NYSE. In the event\nthat either Aerojet Rocketdyne or L3Harris terminates the Merger Agreement, then, in certain specified\ncircumstances, Aerojet Rocketdyne may be required to pay L3Harris the Company Termination Fee, or L3Harris\nmay be required to pay Aerojet Rocketdyne the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable. For more information, see\nthe sections of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Company Termination Fee\u201d and \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement - Parent Termination Fee.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the Compensation Proposal? What will happen if\nstockholders do not approve this proposal?\nA:\nThe inclusion of the Compensation Proposal is required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(the \u201cSEC\u201d)\u037e however, the approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the\nMerger and the vote on the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote by stockholders and will not be binding\non the Company or L3Harris. If the Merger Proposal is approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders and the\nMerger is completed, the Merger-related compensation will be paid to the Company\u2019s named executive officers\nin accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if the Company\u2019s\nstockholders fail to approve this Compensation Proposal.\nQ:\nHow does the merger consideration compare to the market price of shares of Common Stock?\nA:\nThe merger consideration of $58.00 per share represents a 37% premium to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s closing stock\nprice on August 15, 2022 (the last full day of unaffected trading of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Common Stock).\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of Common Stock?\nA:\nWe urge you to read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated\nby reference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the Merger affects you. Your vote is important,\nregardless of the number of shares of Common Stock you own.\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVoting at the Special Meeting\nStockholders of record will be able to vote electronically at the Special Meeting. If you are not a stockholder of\nrecord but instead hold your shares of Common Stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee,\nyou must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be\nable to vote electronically at the Special Meeting.\nIt is not necessary to attend the Special Meeting virtually in order to vote your shares of Common Stock. To\nensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide\nvoting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually.\nAttending the Special Meeting virtually does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder\nYou can ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the Special Meeting by submitting your proxy\nvia:\n\u2022\nmail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed\npostage-paid envelope\u037e\n\u2022\ntelephone, by using the toll-free number 1-800-690-6903\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe Internet before the meeting date, at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2023SM.\nThe telephone and Internet voting before the meeting date facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59\nP.M. Eastern time on March 15, 2023.\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted\n\u201cFOR\u201d (i) the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Compensation Proposal and (iii) the Adjournment Proposal.\nWe encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on attending the Special Meeting virtually.\nA failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the approval of the Merger\nProposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held in \u201cStreet Name\u201d\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the\ndirections provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other\nnominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held in 401(k) Plan Account\nIf you hold shares in a Aerojet Rocketdyne 401(k) plan account, you should follow the directions provided by\nthe plan administrator or plan trustee regarding how to instruct the plan trustee how to vote your shares.\nQ:\nCan I revoke my proxy?\nA:\nYes. You can revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting. If you are a stockholder of\nrecord, you may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company in writing, in care of the Corporate Secretary, at\nour headquarters, 222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500, El Segundo, California 90245, or by submitting a new\nproxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above at any\ntime up to 11:59 P.M. Eastern time on March 15, 2023, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new\nproxy card by mail to the Company. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the Special Meeting\u037e\nhowever, simply attending the Special Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you\nwant to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by sending a written notice of\nrevocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of\nrevocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company before the Special Meeting.\n \n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your\nshares, you should instead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke\nyour prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may also revoke a prior proxy by\nvoting electronically at the Special Meeting if you obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker,\nbank or other nominee in order to be able to vote electronically at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?\nA:\nThe requisite number of shares to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares of\nCommon Stock outstanding on February 9, 2023, the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do\nnot vote, or abstain from voting, on the Merger Proposal, or if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to\ngive voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nThe requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of shares of\nCommon Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and that vote thereon. If you\nabstain from voting on (i) the Compensation Proposal and (ii) the Adjournment Proposal or if you do not return\nyour proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure of your broker, bank\nor other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), it will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a\nquorum is present.\nQ:\nWill my shares of Common Stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or held in another form of record ownership be\ncombined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares of Common Stock you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a\ndifferent stockholder (that is, your broker, bank, or other nominee) than any shares of Common Stock you hold\nof record, any shares of Common Stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be combined for voting purposes with\nshares of Common Stock held of record. Similarly, if you own shares of Common Stock in various registered\nforms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and\nwill need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Common Stock because they are held in a\ndifferent form of record ownership. Shares of Common Stock held by a corporation or business entity must be\nvoted by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the\nproxy card.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?\nA:\nIf your shares of Common Stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive\nmore than one proxy card or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting\ninstruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet) to ensure that all of\nyour shares of Common Stock are voted.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock before completion of the Merger?\nA:\nIn order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of Common Stock through completion\nof the Merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of Common Stock before completion of the Merger, you\nwill have transferred your right to receive the Merger Consideration.\nThe record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the completion of the\nMerger. If you transfer your shares of Common Stock after the record date but before the closing of the Merger,\nyou will have the right to vote at the Special Meeting but not the right to receive the Merger Consideration.\nQ:\nIf the Merger is completed, how do I obtain the Merger Consideration for my shares of Common Stock?\nA:\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, your shares of Common Stock will automatically be converted into the\nright to receive your portion of the Merger Consideration. After the Merger is completed, if your shares of\nCommon Stock are evidenced by stock certificates, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials\nfrom the paying agent for the Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of Common\nStock evidenced by stock certificates for the Merger Consideration (without interest and subject\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto any required tax withholding). If your shares of Common Stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank\nor other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if\nany, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the Merger\nConsideration (without interest and subject to any required tax withholding).\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nA:\nNo. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of Common\nStock with the proxy card. If the Merger is completed and if your shares of Common Stock are evidenced by\nstock certificates, the paying agent for the Merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and\ninstructions for exchanging your shares of Common Stock for the Merger Consideration (without interest and\nsubject to any required tax withholding).\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more\nstockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance\nnotice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of\nthe meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of\nCommon Stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding Common Stock, you\nmay have already received a householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if\nyou have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery\nof a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any\ntime to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.\nQ:\nWhere can I find more information about Aerojet Rocketdyne?\nA:\nYou can find more information about us from various sources described in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWho will solicit and pay the costs of soliciting proxies?\nA:\nThe Board is soliciting your proxy, and we will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. This includes the charges and\nexpenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of our\noutstanding Common Stock. Aerojet Rocketdyne has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. (\u201cD.F. King\u201d), a proxy\nsolicitation firm, to assist the Board in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting, and we expect to pay\nD.F. King approximately $20,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses.\nProxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, email, telephone, or via the Internet by D.F. King or, without\nadditional compensation, by certain of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s directors, officers and employees.\nQ:\nWho can help answer my other questions?\nA:\nIf you have more questions about the Merger or any of the other matters set forth in this proxy statement, or\nrequire assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of this document or\nthe enclosed proxy card, please contact D.F. King, which is acting as the proxy solicitation agent and\ninformation agent for Aerojet Rocketdyne in connection with the Special Meeting. Aerojet Rocketdyne\nstockholders can contact D.F.

If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is\nreceived in time for the Special Meeting, your shares of Common Stock will be voted in the manner directed by you\non your proxy card.\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted\nin favor of each of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If you fail to\nreturn your proxy card or vote by telephone or via the Internet, and you are a holder of record on the record date,\nunless you attend the Special Meeting and vote electronically, your shares of Common Stock will not be considered\npresent at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,\nwhich will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal and, assuming a quorum is present, will\nhave no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held in \u201cStreet Name\u201d\nIf your shares of Common Stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in \u201cstreet name,\u201d\nyour broker, bank or other nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your\nshares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to provide voting instructions by\ntelephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.\nIn accordance with applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of\nCommon Stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares as to (i)\nthe Merger Proposal, (ii) the Compensation Proposal or (iii) the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, if brokers, banks\nor other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they cannot\nvote such shares as to these proposals. Therefore, unless you attend the Special Meeting virtually with a properly\nexecuted legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker,\nbank or other nominee will result in your shares of Common Stock not being present at the meeting and not being\nvoted on any of the proposals. As a result, a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure to\ninstruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal, but it will have no effect on the other proposals, assuming a quorum is present.\nRevocation of Proxies\nAny person giving a proxy under this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it before it is voted. If\nyou are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting by:\n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures\ndescribed above at any time up to 11:59 P.M. Eastern time on March 15, 2023, or by completing, signing,\ndating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nattending the Special Meeting virtually and voting electronically\u037e or\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation by mail to the Company, in care of the Corporate Secretary, at our\nheadquarters, 222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500, El Segundo, California 90245.\nPlease note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Special Meeting without taking\none of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your\nproxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by sending a written notice of revocation to the Company, you\nshould ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be\nreceived by the Company before the Special Meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the\ninstructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new\nvoting instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting\nelectronically at the Special Meeting if you obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other\nnominee in order to be able to vote electronically at the Special Meeting.\nAbstentions",

        "Background of the Merger": {
            "text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and\nplans, the Board and Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management periodically review, consider, and assess Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s capabilities, operations, financial performance, business plans and prospects, as well as overall\nindustry conditions, opportunities and risks for the Company as they may affect those strategic goals and plans.\nThis review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations,\nacquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, and other financial and strategic alternatives that might be in the\nbest interests of the Company and its stockholders on an ongoing basis.\nIn December 2020, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Lockheed Martin, pursuant to which the\nCompany would merge with and into a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin (the \u201cLockheed Martin transaction\u201d) in\nexchange for consideration of $51.00 per share in cash (exclusive of a $5.00 per share special one-time cash dividend\nthat was paid in March 2021). In all, the consideration contemplated by the Lockheed Martin transaction totaled\napproximately $5 billion in equity value and Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s stockholders voted to approve the transaction on\nMarch 9, 2021. On January 21, 2022, the FTC unanimously voted to issue an administrative complaint to block the\ntransaction, which was filed on January 25, 2022, and on February 13, 2022, Lockheed Martin delivered notice of\ntermination of the merger agreement resulting in abandonment of the Lockheed Martin transaction.\nIn the wake of the failure to consummate the Lockheed Martin transaction, disagreements arose within the\nBoard about various matters, including the future direction of the Company. As a result, a proxy fight ensued in\nwhich competing slates engaged in a proxy contest from January to June 2022. One proposed Board slate was led by\nthe CEO of the Company and the other proposed Board slate was led by the former Executive Chairman of the\nCompany. During the proxy contest, the competing slates each engaged with Company stockholders in discussions\nover the strategic direction of Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the \u201c2022 Special Meeting\u201d) at which the\ncurrent Board was elected (the slate led by the Company\u2019s CEO).\n27TABLE OF CONTENTS\nDuring the proxy contest, the members of the prevailing Board slate (including the newly proposed nominees)\nhad received input from many Company stockholders indicating their preference that the Board consider all of the\nCompany\u2019s potential strategic alternatives in order to determine a preferred path forward that was in the best interests\nof the Company. The prevailing Board slate committed to do that.\nTo carry out that commitment, the newly elected Board held a meeting on August 1, 2022, shortly after the 2022\nSpecial Meeting, to consider a report from members of the Company\u2019s senior management on, among other things,\nthe state of the business, the Company\u2019s financial performance, and its future outlook and prospects relative to\npotential strategic alternatives. The meeting was held by videoconference and, unless otherwise noted, all Board\nmeetings were held by videoconference. At this initial meeting, presentations were made by members of the\nCompany\u2019s senior management on the Company\u2019s standalone plan (the \u201cstrategic plan\u201d). The presentations also\ncovered the environment for mergers and acquisitions and the potential benefit to the Company of pursuing either an\nacquisition or a business combination with another aerospace and defense company. The presentations addressed\nthe comparative potential for the Company to grow and become more profitable through either acquiring other\ncomplementary assets or companies, executing its existing standalone strategic plan, or combining with a larger\nstrategic or financial acquiror. As to the last option, the Board was informed of unsolicited expressions of interest\nthat members of the Company\u2019s senior management and the Company\u2019s financial advisors had received from several\nindustry participants after the termination of the Lockheed Martin transaction. As a result of the discussion, the\nBoard directed members of the Company\u2019s senior management, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, to\nprepare a more detailed analysis of the full set of potential strategic alternatives available.\nThe next day, on August 2, 2022, consistent with the Board\u2019s direction that the Company\u2019s senior management\nconsider the Company\u2019s strategic alternatives and develop options for consideration by the Board, a meeting was\nheld in person between the Board\u2019s non-executive chair, Thomas A. Corcoran, and the Company\u2019s Chief Executive\nOfficer, Eileen P. Drake, along with members of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management and the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisors, Citi and Evercore, which had both served as the Company\u2019s financial advisors for the Lockheed Martin\ntransaction, and its legal advisor, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d). Members of the Company\u2019s\nsenior management presented, among other things, an overview of the Company\u2019s performance and an update on\ntrends in the aerospace and defense industry, and each of Citi and Evercore presented a review of potential strategic\nand financial buyers for Aerojet Rocketdyne if the Company were to pursue a sale or a business combination. During\nthe presentation, members of the Company\u2019s senior management discussed the unsolicited expressions of interest\nthat the Company had received in the wake of the termination of the Lockheed Martin transaction and the 2022\nSpecial Meeting from a number of third parties interested in a possible strategic transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nAn important aspect of the discussion of the Company\u2019s strategic alternatives focused on the utility in the industries\nin which the Company competed of having the resources to make desired capital expenditures and research and\ndevelopment investments. The discussion noted the difficulty for the Company to obtain the scale in its business\nlines that the Company desired through acquisitions, given that most of the potential acquisitions within the\nCompany\u2019s financial capacity would not help attain such scale, as compared to transactions in which a strategic\ncounterparty of comparable or much greater size might combine with or acquire the Company. A review of potential\nstrategic and financial counterparties was conducted, and the importance of ensuring a competitive process that\ninvolved viable strategic and financial counterparties who could consummate a potential transaction was discussed.\nThe merger and acquisition alternatives in light of the Company\u2019s strategic plan and standalone prospects were\nalso considered and discussed. In view of the failure of the Lockheed Martin transaction to secure regulatory\nclearance, the need for any potential transaction to, among other things, address regulatory risk and for the terms of\nany transaction to provide the Company with appropriate transactional certainty and protections in light of such risk\nwas also discussed. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Corcoran and Ms. Drake agreed that the Board should be\npresented at its next meeting with potential strategic alternatives and an assessment of its capital allocation options,\nincluding the possibility of proceeding with a full process to consider a potential combination of the Company with a\nstrategic or financial counterparty, which could take the form of, among other things, a potential sale of the Company\n(the \u201cstrategic process\u201d) and that the Company should work with its outside financial and legal advisors to prepare\nthe presentation materials and an illustrative timeline for the Board to review, discuss and consider.\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 15, 2022, before the proposed meeting with the Board was scheduled to be held, Bloomberg News\nreleased an article stating that Elliott Management (\u201cElliott\u201d) had acquired a 3.7% equity stake in the Company. In the\nsame period, representatives of Elliott reached out to Ms. Drake and sought a meeting with her. In a telephonic\ndiscussion with representatives of Elliott, the Elliott representatives expressed, among other things, potential interest\nin pursuing a potential transaction involving the Company.\nIn response to these developments, a meeting of the Board was convened on the same day for members of the\nCompany\u2019s senior management, Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore to brief the Board on the potential impact Elliott\u2019s\ninvestment and stated intentions could have on the Company. During this discussion, the importance of ensuring a\ncompetitive process that involved viable strategic and financial counterparties who could consummate a potential\ntransaction was emphasized again in the event that the Board ultimately determined to pursue a strategic process\nafter further informing itself regarding the Company\u2019s strategic alternatives at the upcoming Board meeting. The\nclosing price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Common Stock on August 15, 2022, the last trading day before\nElliott\u2019s position in the Company was released, was $42.49.\nOn August 18, 2022, members of the Company\u2019s senior management, Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore met with\nMr. Corcoran in his role as non-executive chair to discuss, among other things, potential strategic alternatives for the\nCompany, which included a further refined set of materials regarding a potential strategic process, including the range\nof potential counterparties, the trends for mergers and acquisitions in the defense and aerospace industry, the\nCompany\u2019s valuation compared to the Company\u2019s standalone strategic plan and the degree of regulatory risk\nassociated with each potential counterparty. After discussion, Mr. Corcoran expressed his desire that the advisors\njoin members of the Company\u2019s senior management to make the presentation to the Board on August 30. At this\nmeeting, Mr. Corcoran raised the fact that he was on the board of L3Harris but had recused himself from any\ndiscussion on the L3Harris board regarding the Company.\nOn August 23, 2022, a press report on Dealreporter indicated that Aerojet Rocketdyne was in discussions with a\nfew potential strategic buyers about a potential transaction. Aerojet Rocketdyne declined to comment on the report.\nOn August 30, 2022, the Board held a meeting, which was also attended by members of the Company\u2019s senior\nmanagement, Wachtell Lipton and, for a portion of the meeting, Citi and Evercore. During the meeting, the Board\naddressed certain issues relevant to the conduct of the strategic process if one was to be undertaken. These issues\nincluded, among other things, reviewing and approving, with input from Wachtell Lipton and without Citi or Evercore\npresent, the terms for updated engagement letters for each of Citi and Evercore as the Company\u2019s financial advisors.\nCiti and Evercore had served as the Company\u2019s financial advisors for the Lockheed Martin transaction. The Board\ndiscussed that Citi and Evercore had certain relationships with certain of the potential counterparties, but did not\nbelieve that it would have an impact on either firm with respect to their work for the Company.\nIn advance of the meeting, Citi and Evercore presented the Board with information about potential\ncounterparties for acquisition by the Company and potential counterparties that could potentially be interested in\nand capable of acquiring the Company. As to the latter category, the set of potential counterparties included 13\nstrategic defense and aerospace companies and nine financial sponsors. One of the potential counterparties was\nL3Harris. The list was later updated to add one additional potential strategic counterparty and then re-delivered to\nthe Board on August 31, 2022.\nConsistent with the Board\u2019s request at the August 1, 2022 meeting, the Board considered at length its strategic\noptions, with input from members of the Company\u2019s senior management, Citi, Evercore and Wachtell Lipton. As part\nof this consideration, Mr. Corcoran summarized three of the Company\u2019s potential strategic options: (1) execute the\nCompany\u2019s standalone strategic plan and defer consideration of mergers and acquisitions opportunities in the near\nterm, (2) consider acquisitions by the Company in order to obtain greater scale and other changes in its capital\nallocation\u037e or (3) undertake the strategic process, through which the Company would engage with potential strategic\nand financial counterparties to explore the opportunity for a business combination, including a potential sale of the\nCompany, to deliver value for Company stockholders and to provide the Company\u2019s business lines with greater scale\nand the capacity for growth and investment.\nWith input from members of the Company\u2019s senior management and financial and legal advisors, the Board\nreviewed each of the three options Mr. Corcoran had outlined. The discussion of the potential utility for a strategic\nmerger and acquisition process was accompanied by and came in the context of a review of the\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany\u2019s current strategic plan. To aid that discussion and consideration of the comparative advisability of the\nCompany\u2019s options, members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of each of Citi and Evercore\nprovided the Board certain preliminary financial analyses of Aerojet Rocketdyne on a standalone basis. Members of\nthe Company\u2019s senior management and Citi and Evercore each also discussed the aerospace and defense industry\ngenerally and trends in mergers and acquisitions transactions in the aerospace and defense industry and reviewed\nthe advantages and risks presented by potential candidates for acquisition by the Company and of the potential\nfinancial and strategic counterparties who might be interested in and capable of successfully combining with or\nacquiring the Company. The potential implications of regulatory risk, and in particular, investigations of or challenges\nto a potential transaction by antitrust regulators, was also the subject of the discussion in this context. The utility of\nfocusing on potential counterparties who did not pose regulatory issues similar to those in the abandoned Lockheed\nMartin transaction was discussed, as was the importance of ensuring that the form of any transaction agreement\nprovide the Company with as much certainty and protection to address regulatory risk as was achievable. The Board\nreceived information on, among other things, the types of provisions used to accomplish that end.\nThe Board was also provided with a potential framework and schedule for conducting a strategic process\ninvolving outreach to potential strategic and financial buyers, with a recommendation from each of the Company\u2019s\nsenior management, Citi and Evercore as to which should be the subject of outreach in light of their viability to be\ncounterparties in a transaction in the best interests of the Company.\nThroughout the course of the meeting, the Board weighed the potential benefits of outreach to counterparties\nagainst the potential risks of such a process, including the risks to employee retention and destabilization in the\nevent of a leak, and further considered the set of potential counterparties identified in the Board materials. At the end\nof the meeting, the Company\u2019s senior management recommended that the Company conduct the strategic process on\nthe suggested timeline, begin outreach to potential counterparties, and to further explore a business combination that\ncould provide necessary scale and resources for the Company\u2019s defense and space businesses to effectively\ncompete, while continuing to manage the Company in accordance with its strategic plan. Members of the Company\u2019s\nsenior management explained that, although the Company\u2019s standalone strategic plan was sound, its execution\ndepended on accessing a substantial amount of capital and deploying it towards the acceleration of capital\nexpenditures and investments in research and development. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management also\nemphasized that there were limited acquisition opportunities available that would increase the Company\u2019s scale. It\nwas noted that substantial interest had been expressed by potential counterparties with the capital to invest in the\nCompany\u2019s business lines and to engage in a transaction that would deliver value for the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nSenior management explained its view that proceeding with the strategic process was the Company\u2019s best path\nforward. Mr. Corcoran concurred with the recommendation from members of the Company\u2019s senior management and\nthe Board unanimously approved proceeding with the strategic process. Following further discussion, it was the\nBoard\u2019s view that the strategic process should focus on potential financial and strategic counterparties who might be\ncapable of successfully combining with or acquiring the Company without presenting heightened regulatory risk.\nOn September 1 and September 6, 2022, Ms. Drake spoke with L3Harris\u2019s CEO, Christopher E. Kubasik,\nregarding, among other things, L3Harris\u2019s potential interest in participating in a strategic process.\nIn accordance with the Board\u2019s direction, during the period between September 5, 2022 and October 14, 2022,\nrepresentatives of Citi and Evercore made initial contact with 17 potential transaction counterparties - 10 strategic\ncounterparties, including L3Harris, and seven financial sponsor counterparties - to gauge their interest in a potential\nstrategic transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne. Of those 17 counterparties, eight strategic counterparties, including\nL3Harris, and six financial sponsor counterparties entered into a non-disclosure and standstill agreement with Aerojet\nRocketdyne to begin conducting due diligence on the Company. Pursuant to the terms of these non-disclosure\nagreements, all standstill restrictions expired upon the announcement of a transaction or tender or exchange offer for\n50% or more of the Company\u2019s securities or assets, in each case solely to permit the counterparties to make an\nexpression of interest to submit a Superior Proposal. Three of the 17 parties contacted by representatives of Citi and\nEvercore chose not to engage in discussions with Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nOn September 23, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which members of the Company\u2019s senior management of\nAerojet Rocketdyne, Wachtell Lipton and, for a portion of the meeting, Citi and Evercore, were also present. At the\nmeeting, members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives of Citi and Evercore\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprovided an update of certain interactions and discussions held with the parties contacted in connection with\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s strategic process and discussion ensued with respect to the status of the strategic process.\nRepresentatives of Citi and Evercore also reviewed the 14 counterparties contacted by representatives of Citi and\nEvercore that chose to proceed in the strategic process and conduct due diligence. Members of the Company\u2019s\nsenior management reiterated to the Board the importance of confidentiality, of limiting outside contact by Board\nmembers with any of the potential counterparties and of treating all parties equally given the competitive and\nsensitive nature of the process. In the materials for the meeting, the Board had been provided informational materials\non certain actions the Company could take with respect to Elliott\u2019s recently disclosed position in order to permit the\nexploration of the strategic process without the effect of a significant position by Elliott in the Company\u2019s Common\nStock.\nBased upon advice from Wachtell Lipton, the Board also considered the fact that Mr. Corcoran was a director of\nL3Harris and that another director (\u201cDirector AA\u201d) was a director of another company in the industry that was\ndiscussed as a potential counterparty and had executed a non-disclosure agreement as part of the strategic process.\nWachtell Lipton informed the Board that, although overlapping service by certain directors on the board of a\npotential counterparty could pose conflict issues that should be accounted for in the future, the strategic process\nhad not yet begun and there were no concerns with Mr. Corcoran and Director AA participating fully in preliminary\ndiscussions regarding whether to pursue a strategic process. Wachtell Lipton noted, however, that, should the\nstrategic process proceed to a point at which specific offers from counterparties were received and the number of\nparties were narrowed, recusals and other actions to minimize the potential for any conflict of interest might become\nappropriate. Later in September, Director AA informed the Company that the other company for which they also\nserved as a director had requested that they recuse themselves entirely from the discussions regarding any strategic\nprocess on the boards of both companies. Consistent with such advice, Director AA did not participate in\ndiscussions regarding the strategic process in Board meetings. During the meeting, the Board also reviewed the\nmarketing materials and confidential information presentation that the Company planned to distribute to the 14\npotential counterparties that had executed a non-disclosure agreement in order to help them proceed with their due\ndiligence investigations and submit an initial indication of interest and accompanying price range for a transaction\nwith the Company (the \u201cinitial indications of interest\u201d).\nBeginning on September 27, 2022, representatives of Citi and Evercore sent a process email to each of the 14\npotential counterparties that had entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Aerojet Rocketdyne, requesting initial\nindications of interest by October 14, 2022.\nOn September 29, 2022, Ms. Drake and Mr. Kubasik spoke by telephone regarding the recusal of Mr. Corcoran\nfrom discussions about the strategic process relating specifically to L3Harris on the boards of both L3Harris and\nAerojet Rocketdyne.\nOn October 3, 2022, upon the announcement of L3Harris\u2019s acquisition of Viasat, Inc.\u2019s Tactical Data Links\nproduct line, the Company was informed that Citi had represented L3Harris in the transaction. When Citi\u2019s\nrelationship with L3Harris was considered by the Board at its August 30, 2022 meeting, the Board did not view Citi\u2019s\nwork for L3Harris as bearing on the strategic process that the Board was considering or that it would otherwise pose\na material issue for Citi with respect to their work for the Company.\nOn October 14, 2022, seven potential counterparties - five potential strategic counterparties, including L3Harris,\nand two potential financial sponsor counterparties - submitted initial indications of interest to acquire Aerojet\nRocketdyne (such parties, other than L3Harris, referred to as \u201cBidder A,\u201d \u201cBidder B,\u201d \u201cBidder C,\u201d \u201cBidder D,\u201d \u201cBidder\nE\u201d and \u201cBidder F\u201d). Bidder E was formed after two of the financial sponsors targeted in the initial outreach requested\nto form a single co-bidding group and the request was granted by the Company\u2019s management, following\nconsultation with the Company\u2019s financial and legal advisors. Bidder A indicated a price range of $52.00 - $55.00 per\nshare\u037e Bidder B indicated a price of $51.00 per share\u037e Bidder C indicated a price range of $47.00 - $52.00 per share\u037e\nBidder D declined to provide a written indication of value, noting that further diligence would be required\u037e and\nBidders E and F each indicated a price range of $50.00 - $52.00 per share. Despite having expressed substantial\ninterest in a potential transaction with the Company, L3Harris initially indicated a price range of $47.00 - $49.00.\nBecause L3Harris\u2019s initial price range was low compared with those of other bidders, despite its perceived strategic fit\nwith the Company and its financial capacity to conduct a transaction on terms favorable to the Company, members of\nthe Company\u2019s senior management and its financial and legal advisors determined it was advisable to inform L3Harris\nthat its initial price range was not\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncompetitive and that it risked exclusion from the strategic process. Mr. Corcoran was not involved in that decision or\nin any discussion regarding that decision. After the financial advisors of the Company so informed L3Harris, on\nOctober 15, 2022, L3Harris responded with an increased price range of $50.00 - $52.00 per share.\nOn October 18, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which members of the Company\u2019s senior management of\nAerojet Rocketdyne, Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore were also present. Before the full Board meeting, an executive\nsession of the entire Board was held, with the presence of members of the Company\u2019s senior management, and\nwithout the presence of any of the Company\u2019s outside advisors.\nThe purpose of the executive session was to again discuss, among other things, whether the directors wished to\nproceed with the ongoing strategic process that involved consideration of whether the Company might enter into a\nstrategic transaction with another company, or should instead concentrate all its resources at this time on executing\nthe Company\u2019s standalone strategic plan. In advance of the executive session, the Board had been provided with and\nhad reviewed input from members of the Company\u2019s senior management and outside advisors, which provided the\nBoard with, among other things, updated information about the Company\u2019s latest standalone strategic plan, its stock\nprice, the market conditions facing the Company and other relevant information, including a summary of the non-\nbinding indications of interest submitted by seven of the potential counterparties, which portion of such materials\nhad been redacted from the materials provided to Mr. Corcoran. Director AA recused themselves from the executive\nsession and did not receive the materials. After discussion, the Board was inclined, subject to receiving additional\ninput from members of the Company\u2019s senior management and the Company\u2019s outside advisors, to proceed with the\nstrategic process because it could yield a transaction that might be in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders.\nAt that time, the full Board meeting began and Wachtell Lipton summarized, among other things, the terms of the\ndraft merger agreement to be distributed to the subset of bidders selected to advance to the next round of the\nstrategic process, focusing in particular on provisions that would ensure a greater degree of closing certainty for the\nCompany. Consistent with the relevant counterparty\u2019s request in late September and with the Company\u2019s full assent,\nDirector AA recused themselves from the entirety of the full Board meeting and did not receive the materials.\nAt that time, Mr. Corcoran also recused himself from the meeting in light of his service on the L3Harris board of\ndirectors. Because of Mr. Corcoran\u2019s role as non-executive chair and because of the still-early stage of the strategic\nprocess, Wachtell Lipton advised that Mr. Corcoran\u2019s agreement to recuse as to any information or Board\ndeliberation relating specifically to L3Harris was sufficient for present purposes, but that more extensive recusal by\nMr. Corcoran might be required at a later time when it became necessary to consider specific offers from potential\ncounterparties, narrow the participants in the strategic process or to compare the utility of transactions with other\ncounterparties.\nAfter Mr. Corcoran had recused himself, representatives of Citi and Evercore presented the non-binding\nindications of interest submitted by seven of the potential counterparties - comparing the price ranges, early\nregulatory feedback and financing plans for each. Representatives of Citi and Evercore presented preliminary\nfinancial analyses of Aerojet Rocketdyne and it was noted that the price ranges offered by the bidders compared\nfavorably against the effective offer price of $51.00 per share in the Lockheed Martin transaction. Representatives of\nCiti and Evercore also reviewed, among other things, a timeline of next steps and summarized each party\u2019s\nengagement with the diligence process to date. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management recommended to the\nBoard that L3Harris and Bidders A, B, C, E and F be invited to participate in the next round of the strategic process,\nwhich would begin with a scheduled management presentation and further diligence, followed by a request for\nrevised bids from each bidder (the \u201crevised bids\u201d). The Board determined to proceed as recommended. With review\nof the individual bidders\u2019 submissions complete and the discussion of next steps concluded, Mr. Corcoran returned\nto the meeting and further discussion ensued about, among other things, the Company\u2019s preparedness in relation to\nthe previously discussed position disclosed by Elliott.\nIn accordance with the Board\u2019s directions, during the period between October 23, 2022 and November 3, 2022,\nrepresentatives of Citi and Evercore scheduled management presentations and further diligence processes, including\nsite visits where requested, with each of L3Harris and Bidders A, B, C, E and F. Executive leadership from each of the\nbidders attended separate management presentations with senior management of Aerojet Rocketdyne either via\nvideoconference or in person at Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s corporate headquarters in\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEl Segundo, California. During the course of this process, additional diligence material was uploaded to the virtual\ndata room, which was made available to each bidder. Bidders were also given the opportunity to ask supplemental\ndiligence questions of the Company\u2019s senior management regarding the diligence materials for the purpose of\ninforming the revised bids.\nOn October 25, 2022, a press report in Reuters indicated that Aerojet Rocketdyne was soliciting acquisition\noffers from a number of potential bidders. Aerojet Rocketdyne declined to comment on the report. The closing price\nper share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on October 24, 2022, the last trading day before the Reuters report\nwas issued, was $45.33.\nOn October 27, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting at which members of the Company\u2019s senior\nmanagement were present, but Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore were absent. The Board reviewed ordinary course\nitems for the Company\u2019s business. A brief update on the strategic process was given. The Board discussed these\nitems with members of the Company\u2019s senior management and the importance of confidentiality and an even hand\ntowards all potential counterparties was reiterated.\nOn November 4, 2022, representatives of Citi and Evercore sent a process letter by email to each of the six\npotential counterparties that had submitted initial indications of interest and were continuing to pursue a potential\ntransaction, requesting a revised bid by December 8, 2022, and explaining that each bidder would receive a draft\nmerger agreement so that they could submit an interim markup by November 30, 2022 for a preliminary round of\nfeedback from the Company to inform each bidder\u2019s submission of transaction documents on December 8, 2022\nalongside the revised bid.\nOn November 14, 2022, representatives of Citi and Evercore distributed an initial draft of the Merger Agreement\nto all six potential counterparties remaining in the strategic process, inviting counterparties, if they wished, to provide\nan initial markup on November 30, to allow the opportunity for interaction about the merger agreement draft before\nthe December 8 deadline for revised bids.\nOn November 19, 2022, Bidder F notified Citi and Evercore that it would withdraw from the strategic process\nafter determining it would be unable to submit a competitive revised bid.\nOn November 21, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which members of senior management of Aerojet\nRocketdyne, Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore were also present. Given the narrowing of the field of potential\ncounterparties, the fact that L3Harris was still an active potential counterparty and the need to consider potential\nrevised bids in relation to each other, it was determined that Mr. Corcoran should recuse himself from all Board\ndeliberations regarding the strategic process. For that reason, Mr. Corcoran recused himself from the entirety of the\nmeeting, as did Director AA.\nAt the meeting, the Board, with input from members of the Company\u2019s senior management and financial\nadvisors, reviewed, among other things, an update on the strategic process and a revised view of the Company\u2019s\nstandalone strategic plan, and determined that competitive pressures and other limitations, including the need for\ngreater scale and breadth of product diversity, continued to support the Company\u2019s pursuit of a strategic transaction.\nThe Board also reviewed, among other things, the degree of engagement in the process by each of the remaining\nbidders. Wachtell Lipton also summarized the key terms of the merger agreement draft that was distributed to all\nbidders in advance of the deadline for the revised bids, noting in particular the importance of the proposed reverse\nbreak fee, the \u201cticking\u201d fee and efforts covenants requiring the buyer to secure regulatory clearance, as well as each\nprovision\u2019s utility in ensuring more closing certainty and protection for the Company in the event a transaction did\nnot close. Wachtell Lipton also reviewed with the Board, among other things, the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in the\ncontext of a potential transaction, noting that the Board was entitled to rely on the expertise of its advisors\nthroughout the process and in making any final decision. At the end of the meeting, the Board directed members of\nthe Company\u2019s senior management and advisors to proceed with negotiations and diligence with each of the\nremaining five counterparties in pursuit of transaction on terms in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders.\nIn accordance with the Board\u2019s direction, during the period between November 21, 2022 and December 8, 2022,\nmembers of Company\u2019s senior management, Citi and Evercore continued to engage each of the bidders with diligence\ncalls and scheduled site visits for members of bidders\u2019 business and advisor teams (for those bidders that requested\nsite visits).\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 30, 2022, L3Harris, Bidder B and Bidder C each submitted initial markups of the merger agreement\nto Wachtell Lipton for feedback in advance of the December 8, 2022 deadline for revised bids. Over the following\ndays, Wachtell Lipton reviewed the terms of each markup with members of the Company\u2019s senior management and\nthe Company\u2019s financial advisors and provided feedback to each of the bidders. Bidder A and Bidder E did not\nsubmit markups of the merger agreement for feedback.\nOn December 3 and December 4, 2022, clean team agreements were entered into with each of L3Harris, Bidder A,\nBidder C and Bidder E to facilitate access to additional diligence materials in advance of the submission of revised\nbids.\nDuring the period from November 30, 2022 to December 8, 2022, Wachtell Lipton provided detailed feedback to\neach of L3Harris, Bidder B and Bidder C on their markups of the transaction documents.\nOn December 6, 2022, in advance of L3Harris\u2019s submission of a revised bid, Mr. Kubasik sent personal letters to\neach member of the Board concerning his company\u2019s interest in pursuing a transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nOn December 8, 2022, Bidder B and Bidder C each submitted revised bids. Bidder B offered $51.00 per share and\ndid not submit a revised markup of the transaction documents beyond what it had already submitted on November\n30, 2022. Bidder C offered $52.00 per share and submitted a further revised markup of the transaction documents.\nEach bid was for all-cash consideration with no financing contingency. L3Harris had advised that it would provide its\nrevised bid on December 9 after concluding its board meeting on that date.\nOn December 9, 2022, L3Harris submitted a revised bid, along with revised transaction documents, and Bidder E\nsubmitted only a revised price bid. L3Harris offered $57.00 per share and Bidder E offered $50.00 per share, each in all-\ncash consideration with no financing contingency. The closing price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock\non December 9, 2022, was $53.89.\nBidder A did not submit a revised bid and indicated that it had ultimately decided it was interested only in\npurchasing a part of, but not the entire Company. Citi and Evercore told Bidder A that the Company would welcome\nits return to the strategic process if it reconsidered that decision.\nOn December 10, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which members of the Company\u2019s senior management,\nWachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore were also present. Mr. Corcoran and Director AA recused themselves from the\nentirety of the meeting. Without the financial advisors present, Wachtell Lipton reviewed again with the Board its\nfiduciary duties in the context of the contemplated transaction and provided an updated overview of the regulatory\nrisk associated with each remaining bidder. With the presence of all advisors, the Board reviewed, among other\nthings, the status of the strategic process, including a comparison of the revised bids submitted by each bidder and a\ncomparison of the potential benefits of the revised bids in comparison to executing the Company\u2019s standalone\nstrategic plan. Citi and Evercore also reported on their discussion with Bidder A. Copies of the personal notes sent to\nmembers of the Board on December 6 by Mr. Kubasik were shared with the Board. The Board also reviewed a\ncomparison of the terms of the merger agreement submitted in each bidder\u2019s markup of the transaction documents.\nThe Board also discussed the remaining timeline and was advised that continued public speculation and reporting\nabout the process made it prudent to bring the bidding process to a timely resolution while there was substantial\ncompetitive pressure on the remaining bidders. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management and financial\nadvisors advised the Board that the latest proposals from L3Harris and Bidder C reflected attractive valuations for the\nCompany relative to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s historical trading and standalone strategic plan. The Board was also\nadvised that even though both proposals were already favorable in terms of both price and contract provisions\nrelative to the merger agreement in the Lockheed Martin transaction, there was still the potential to further improve\nthem in the final stage of the strategic process. The Board directed members of the Company\u2019s senior management\nand advisors to continue negotiating with L3Harris and Bidder C, with the goal of securing a favorable agreement for\nconsideration for final Board approval over the weekend of December 17 and 18, 2022.\nIn accordance with the Board\u2019s direction, representatives of Citi and Evercore instructed L3Harris and Bidder C\nthat they remained in the process and should work towards finalizing any remaining due diligence requirements, open\ncontract points and the submission of their further revised bids.\nBetween December 10 and December 16, 2022, Wachtell Lipton continued to negotiate the terms of the merger\nagreement with counsel for L3Harris and Bidder C. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management, Citi\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand Evercore continued to engage with L3Harris and Bidder C to answer any remaining diligence questions and\ncoordinate additional site visits as requested by Bidder C. In accordance with the Board\u2019s direction and recognizing\nthat the Board was expected to meet the forthcoming weekend, the representatives of Citi and Evercore informed\nL3Harris and Bidder C that they should expeditiously complete their remaining due diligence and submit their best\nand final bid as soon as possible.\nOn December 15, 2022, the Board met again and, among other things, received an update on the strategic\nprocess. Mr. Corcoran and Director AA recused themselves from the entirety of the meeting. At the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Citi and Evercore provided a brief update on the continued engagement from each of L3Harris and\nBidder C and Wachtell Lipton provided, among other things, an updated summary of the revised terms as negotiated\nwith each party. Wachtell Lipton noted that the Company was close to an agreement on terms with each of L3Harris\nand Bidder C and that the terms provided by L3Harris were generally more favorable for the Company than those\nprovided by Bidder C.\nOn December 16, 2022, L3Harris submitted a final bid with revised drafts of the transaction documents,\nreiterating its previous $57.00 per share all-cash offer. The representatives of Citi and Evercore informed Bidder C that\nanother party had submitted a further revised bid that the Board was prepared to consider and invited Bidder C to\nsubmit its best and final bid. The closing price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock on December 16,\n2022, was $54.89.\nOn December 17, 2022, Bidder C indicated that it was not prepared to increase its price above its previous $52.00\nper share all-cash offer and did not submit revised drafts of the transaction documents.\nBetween December 16 and December 17, 2022, the Company and L3Harris and their respective advisors worked\nto finalize the definitive transaction documents, with all remaining open points having been substantially resolved by\nthe morning of December 17, 2022.\nThe Board met on December 17 to consider the final bids and whether to approve Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s entry\ninto definitive transaction documents providing for, among other things, the merger of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Mr.\nCorcoran and Director AA again recused themselves from the entirety of the meeting. At the meeting, Wachtell\nLipton provided an overview of, among other things, the regulatory risk associated with each of L3Harris and Bidder\nC and summarized their positions on certain closing certainty provisions in the transaction documents, including on\nthe reverse break fee and affirmative covenants on each potential buyer between signing and consummation of the\ntransaction. The Board was also presented with an updated comparison of the merger agreement terms agreed with\nL3Harris to those agreed in the Lockheed Martin transaction.\nWith advice from members of the Company\u2019s senior management and financial advisors, the Board reviewed and\ncompared the final bids from L3Harris and Bidder C, and discussed, among other things, that Bidder C\u2019s final bid was\nsubstantially lower in value. The financial advisors were asked and they each indicated their view that the Company\nhad made an outreach to all logical buyers and, to the extent any potential buyer had been overlooked, the public\nspeculation and reporting about the process and the public awareness of Elliott\u2019s equity stake in the Company since\nAugust 2022 provided ample opportunity for any other interested potential buyer to come forward if they had not\nbeen contacted. The fact that Bidder A had continued to be provided with access to diligence and had been told that\na renewed bid was welcome was also discussed.\nRepresentatives of Citi and Evercore reviewed their preliminary valuation analyses and answered questions from\nthe Board regarding the valuation of Aerojet Rocketdyne represented by the $57.00 per share all-cash offer from\nL3Harris. Wachtell Lipton also discussed with the Board, among other things, its fiduciary duties under Delaware law\nin connection with considering the approval of a potential sale of Aerojet Rocketdyne and also reviewed the\nrespective relationship disclosures from Citi and Evercore. Wachtell Lipton summarized the terms of the Merger\nAgreement, the regulatory clearance process for the proposed transaction and the authorizing resolutions that the\nBoard would approve and answered questions from the Board. The Board discussed with members of the Company\u2019s\nsenior management and the financial and legal advisors their perspectives on the proposed transaction, including\nthat Bidder C had not submitted revised drafts of the transaction documents. The Board also discussed, with input\nfrom its financial and legal advisors, that the proposed Merger with L3Harris was more favorable to the Company in\nterms of price and transactional certainty and protections than the prior merger agreement in the Lockheed Martin\ntransaction, and that the terms presented a favorable price for Company stockholders in comparison to the price at\nwhich the Company\u2019s Common Stock was likely to trade in the absence of a transaction. At the conclusion of the\nmeeting, Ms. Drake recommended to the Board that the\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany proceed to finalize a transaction with L3Harris over the balance of the day and that she be authorized to call\nMr. Kubasik to negotiate a final offer and, among other things, request an increase in the offer price to ensure that the\nBoard had taken all steps reasonable and appropriate to secure for the Company and its stockholders the highest\nprice reasonably achievable from any of the potential buyers in the strategic process. After further discussion, the\nBoard agreed to proceed as recommended by Ms. Drake.\nAfter the meeting, Ms. Drake reached out to Mr. Kubasik to convey Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s position. After such\ndiscussion, Mr. Kubasik agreed to increase the merger consideration to $58.00 per share without any change in the\nother terms of the merger agreement in order to bring finality to the negotiations with L3Harris and other potential\nbuyers. Mr. Kubasik further agreed that a joint press release would be issued to announce the transaction, that\nL3Harris would commit to being diligent in seeking regulatory clearance and that L3Harris would remain a merchant\nsupplier.\nDuring the afternoon of December 17, 2022, the Board met again. Mr. Corcoran and Director AA recused\nthemselves from the entirety of the meeting. The Board again reviewed the summary of proposed terms of the Merger\nAgreement with L3Harris previously considered in the morning meeting. Representatives of Citi reviewed its final\nfinancial analysis of the proposed consideration in the proposed transaction with L3Harris, reflecting the increased\nprice per share of $58.00, as summarized below under \u201c- Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\u201d Representatives\nof Evercore then reviewed its final financial analysis of the proposed consideration in the proposed transaction with\nL3Harris, reflecting the increased price per share of $58.00, as summarized below under \u201c- Opinion of Evercore Group\nL.L.C.\u201d After discussion among the Board, Citi, Evercore and Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore rendered to the\nBoard their respective oral opinions, which were later confirmed by the delivery of Citi\u2019s written opinion, dated\nDecember 17, 2022, and the delivery of Evercore\u2019s written opinion, dated December 17, 2022, to the Board to the effect\nthat, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations and qualifications\nset forth therein, the consideration of $58.00 per share to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed\nMerger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. After additional discussions of the proposed\ntransaction and the matters summarized for the Board at the meeting, the Board (1) approved, adopted and declared\nadvisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, (2) determined that the Merger\nAgreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (3)\ndirected that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for their approval and (4) resolved,\nsubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the Company\u2019s stockholders\napprove the Merger Agreement.\nLater in the evening on December 17, 2022, Aerojet Rocketdyne and L3Harris executed and delivered the Merger\nAgreement.\nOn the afternoon of December 18, 2022, Aerojet Rocketdyne and L3Harris issued a joint press release\nannouncing the transaction.\nReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Aerojet Rocketdyne Board",

the\nTransactions, including the Merger, and, on December 17, 2022, determined that the Merger Agreement and the\nTransactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and approved, adopted and\ndeclared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger.\nIn the course of making the recommendation, the Board considered a range of factors, including those below\n(which are not necessarily in order of relative importance) relating to the Merger Agreement and the Transactions,\nincluding the Merger, each of which the Board believed supported its decision:\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s assessment of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business, assets, current and projected financial\nperformance and condition, earnings, prospects and outlook, including taking into account Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s potential for, and risks and uncertainties to, future growth and value creation\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, which provides the Company\u2019s stockholders immediate\ncertainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Common Stock and enables the Company\u2019s stockholders\nto realize value that has been created at the Company while eliminating long-term business and execution\nrisk\u037e\n36TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of the shares of Common Stock, including the market performance\nof the shares of Common Stock relative to those of other participants in the Company\u2019s industry and\ngeneral market indices and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $58.00 per share represented a\npremium of approximately 37% to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s closing stock price on August 15, 2022 (the last full\nday of unaffected trading of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Common Stock), and reflected an implied transaction\nmultiple within the range of select precedent transaction multiples used in the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisors\u2019 analyses\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s concern regarding the potential impact of any potential economic downturn on the price of\nshares of Common Stock (and on the potential valuation that counterparties would be willing to pay)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe course and history of the negotiations between Aerojet Rocketdyne and L3Harris, as described under\n\u201c- Background of the Merger,\u201d including the fact that the Merger Consideration reflects a substantial\npremium and a favorable valuation relative to various metrics and methodologies and the Board\u2019s belief that\nL3Harris\u2019s offer of $58.00 per share was L3Harris\u2019s best and final offer\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief of the Board that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms for the\nCompany, in the aggregate, to which L3Harris was willing to agree\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that there was a substantial multi-phased, auction-style pre-signing market check that included\nboth strategic and financial bidders, providing confidence that it was unlikely a higher offer price could\nhave been obtained\u037e\n\u2022\nthe high degree of certainty that the closing will be achieved in a timely manner, in view of the terms of the\nMerger Agreement, including, among other things, the provisions and protections increasing the level of\ncertainty afforded to the Merger ultimately being consummated\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the price of $58.00 per share in cash and the terms of the Merger Agreement were both\nsuperior to the offer price and terms of the Lockheed Martin transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nthe opinions of Citi and Evercore rendered to the Board on December 17, 2022, that, as of such date and\nbased upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth therein,\nthe consideration of $58.00 per share to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger was\nfair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, as more fully described in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c- Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\u201d and \u201c- Opinion of Evercore Group\nL.L.C.\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the Merger Agreement be approved by the holders of a majority of all the votes\nentitled to be cast to approve the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which the Board believed are\nreasonable and customary in number and scope\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement minimize, to the extent reasonably\npractical, the risk that a condition to closing would not be satisfied and also provide reasonable\nflexibility to operate Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business during the pendency of the Merger, including as\nto actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the Board, subject to certain conditions, to provide\ninformation to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party that makes a bona fide,\nwritten unsolicited Alternative Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the Board, subject to certain conditions, to withdraw\nor change its recommendation of the Merger Agreement and to terminate the Merger Agreement, in\ncertain circumstances relating to the presence of a Superior Proposal (or to effect a Change of\nRecommendation in response to an Intervening Event) subject, in certain cases, to paying the\nCompany Termination Fee\u037e\n\u2022\nthe absence of a financing condition in the

Aerojet Rocketdyne in the\nMerger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to specifically enforce L3Harris\u2019s obligations under the Merger\nAgreement, including L3Harris\u2019s obligations to complete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the Termination Date, as it may be extended, if applicable, allows for sufficient time to\ncomplete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that L3Harris agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary governmental\napprovals as to the Merger, including agreeing to remedies as necessary to obtain any such approval,\nsubject to certain limitations as to the remedies and actions that L3Harris would be required to take,\nwhich limitations and other relevant provisions are further described under the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Efforts to Complete the Merger\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain\ncircumstances, L3Harris will pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee as more fully described\nunder the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Parent Termination Fee\u201d\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s view that the terms of the Merger Agreement would be unlikely to deter interested third parties\nfrom making a Superior Proposal, including the Merger Agreement\u2019s terms and conditions related to a\nChange of Recommendation, the Company\u2019s right to terminate the Merger Agreement in favor of an\nalternative Superior Proposal if certain provisions were satisfied, the payment by the Company of a\nCompany Termination Fee (the amount of which was on the lower end of the customary range) in\nconnection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, and the Board\u2019s\nbelief that the overall terms relating to the foregoing were appropriate and favorable to the Company and its\nstockholders taking into account the specific circumstances involved (see the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Alternative Proposals\u037e Non-Solicitation\u201d).\nIn addition, the Board also weighed the advantages and benefits against a variety of risks and other potentially\nnegative factors (which are not necessarily in order of relative importance), including the following:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Company\u2019s stockholders generally will have no ongoing equity participation in the\nCompany following the Merger, and that such stockholders will cease to participate in the Company\u2019s\nfuture earnings or growth, if any, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of shares of Common\nStock, and will not participate in any potential future sale of the Company to a third party\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk of incurring substantial expenses related to the Merger, including in connection with any litigation\nthat may result from the announcement or pendency of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to complete the Merger\nwill be satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the Merger may not be completed even if the Merger\nAgreement is approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that certain HSR Act clearance required to consummate the Merger may not be obtained\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u2019s restrictions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business before the completion of\nthe Merger, generally requiring the Company to conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to\nspecific limitations and certain exceptions, which may nevertheless delay or prevent the Company from\npursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and taking other actions as to its business that the\nCompany may consider advantageous pending completion of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and costs to the Company if the Merger does not close, including the diversion of management\nand employee attention, potential effects on the ability to retain employees and the potential effect on\nbusiness and customer and supplier relationships\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock under the Merger will be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe fact that certain of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that\nmay be different from, or in addition to, those of the Company\u2019s stockholders, as further described in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201c- Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe covenants in the Merger Agreement prohibiting the Company from soliciting other potential acquisition\nproposals, and restricting its ability to entertain other potential acquisition proposals, unless certain\nconditions are satisfied\u037e\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the Company pay the Company Termination Fee, under certain circumstances\nfollowing termination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Company terminates the Merger\nAgreement to accept a Superior Proposal, as further described in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Company Termination Fee\u201d\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that the announcement of the Merger Agreement and pendency of the Merger, or the failure to\ncomplete the Merger, may cause substantial harm to the Company\u2019s relationships with its employees\n(including making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key\nmanagement, technical, sales and other personnel), suppliers and customers and may divert employees\u2019\nattention away from the Company\u2019s day-to-day business operations.\nAfter considering the foregoing factors, the Board concluded that, overall, the potentially beneficial factors\nrelating to the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, outweighed the risks and potentially\nnegative factors.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not exhaustive but is\nintended to reflect the material factors considered by the Board in its consideration of the Merger Agreement and the\nTransactions, including the Merger. In view of the complexity and the large number of factors considered, the Board,\nindividually and collectively, did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weight to the various factors. Rather,\nthe Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition,\nindividual members of the Board may have given different weights to different factors.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is forward-looking in nature.\nThis information should be read in light of the factors described under the caption \u201cCautionary Statement\nConcerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE \u201cFOR\u201d THE MERGER PROPOSAL.\nOpinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\nAerojet Rocketdyne retained Citi to provide financial advisory services in connection with a possible\ntransaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne. In connection with Citi\u2019s engagement, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s board of\ndirectors requested that Citi evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Aerojet\nRocketdyne Common Stock of the consideration of $58.00 per share to be received in the proposed Merger by such\nholders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. On December 17,\n2022, at a meeting of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors held to evaluate the proposed Merger, Citi rendered\nto the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written\nopinion, dated December 17, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Citi\u2019s written opinion and based on and subject\nto various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the\nreview undertaken by Citi as set forth in its written opinion, the consideration of $58.00 per share was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock.\nThe full text of Citi\u2019s written opinion, dated December 17, 2022, to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors,\nwhich sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations\nand qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as\nAnnex B and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The summary of Citi\u2019s opinion set forth below is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Citi\u2019s opinion. Citi\u2019s opinion was rendered to the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger and\nwas limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndate of the opinion, to the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock of the consideration of $58.00\nper share. Citi\u2019s opinion did not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the proposed Merger or the\nMerger Agreement. Citi\u2019s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to effect\nthe proposed Merger, the relative merits of the proposed Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies\nthat might have existed for Aerojet Rocketdyne or the effect of any other transaction in which Aerojet Rocketdyne\nmight have engaged. Citi\u2019s opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any\nstockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the proposed Merger.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Citi:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft, dated December 17, 2022, of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nheld discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of Aerojet\nRocketdyne concerning the business, operations and prospects of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u037e\n\u2022\nexamined certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne as\nwell as certain financial forecasts (the \u201cProjections,\u201d as defined and summarized in the section in this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Aerojet Rocketdyne Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation\u201d beginning on page 55) and other information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne which\nwere provided to or discussed with Citi by the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms of the proposed Merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to,\namong other things, current and historical market prices of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock, historical\nand projected earnings and other operating data of Aerojet Rocketdyne, and the capitalization and financial\ncondition of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u037e\n\u2022\nconsidered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other transactions which Citi\nconsidered relevant in evaluating the proposed Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nanalyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses\nof other companies whose operations Citi considered relevant in evaluating those of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nconducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and financial,\neconomic and market criteria as Citi deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.\nIn connection with Citi\u2019s engagement and at the direction of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Citi was requested to\napproach, and Citi held discussions with, third parties to solicit indications of interest in the possible acquisition of\nall or a part of Aerojet Rocketdyne. The issuance of Citi\u2019s opinion was authorized by Citi\u2019s fairness opinion\ncommittee.\nIn rendering its opinion, Citi assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed\nby or discussed with Citi, and upon the assurances of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that they were not\naware of any relevant information that was omitted or that remained undisclosed to Citi. With respect to the\nProjections and other information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne provided to or otherwise reviewed by or\ndiscussed with Citi, Citi was advised by the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that such forecasts and other\ninformation and data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and\njudgments of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne as to the future financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nCiti assumed, with the consent of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, that the proposed Merger would\nbe consummated in accordance with the terms, conditions and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement,\nwithout waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of\nobtaining the necessary regulatory or third-party approvals, consents and releases for the proposed Merger, no\ndelay, limitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Merger\nmeaningful to its opinion and analysis. Representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne advised Citi, and Citi further assumed,\nwith the consent of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, that the final terms of the Merger Agreement would\nnot vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by Citi. Citi did not make and was not provided with an\nindependent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\notherwise) of Aerojet Rocketdyne nor did Citi make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Aerojet\nRocketdyne. Citi\u2019s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to effect the\nproposed Merger, the relative merits of the proposed Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that\nmight have existed for Aerojet Rocketdyne or the effect of any other transaction in which Aerojet Rocketdyne might\nhave engaged. Citi also expressed no view as to, and Citi\u2019s opinion did not address, the fairness (financial or\notherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees\nof any parties to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or\notherwise. Citi\u2019s opinion was necessarily based upon information available to Citi, and financial, stock market and\nother conditions and circumstances existing, as of the date of its opinion. The credit, financial and stock markets, the\nindustries in which Aerojet Rocketdyne operates, and the securities of Aerojet Rocketdyne have experienced and\nmay continue to experience volatility and Citi expressed no view or opinion as to any potential effects of such\nvolatility on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the Merger.\nIn preparing its opinion, Citi performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those\ndescribed below. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various\ndeterminations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those\nmethods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial\nanalysis or summary description. Citi arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and\nfactors assessed as a whole, and it did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or\nmethod of analysis for purposes of its opinion.\nIn its analyses, Citi considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions and other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Aerojet\nRocketdyne. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to Aerojet Rocketdyne\nor the Merger, and an evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical\u037e rather, the analyses involve complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect\nthe public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions reviewed or the results of\nany particular analysis.\nThe estimates used by Citi for purposes of its analyses and the valuation ranges resulting from any particular\nanalysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the\nvalue of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or\nsecurities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Citi\u2019s\nanalyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nCiti was not requested to, and it did not, recommend or determine the specific consideration payable in the\nMerger. The type and amount of consideration payable in the proposed Merger was determined through negotiations\nbetween Aerojet Rocketdyne, on the one hand, and L3Harris and its affiliates, on the other hand, and Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors. Citi\u2019s opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors in its\nevaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors or the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne with respect to the proposed Merger, merger consideration or\nany other aspect of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nFinancial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared for and reviewed with the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors in connection with Citi\u2019s opinion, dated December 17, 2022, to the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial\nanalyses performed by, and underlying the opinion of, Citi, nor does the order of the financial analyses described\nrepresent the relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses by Citi. Certain financial analyses\nsummarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial\nanalyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a\ncomplete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full\nnarrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the\nfinancial analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial analyses. Future results may be\ndifferent from those\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndescribed, and such differences may be material. Approximate implied equity value per share reference ranges\nderived from the financial analyses described below and other per share ranges presented for reference purposes\nonly were rounded to the nearest $0.25, except for data relating to intraday trading share prices. Except as otherwise\nnoted, financial data utilized for Aerojet Rocketdyne in the financial analyses described below were based on the\nProjections and other information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne provided to or discussed with Citi and\napproved for Citi\u2019s use by Aerojet Rocketdyne and as further summarized in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Aerojet Rocketdyne Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d beginning on\npage 55. For purposes of the financial analyses described below, the term \u201cEBITDA,\u201d when used with respect to any\ncompany, other than Aerojet Rocketdyne, generally refers to that company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization expenses\u037e the term \u201cadjusted EBITDA,\u201d when used with respect to Aerojet\nRocketdyne, generally refers to EBITDA excluding EBITDA attributable to its real estate segment and\nincome/(expense) related to re-measurement of net environmental remediation asset/liability.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nCiti conducted a discounted cash flow analysis of Aerojet Rocketdyne using the Projections. Based on the\nProjections, Citi calculated a range of present values (as of September 30, 2022) of the estimated unlevered after-tax\nfree cash flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was forecasted to generate under the Projections during the fourth quarter\nof the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 through the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2031 (such cash flows\nreferred to as the \u201cprojected cash flows\u201d). For purposes of this analysis, the projected cash flows provided by\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management were adjusted with management\u2019s approval to exclude the impact of cash pension\ncontributions and reimbursements, net environmental remediation cash flows and real estate cash flows (collectively,\nthe \u201cadditional cash flow items\u201d). The additional cash flow items were excluded from the projected cash flows on the\nbasis that they are significant items that Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management believes are non-perpetual. The impact of\neach of the cash pension contributions and reimbursements and net environmental cash flows were reflected as a\nliability on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s balance sheet, and real estate cash flows were reflected as assets. For purposes of\nthis analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Citi also calculated a range of estimated\nterminal values for Aerojet Rocketdyne by applying an illustrative range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0%\nto Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated terminal year unlevered after-tax free cash flows (excluding the additional cash\nflow items). The illustrative range of perpetuity growth rates applied was selected by Citi based on its professional\njudgment and experience. The range of estimated terminal values for Aerojet Rocketdyne was then discounted to\npresent values (as of September 30, 2022) and added to the estimated present values of the projected cash flows in\norder to derive ranges of implied adjusted firm values for Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nIn calculating the ranges of implied adjusted firm values for Aerojet Rocketdyne, Citi discounted the projected\ncash flows and estimated terminal values using discount rates ranging from 9.2% to 10.1%. Citi derived this range of\ndiscount rates based on a calculation of the weighted average cost of capital of Aerojet Rocketdyne it performed\nutilizing the capital asset pricing model with inputs that Citi determined were relevant based on publicly available data\nand Citi\u2019s professional judgment. From the range of implied adjusted firm values it derived, Citi subtracted Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s reported net debt and other as of September 30, 2022 (calculated as debt, plus the tax-effected net\npresent value of net Cost Accounting Standards (\u201cCAS\u201d) reimbursements and cash pension contributions/other\npost-employment benefits (\u201cOPEB\u201d) payments and net cash settlement of stock appreciation rights, less cash, cash\nequivalents, reported value of real estate assets held for entitlement and leasing and reported tax effected net\nenvironmental asset/(liability)), and divided the results by the number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common\nStock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury share method, based on information\nprovided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management. The net present value of net CAS reimbursements and cash pension\ncontributions/OPEB payments was calculated by discounting CAS reimbursements and cash pension\ncontributions/OPEB payments reflected in the Projections using, at the direction of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nmanagement, a 5.4% after tax cost of debt and 0% perpetuity growth rate. This analysis indicated the following\napproximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Aerojet Rocketdyne (rounded to the nearest $0.25),\nas compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share:\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n \nImplied per Share \nEquity Value Reference Range\n \n \n$48.50 - $60.25\n \nPresent Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nCiti performed an analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne\nCommon Stock as of December 16, 2022 based on theoretical future prices calculated by Citi for the shares of Aerojet\nRocketdyne Common Stock under the Projections. Citi derived a range of theoretical future values per share for the\nshares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock as of December 31 of each of 2023, 2024 and 2025. Based on the\nProjections, Citi derived this range of theoretical future values per share by (i) applying illustrative one year forward\nadjusted firm value to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined, and as calculated as described, in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Aerojet Rocketdyne Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d)\nmultiples of 9.6x to 11.6x to estimates of the Adjusted EBITDA of Aerojet Rocketdyne for each of calendar years 2024,\n2025 and 2026, as reflected in the Projections, (ii) adjusting the resulting range of firm values to a range of equity\nvalues by subtracting Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated net debt and other for each period ending as of December 31\n(calculated as estimated debt, plus estimated tax effected unfunded pension/OPEB liability and net cash settlement of\nstock appreciation rights, less estimated cash, cash equivalents, estimated value of real estate assets held for\nentitlement and leasing and estimated tax effected net environmental asset/(liability)), and (iii) dividing the resulting\nrange of equity values by the number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted\nbasis, calculated using the treasury share method, based on information provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nmanagement. The firm value to Adjusted EBITDA multiples used by Citi were derived based on Citi\u2019s professional\njudgment and experience and taking into account historical firm value to Adjusted EBITDA multiples of Aerojet\nRocketdyne during the period from December 19, 2017 through December 18, 2020, the last full trading day prior to\nannouncement of the proposed merger of Aerojet Rocketdyne with affiliates of Lockheed Martin Corporation. By\napplying a discount rate of 9.9%, reflecting a mid-point estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s cost of equity, Citi\ndiscounted to present value as of December 16, 2022 the theoretical future values per share it derived for Aerojet\nRocketdyne, to yield a range of illustrative present values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock. This\nanalysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Aerojet Rocketdyne\n(rounded to the nearest $0.25), as compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share:\n \n \nImplied per Share \nEquity Value Reference Range\n \n \n$43.25 - $58.75\n \nSelected Public Companies Analysis\nCiti reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne and the thirteen\npublicly traded companies listed below whose operations, for the purposes of Citi\u2019s analysis and based on its\nexperience and professional judgment, Citi considered generally relevant in evaluating those of Aerojet Rocketdyne,\nbased on business sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics (such companies collectively,\nthe \u201cselected companies\u201d).\nFor the selected companies, Citi calculated and reviewed, among other information, firm values (calculated as\nfully diluted market equity value, plus net debt, preferred equity and non-controlling interests, tax effected unfunded\npension liabilities and less unconsolidated investments and non-operating assets, as applicable) as multiples of\nestimated calendar year 2023 EBITDA. All calculations in this review were based on closing share prices on\nDecember 16, 2022 and, with respect to the selected companies, financial data (pro forma as applicable) were based on\npublicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019 estimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Citi\nalso calculated and reviewed the firm value of Aerojet Rocketdyne as a multiple of its estimated Adjusted EBITDA of\nAerojet Rocketdyne for calendar year 2023, based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019 estimates, as\nwell as based on the Projections. The estimated calendar year 2023 EBITDA multiples observed for the selected\ncompanies and for Aerojet Rocketdyne were as follows:\nSelected Company\nFirm Value / 2023E\nEBITDA\nAeroVironment, Inc.\n22.9x\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.\n21.2x\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Company\nFirm Value / 2023E\nEBITDA\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation\n18.4x\nMercury Systems, Inc.\n16.5x\nLockheed Martin Corporation\n14.3x\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation\n14.1x\nElbit Systems Ltd.\n13.5x\nL3Harris Technologies, Inc.\n13.1x\nCACI International Inc.\n12.0x\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.\n11.8x\nAvio S.p.A.\n10.8x\nChemring Group PLC\n10.3x\nOHB SE\n8.9x\nLow\n8.9x\nMedian\n13.5x\nHigh\n22.9x\n \n \nAerojet Rocketdyne (For Reference)\nFirm Value / 2023E Adj.\nEBITDA\nAerojet Rocketdyne (Wall Street Research)\n13.6x\nAerojet Rocketdyne (Wall Street Research - unaffected trading price as of August\n15, 2022)\n10.7x\nAerojet Rocketdyne (Projections)\n12.3x\nBased on the multiples calculated and observed for the selected companies as described above and its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Citi identified and applied a selected illustrative range of firm value to calendar\nyear 2023 EBITDA multiples of 8.9x to 13.5x to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated calendar year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA,\nreflected in the Projections, to derive a range of implied adjusted firm values for Aerojet Rocketdyne. From the range\nof implied adjusted firm values it derived, Citi subtracted Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s reported net debt and other as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 (calculated as debt, plus tax effected reported unfunded pension/OPEB liability and net cash\nsettlement of stock appreciation rights, less cash, cash equivalents, reported value of real estate assets held for\nentitlement and leasing and reported tax effected net environmental asset/(liability)) and divided the results by the\nnumber of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the\ntreasury share method, based on information provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management.

The\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\norder of the analyses described and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight\ngiven to these analyses by Evercore. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent\nthat it is based on market data, is based on market data that existed on or before December 16, 2022 (the last full\ntrading date prior to the rendering of Evercore\u2019s opinion), and is not necessarily indicative of current market\nconditions.\nFor purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions, industry sector performance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of\nits opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Aerojet Rocketdyne. The estimates contained in Evercore\u2019s\nanalyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or\nless favorable than those suggested by Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating\nto the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which\ncompanies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived\nfrom, Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nFor purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of\nthe financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available\nto, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent verification of such information (and Evercore\nhas not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and Evercore further\nrelied upon the assurances of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that they were not aware of any facts or\ncircumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Projections, Evercore\nassumed with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s consent that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of Aerojet Rocketdyne as to the future\nfinancial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne and the other matters covered thereby. Evercore expressed no view as\nto the Projections or the assumptions on which they were based.\nFor purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the final\nexecuted agreement would not differ from the draft of the Merger Agreement reviewed by Evercore, that the\nrepresentations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party\nwill perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that\nall conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. Evercore\nfurther assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals\nor releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or\ncondition that would have an adverse effect on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the consummation of the Merger or reduce\nthe contemplated benefits to the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock of the Merger.\nEvercore did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Aerojet Rocketdyne and did not\nmake or assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities\n(including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor was\nEvercore furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor has Evercore evaluated the solvency or fair value of\nAerojet Rocketdyne under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore\u2019s\nopinion is necessarily based upon information made available to Evercore as of the date of its opinion and financial,\neconomic, market and other conditions as they existed and as could be evaluated on the date of its opinion. It is\nunderstood that subsequent developments may affect Evercore\u2019s opinion and that Evercore does not have any\nobligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.\nEvercore was not asked to pass upon, and Evercore expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than\nthe fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common\nStock. Evercore did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, the fairness of the proposed\ntransaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of\nsecurities, creditors or other constituencies of Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of\nany compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Aerojet Rocketdyne, or any\nclass of such persons, whether relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Evercore was not asked to, nor did\nEvercore express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or\nthe Merger, including, without limitation, the structure or form of the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other\nagreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nentered into or amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Evercore\u2019s opinion does not address the relative\nmerits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to Aerojet\nRocketdyne, nor does it address the underlying business decision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to engage in the Merger.\nEvercore\u2019s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Board or to any other persons in respect of the\nMerger, including as to how any holder of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock should vote or act in respect\nof the Merger. Evercore was not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne\nCommon Stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets\non Aerojet Rocketdyne or the Merger or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of Aerojet\nRocketdyne or the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to pay its obligations when they come due. Evercore is not a legal,\nregulatory, accounting or tax expert and has assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by Aerojet\nRocketdyne and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.\nThe following summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In\norder to fully understand the analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The\ntables are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of Evercore\u2019s financial\nanalyses. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore\u2019s financial\nanalyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of such analyses. \nSummary of Evercore\u2019s Financial Analyses\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nEvercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aerojet Rocketdyne to calculate the estimated present\nvalue of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was forecasted to generate\nduring Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s fiscal years 2023 through 2031 based on the Projections. For purposes of this analysis,\nthe projected cash flows provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management were adjusted with management\u2019s approval\nto exclude the impact of cash pension contributions net of reimbursements, net environmental remediation cash flows\nand real estate cash flows (collectively, the \u201cadditional cash flow items\u201d). The additional cash flow items were\nexcluded from the projected cash flows on the basis that they are significant items that Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nmanagement believes are non-perpetual. The impact of cash pension contributions net of reimbursements and net\nenvironmental remediation cash flows were reflected as liabilities on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s balance sheet, and the real\nestate cash flows were reflected as an asset. Evercore calculated terminal values for Aerojet Rocketdyne by applying\nperpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0%, which range was selected based on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and\nexperience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was\nforecasted to generate based on the Projections. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then\ndiscounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 8.75% to 9.75%, which were\nbased on an estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, and the mid-year cash flow\ndiscounting convention. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s total debt (net of\nunamortized deferred financing costs), cash and marketable securities (excluding restricted cash and adjusted for\nstock appreciation rights exercised through December 15, 2022, and for cash settlement of outstanding stock\nappreciation rights as of December 15, 2022, per Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management) and net environmental\nremediation liability position resulting from government and other reimbursements, in each case, as of September 30,\n2022, as reported in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s financial statements, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s present value of forecast cash\ncontributions to fund pension liabilities, net of federal government reimbursement for certain pension expenses, for\nfiscal years 2023 through 2031, as reflected in the Projections, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s value of real estate held for\nentitlement and leasing as of September 30, 2022 as reflected in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s financial statements, and the\nnumber of fully diluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nmanagement, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock\nrounded to the nearest $0.25 of $51.00 to $65.50, as compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share of Aerojet\nRocketdyne Common Stock.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Public Company Trading Analysis\nEvercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of Aerojet Rocketdyne to corresponding financial\nmultiples and ratios for the following selected publicly traded companies in the defense industry (the \u201cselected\ncompanies\u201d) which Evercore deemed most relevant to consider in relation to Aerojet Rocketdyne, based on its\nprofessional judgment and experience, because they are public companies with operations that, for purposes of its\nanalysis, Evercore considered similar to the operations of Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nFor each of the selected companies, Evercore calculated, based on closing share prices as of December 16, 2022,\nenterprise value (defined as equity market capitalization plus total debt, plus after-tax unfunded pension and other\npost-employment benefits (\u201cOPEB\u201d) obligations as of December 31, 2021, plus minority interest, less cash and cash\nequivalents and investments in unconsolidated affiliates, all as of latest available publicly filed balance sheets unless\notherwise noted) as a multiple of estimated 2023 Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Aerojet Rocketdyne Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,\u201d provided that\nwhen used with respect to companies other than Aerojet Rocketdyne, no adjustments attributable to the Aerojet\nRocketdyne real estate segment and income/(expense) related to re-measurement of net environmental remediation\nliability are included in such definition), which we refer to as \u201c2023E Adjusted EBITDA\u201d. Estimated financial data of\nthe selected companies (pro forma as applicable) were based on publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\n \nEV/2023E\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation\n18.4x\nLockheed Martin Corporation\n14.3x\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation\n14.1x\nRaytheon Technologies Corporation\n14.0x\nL3Harris Technologies, Inc.\n13.0x\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.\n11.9x\nThales SA\n8.4x\nMedian\n14.0x\nBased on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and\nexperience, Evercore selected a reference range of enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 9.5x - 11.5x and\napplied this range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA based on the\nProjections.\nBased on these ranges of implied enterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s total debt (net of unamortized\ndeferred financing costs), cash and marketable securities (excluding restricted cash and adjusted for stock\nappreciation rights exercised through December 15, 2022, and for cash settlement of outstanding stock appreciation\nrights as of December 15, 2022, per Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management), and net environmental liability position\nresulting from government and other reimbursements, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB\nliabilities as of December 31, 2021, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s value of real estate held for entitlement and leasing as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, in each case, as reported in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s financial statements, and the number of fully\ndiluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock, in each case as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nmanagement, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock\nrounded to the nearest $0.25 of $44.50 to $53.50, compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share of Aerojet\nRocketdyne Common Stock.\nAlthough none of the selected companies are directly comparable to Aerojet Rocketdyne, Evercore selected\nthese companies because they are publicly traded defense companies that Evercore, in its professional judgment and\nexperience, considered generally relevant to Aerojet Rocketdyne for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating\nthe selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and\nmarket conditions affecting the selected companies and other matters, as well as differences in the selected\ncompanies\u2019 financial, business and operating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this\nanalysis is not entirely mathematical.

Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful\nmethod of using the data of the selected companies.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nEvercore reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information related to the following selected\ntransactions involving target companies in the defense and aerospace industries announced since 2015 (the\n\u201cselected transactions\u201d). For each selected transaction, Evercore calculated the implied enterprise value (defined as\nthe target company\u2019s implied equity value based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total\ndebt, plus minority interest and after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities (post-Financial Accounting\nStandards Board Accounting Standards Update 2017-07 effective date, if relevant), less cash and cash equivalents\nand net of acquired tax benefits, if relevant) as a multiple of last twelve-month (LTM) Adjusted EBITDA for the target\ncompany at the time of the announcement of the applicable transaction, which we refer to as \u201cLTM Adjusted\nEBITDA.\u201d Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the\ntime of announcement of the relevant transaction.

Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not\nentirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors\nthat could affect the relative values of the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions and the\nmultiples derived from the selected transactions. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is\nnot in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the selected transactions.\nOther Factors\nEvercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with\nrespect to its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the\nfollowing:\nIllustrative Sponsor Ability to Pay Analysis\nEvercore performed an illustrative sponsor ability to pay analysis to determine the range of price per share of\nAerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock at which a financial sponsor might effect a leveraged buyout of Aerojet\nRocketdyne based on the Projections. For purposes of its analysis, Evercore assumed a required internal rate of\nreturn in the range of 17.5% to 22.5%, a range of total leverage ratios of 5.0x to 5.5x to the Company\u2019s estimated LTM\nAdjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2022, and an applied exit multiple of 12.7x to the Company\u2019s estimated 2027\nLTM Adjusted EBITDA, in each case based on the Projections. Evercore selected the internal rates of return,\nleverage ratios and exit multiples based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience. This\nanalysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock rounded to the\nnearest $0.25 of $45.50 to $52.00, compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common\nStock.\nHistorical Trading Range\nEvercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock during the period\nbeginning on February 13, 2022, the date of termination of the proposed merger of Aerojet Rocketdyne with affiliates\nof Lockheed Martin Corporation, and ended December 16, 2022, noting that the low and high closing prices during\nsuch period ranged from $36.59 to $54.89 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock.\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets\nEvercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common\nStock prepared and published by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of (i) December 16, 2022, the\nlast full trading day prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the Board, and (ii) August 15, 2022, the last full\nday of unaffected trading of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Common Stock. These price\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntargets reflect analysts\u2019 estimates of the future public market trading price of the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne\nCommon Stock at the time the price target was published. The range of selected equity research analyst price targets\nper share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock was $45.00 to $62.00 as of December 16, 2022, the last full trading\nday prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the Board, and $37.00 to $50.00 as of August 15, 2022, the last\nfull day of unaffected trading of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Common Stock. Public market trading price targets published\nby equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares of Aerojet\nRocketdyne Common Stock and these target prices and the analysts\u2019 earnings estimates on which they were based\nare subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors affecting the financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne and\nfuture general industry and market conditions.\nPremiums Paid Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, Evercore reviewed 29 all-cash transactions and announced bids for control\nof U.S. public targets by strategic acquirors with an aggregate transaction value between $2 billion and $6 billion\nannounced since January 1, 2017 (excluding financial, REIT, master limited partnership and pharmaceutical targets,\nmergers of equals, acquisitions by financial sponsors, and transactions between related parties). Using publicly\navailable information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which the per share consideration\npaid or proposed to be paid in each such transaction exceeded the closing market prices per share of the target\ncompanies one day prior to announcement of each transaction.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\n \n1 Day\nPrior\n25th Percentile\n26.3%\nMedian\n36.9%\nMean\n38.3%\n75th Percentile\n51.6%\nBased on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a premium\nrange of 25% to 50% to $42.49, the closing market price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock on August\n15, 2022, representing the last full day of unaffected trading of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Common Stock. This analysis\nindicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock rounded to the nearest\n$0.25 of $53.00 to $63.75, compared to the merger consideration of $58.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common\nStock.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price\nEvercore performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per share of Aerojet\nRocketdyne Common Stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future\nvalue of a company\u2019s equity as a function of that company\u2019s next twelve month Adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to\nas \u201cNTM Adjusted EBITDA,\u201d and an assumed enterprise value to NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiple.\nIn calculating the implied present value of the future price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock,\nEvercore first calculated the implied future enterprise value of the Company by multiplying the Company\u2019s estimated\nNTM Adjusted EBITDA as of the end of each of calendar years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, based on the Projections,\nby an illustrative enterprise value to NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiple range of 9.7x to 11.7x, which was selected\nbased on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to derive an implied future enterprise value reference\nrange for Aerojet Rocketdyne. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s total debt (net\nof unamortized deferred financing costs) as of the end of the applicable year, cash and marketable securities\n(excluding restricted cash and adjusted for stock appreciation rights exercised through December 15, 2022, and for\ncash settlement of outstanding stock appreciation rights as of December 15, 2022, per Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nmanagement) as of the end of the applicable year and net environmental liability position resulting from government\nand other reimbursements as of the end of the applicable year, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s after-tax unfunded pension and\nOPEB liabilities as of as of the end of the applicable year, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s value of real estate held for\nentitlement and leasing as of as of the end of the applicable year, in each case, as based on the Projections, Evercore\ncalculated a reference range of implied future equity values for Aerojet Rocketdyne. Evercore then divided the\nimplied future equity values of Aerojet\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRocketdyne for each such year by the number of estimated fully diluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common\nStock outstanding for such year, as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management, to calculate a reference range of\nimplied future equity values per share for the Company. Evercore then discounted the implied share prices back to\nDecember 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 10.0%, which were based on an estimate of Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s cost of equity. This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet\nRocketdyne Common Stock rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $43.25 to $60.75, compared to the merger consideration of\n$58.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the\nanalyses or data presented by Evercore to the Board. In connection with the review of the Merger by Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s board of directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of\nrendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to\npartial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above,\nwithout considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore\u2019s\nopinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of all the analyses and did not draw,\nin isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its\nopinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and\nexperience after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses\nand factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or\nless probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or\ncombination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual\nvalue of the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section\nnot equaling the total of the figures shown.\nEvercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Board as to the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, of the consideration of $58.00 per share to the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne\nCommon Stock. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the\nbusiness or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative\nof actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nAccordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore\u2019s analyses are inherently subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those\nforecasted in such estimates.\nEvercore\u2019s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Board\n(in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of Evercore\u2019s\nopinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.\nEvercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Board or Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nmanagement or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the\nMerger for the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock.\nPursuant to the terms of Evercore\u2019s engagement letter with Aerojet Rocketdyne, Aerojet Rocketdyne has agreed\nto pay Evercore a fee for its services in the amount of approximately $35.8 million, of which $2.5 million was paid upon\ndelivery of Evercore\u2019s opinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the consummation of the\nMerger. Aerojet Rocketdyne has also agreed to reimburse Evercore for certain expenses and to indemnify Evercore\nagainst certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.\nDuring the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have provided financial\nadvisory services to Aerojet Rocketdyne and received fees for the rendering of these services. During the two-year\nperiod prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory\nor other services to L3Harris and Evercore has not received any compensation from L3Harris during such period.\nEvercore may provide financial advisory or other services to Aerojet Rocketdyne and L3Harris in the future, and in\nconnection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.\nEvercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of\ncustomers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity,\nplacement agent, asset management and related activities.

            "text": "Certain Aerojet Rocketdyne Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nWhile Aerojet Rocketdyne has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, Aerojet\nRocketdyne has not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections by year as to future\nperformance, earnings or other results beyond the then current annual period, and is especially wary of making\nprojections for extended periods, due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting\nfinancial performance for future periods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However,\nAerojet Rocketdyne is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective financial\ninformation of Aerojet Rocketdyne on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Merger (the \u201cProjections\u201d),\nprepared by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management, solely because such financial information was given to the Aerojet\nRocketdyne Board and Citi and Evercore as described below. Aerojet Rocketdyne advised the recipients of the\nProjections that its internal financial forecasts are subjective in many respects, and the inclusion of the Projections in\nthis proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication of future results or an accurate prediction of future\nresults, and should not be relied on as such.\nThe Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view\ntoward compliance with published guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\nfor preparation and presentations of financial projections. This information is prospective and should not be relied\nupon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place\nundue reliance on the Projections. The Projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the\nCompany\u2019s management. Neither the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any independent\naccountants, have examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections and, accordingly,\nthe Company\u2019s independent registered accounting firm does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance\non the Projections or their achievability, and assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association with, the\nProjections. Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report, contained in the\nCompany\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which is incorporated by\nreference into this proxy statement, relates to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s historical financial information and does not\nextend to the Projections and should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account any\ncircumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared.\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the Projections reflect numerous assumptions with respect to\ncompany performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions\nand other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive\nuncertainties and beyond Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s control. Multiple factors, including those described in the section\n\u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d could cause the Projections or the underlying\nassumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Projections,\nand accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s stockholders are urged to review Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a description of the\nreported and anticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital resources, including in\n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and any subsequent quarterly reports on\nForm 10-Q, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.\nThe inclusion of a summary of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication\nthat any of Aerojet Rocketdyne, L3Harris or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or\n55TABLE OF CONTENTS\nother representatives considered the Projections to necessarily be predictive of actual future events, and the\nProjections should not be relied upon as such nor should the information contained in the Projections be considered\nappropriate for other purposes.

The Projections also do not take into\naccount any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared and do not give effect to\nthe Transactions, including the Merger, and also do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Merger to be\ncompleted. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a\nresult, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Projections. Accordingly, there can be no\nassurance that the Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly lower than projected.\nThe inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of\nAerojet Rocketdyne or its affiliates, advisors or representatives considered the Projections to be predictive of\nactual future events, and the Projections should not be relied on as such. None of Aerojet Rocketdyne or its\naffiliates, advisors, officers, employees, directors or representatives can give you any assurance that actual results\nwill not differ from the Projections, and none of those persons undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise\nrevise or reconcile the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Projections were prepared\nor to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the\nProjections are shown to be in error.

For the reasons described above, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any,\nreliance on the Projections.\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInterests of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nWhen considering the recommendation of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Board that you vote to approve the proposal\nto adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and executive officers may\nhave interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally, as more\nfully described below. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) approving the Merger Agreement\nand the Merger\u037e and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby be\nadopted by stockholders, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other\nmatters.\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits\ndescribed in this section, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nthe relevant price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock is $58.00, which is the per share merger\nconsideration \u037e\n\u2022\nthe effective time as referenced in this section occurs on January 23, 2023, which is the assumed date of the\neffective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe employment of each executive officer of Aerojet Rocketdyne was terminated by the surviving\ncorporation without cause or due to the executive officer\u2019s resignation for good reason (as such terms are\ndefined in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on the\nassumed date of the effective time of January 23, 2023.\nThe amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur\nor be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain\ncompensation actions that may occur before completion of the Merger.\nTreatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\nThe Merger Agreement provides for the treatment set forth below as to the awards held by Aerojet Rocketdyne\ndirectors and executive officers at the Effective Time of the Merger.\nRestricted Stock\nAt the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested Aerojet Rocketdyne Restricted Stock Award will automatically\n(i) vest and be canceled and (ii) be converted into the right to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an\namount in cash equal to the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by the total number of shares subject to such\nRestricted Stock Award, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such Restricted Stock\nAward. The total number of shares subject to a performance-based Restricted Stock Award will be based on deemed\nachievement of maximum performance.\nAs of January 23, 2023, the Company\u2019s executive officers held an aggregate of 458,868 shares of Common Stock\nsubject to unvested Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards (all of which RSU Awards are Pre-Signing RSUs\nAwards (as defined below)), and the Company\u2019s non-employee directors held an aggregate of 24,925 shares of\nCommon Stock subject to unvested Restricted Stock Awards.\nSARs\nAt the Effective Time, each outstanding SAR with respect to shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock will\nbe canceled and converted into the right to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal\nto the product of (i) the total number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock subject to such SAR multiplied\nby (ii) the excess, if any, of the Price Per Share over the per share base price of such SAR. Each outstanding SAR with\nrespect to which the per share base price equals or exceeds the Price Per Share will be canceled for no consideration\nat the Effective Time.\nAs of January 23, 2023, the Company\u2019s executive officers held an aggregate of 211,577 SARs, and the\nCompany\u2019s non-employee directors did not hold any SARs.\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRSU Awards\nAt the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested Aerojet Rocketdyne RSU Award granted before the execution\nof the Merger Agreement will automatically (i) vest and be canceled and (ii) be converted into the right to receive\n(subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by\nthe total number of shares subject to such vested RSU Award, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends\ncorresponding to such vested RSU Award. The total number of shares subject to a performance-based RSU Award\nwill be based on deemed achievement of maximum performance.\nAt the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested Post-Signing RSU Award, excluding any such award granted\nto a non-employee director, will be canceled. With respect to each canceled Post-Signing RSU Award:\n\u2022\nfor each former Post-Signing RSU Award holder who remains employed with L3Harris or its subsidiaries as\nof the L3Harris RSU Award grant date (which grant date will be within 30 days of the closing date), L3Harris\nwill grant a L3Harris RSU Award with respect to a number of shares of L3Harris common stock, rounded up\nto the nearest whole number equal to the product of the total number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne\nCommon Stock subject to such canceled Post-Signing RSU Award multiplied by the Equity Award\nExchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement), where (x) such L3Harris RSU Award will vest\n\u2022\non the same vesting schedule as the canceled Post-Signing RSU Award, based on continued\nservice following the Effective Time through each applicable vesting date, and\n\u2022\nupon an earlier termination of employment or service by L3Harris or its affiliates without cause or,\nsolely with respect to any member of the Executive Leadership Team, an earlier resignation for\ngood reason, and\n(y)\nsuch L3Harris RSU Award will otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and\nconditions as applied to the corresponding Post-Signing RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective\nTime, or\n\u2022\nfor each former Post-Signing RSU Award holder who is employed by Aerojet Rocketdyne as of immediately\nprior to the Effective Time and who does not remain employed with L3Harris and its subsidiaries as of the\nL3Harris RSU Award grant date, such former holder will be entitled to receive (subject to any applicable\nwithholdings), an amount in cash equal to the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by the total number\nof shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock subject to such canceled Post-Signing RSU Award,\ntogether with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such Post-Signing RSU Award.\nQuantification of Payments\nFor an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s named executive officers\nin respect of their unvested equity awards, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d below.

This discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders other\nthan U.S. holders. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(referred to as the \u201cCode\u201d), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial opinions and\nadministrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (referred to as the \u201cIRS\u201d), each as in\neffect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a\nretroactive basis, and any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions\nset forth in this discussion. This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a\ncomplete analysis of all potential tax consequences. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising\nunder the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act\nof 2010 or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated\nthereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith), nor does it\naddress any considerations under state, local or foreign tax laws or U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining\nto U.S. federal income tax. This discussion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and, therefore, the conclusions set\nforth in this discussion could be subject to challenge, which challenge could be sustained. No ruling has been or will\nbe sought from the IRS with respect to the Merger.\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Common Stock that, for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:\n\u2022\na citizen or resident individual of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity or arrangement treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\ncreated or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\na trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust\u2019s\nadministration, and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust,\nor (ii) such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a\nU.S. person\u037e or\n\u2022\nan estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nThis discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of Common Stock who hold such shares as capital assets\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion\ndoes not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light\nof its particular circumstances, or that may apply to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal\nincome tax laws (including, for example, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies,\ntraders in securities who elect to apply the mark-to-market method of accounting, U.S. holders subject to any\nalternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt\norganizations, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, tax-qualified retirement plans or other tax-deferred\naccounts, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain former citizens or former long-term residents of\nthe United States, partnerships (or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes), S corporations or other pass-through entities or investors in such partnerships or other pass-through\nentities, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, U.S. holders who hold shares of Common\nStock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, U.S. holders required\nto accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an\napplicable financial statement, and U.S. holders who acquired their shares of Common Stock through the exercise of\nemployee stock options or other compensation arrangements).\nIf a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) holds shares of Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally\ndepend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, a partner in a partnership holding shares of Common Stock, you should consult your tax advisor.\nThis discussion of material U.S. federal tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not\ntax advice. Holders of Common Stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax\nconsequences to them of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of any alternative minimum tax, the\nunearned income Medicare contribution tax and any other U.S. federal, state, local, foreign income or other tax\nlaws.\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder\nwho receives cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an\namount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received and (ii) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in its shares of Common Stock surrendered in exchange. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in shares of\nCommon Stock will generally equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for such shares.\nAny such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if\na U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of Common Stock surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year as\nof the date of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are\ngenerally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to\nlimitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Common Stock at different times or different prices, such U.S.\nholder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately as to each block of Common Stock.\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject, under certain\ncircumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup\nwithholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the\napplicable withholding agent a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury\nthat such U.S. holder is a \u201cUnited States person\u201d (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer identification\nnumber provided is correct and that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be\nrefunded by the IRS or credited against a U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such U.S.\nholder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.\nRegulatory Approvals\nAntitrust Clearance. Under the HSR Act and related rules and regulations, certain transactions, including the\nMerger, may not be completed until certain waiting period requirements have expired or been terminated. The HSR\nAct requires that each party must file a pre-merger notification with the Antitrust Division of the United States\nDepartment of Justice (the \u201cAntitrust Division\u201d) and the FTC. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be\ncompleted until the expiration of a 30-calendar waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their respective HSR Act\nnotification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. In certain circumstances the review period may be\nextended by either the parties or the Antitrust Division or FTC. Completion of the Merger is conditioned on the\nexpiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. The Company and L3Harris filed\ntheir respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on January 10, 2023. L3Harris,\nin consultation with the Company, withdrew its previous Notification and Report Form on February 9, 2023. L3Harris\nresubmitted its Notification and Report Form on February 13, 2023. The applicable waiting period will expire on March\n15, 2023, unless extended or terminated earlier.\nAt any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust\nDivision or the FTC may take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the\nMerger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally permit completion of the Merger subject to regulatory conditions or\nother remedies. In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the\nantitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to\nenjoin the completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may\nalso seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a\nchallenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be\nsuccessful.\nCommitments to Obtain Antitrust Approval. The Company, L3Harris, and Merger Sub are each required to, and\nto cause their respective affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions,\nand to do promptly, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to\nconsummate and make effective the Transactions prior to the Termination Date, subject to certain limitations as to the\nremedies and actions that L3Harris would be required to take, which limitations and other relevant provisions are\nfurther described under the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Efforts to Complete the\nMerger.\u201d \nFiling Fees. L3Harris has agreed to bear the cost of all filing fees payable to any governmental authority in\nconnection with any filings made to obtain regulatory approval.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger",

            "text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS\nIf the Merger is completed, stockholders who have complied exactly with the procedures set forth in Section 262\nof the DGCL, including stockholders who: (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby\u037e (ii) continuously hold their shares of our Common Stock through the Effective\nTime of the Merger\u037e and (iii) properly demand appraisal of their shares of Common Stock in compliance with the\nrequirements of Section 262 are entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Section 262\nand is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and\nincorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice and does not\nconstitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of\nrecord of shares of Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in such holder\u2019s\nname. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Common Stock held of record in the name of another person,\nsuch as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized\nbelow properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through a\nbank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker\nor the other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, holders of shares of Common Stock who: (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby\u037e (ii) continuously hold their shares of Common Stock\nthrough the Effective Time of the Merger\u037e and (iii) otherwise follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262,\nwill be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of\nthe \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines\notherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the\nEffective Time of the Merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days before the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to exercise\nappraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy\nstatement constitutes Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection\nwith the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with\nthe Merger, any holder of shares of Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve\nsuch holder\u2019s right to do so should review Annex D carefully.\nFailure to comply exactly with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in\nthe loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. \nA stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration\ndescribed in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to\nseek appraisal of shares of common stock, Aerojet Rocketdyne believes that if a stockholder considers exercising\nsuch rights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must, among\nother requirements, do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Aerojet Rocketdyne a written demand for appraisal that complies with\nSection 262 before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Common Stock through the Effective Time of the\nMerger.\n90TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must also file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery\nrequesting a determination of the fair value of the shares of Common Stock within 120 days after the Effective Time of\nthe Merger. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger\nAgreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, abstain or not vote its shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Aerojet Rocketdyne,\nbefore the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, at the Special\nMeeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be\nsubmitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares, and that stockholder\nmust not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby. A holder of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date\nthe written demand for appraisal is made, and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time\nof the Merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in\nfavor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and it will constitute a\nwaiver of the stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.\nTherefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy\ncontaining instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby or abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nNeither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby nor\nabstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of\nSection 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the\nwritten demand before the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby at the Special Meeting will result in a loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares\nregistered in such holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Aerojet Rocketdyne of the identity of\nthe holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares of common stock in\nconnection with the Merger. If the shares of Common Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a\ntrustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares\nare owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be\nexecuted by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint\nowners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the\nrecord owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the\nrecord owner or owners.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK\nACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD\nCONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR\nAPPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN\nSHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK,\nBROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW\nPROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\n91\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAll written demands for appraisal under Section 262 should be delivered to:\nAerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.\nAttn: Corporate Secretary\n222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500\nEl Segundo, California 90245\nAny holder of shares of Common Stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the\nconsideration offered under the Merger Agreement by delivering to Aerojet Rocketdyne a written withdrawal of the\ndemand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective\nTime of the Merger will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation.\nNo appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that such dismissal will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time of the\nMerger.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within ten days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will\nnotify each holder of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal under Section 262 and\nwho has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby that\nthe Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof, and include with such notice a copy of Section 262.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of\nCommon Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 may\ncommence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the\nSurviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of\nthe shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has\nno present intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a\npetition or initiate any negotiations as to the fair value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of\nshares of Common Stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their\nappraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed by Section\n262. The failure of a holder of shares of common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262\nwill nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, any holder of shares of Common Stock who has complied\nwith the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nSurviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby as to which Aerojet Rocketdyne has received\ndemands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail\nthis statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a statement\nor within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A\nbeneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such\nperson\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing\nstatements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Common Stock and a copy thereof is served\nupon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to\nfile with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders\nwho have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not\nbeen reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the\n92\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDelaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who\nhave complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to exercise appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may require stockholders demanding appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to\nthe Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder\nfails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such\nstockholder. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceeding unless (i) the total number of\nshares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock eligible for appraisal or (ii) the\nvalue of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares of common stock exceeds $1\nmillion.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\nappraise the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to\nbe the fair value. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the\nEffective Time of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will\naccrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during\nthe period between the Effective Time of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. When the fair value is\ndetermined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued\nduring the pendency of the proceeding, if the Delaware Court of Chancery so determines, to the former Aerojet\nRocketdyne stockholders entitled to receive the same (in the case of shares represented by certificates, payment will\nnot be made until such certificates are surrendered to the surviving corporation). At any time before the entry of\njudgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each former stockholder entitled to appraisal an\namount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between\nthe amount paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest\ntheretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, and, if applicable, interest, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all\nrelevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be\nconsidered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or\nmethods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the\nvalue of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court\nmust consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other\nfacts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather\napplies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,\nthe Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would\nreceive under the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking\nfirm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to,\nand does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Aerojet Rocketdyne believes that the\nMerger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a\ndetermination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Aerojet Rocketdyne\nnor L3Harris anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights,\nand each of Aerojet Rocketdyne and L3Harris reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for\npurposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a\npetition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal\nproceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees\n93\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and imposed upon the\nparties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a\nstockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a\nstockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and\nexpenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Common Stock under Section 262 fails to\nperfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, such stockholder\u2019s shares of Common\nStock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time of the Merger into the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder\u2019s right to appraisal if no\npetition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger or if the stockholder delivers to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger\nConsideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time of the Merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be\nentitled to vote such shares of Common Stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other\ndistributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of Common Stock, if any,\npayable to stockholders as of a time before the Effective Time of the Merger. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or\nif the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an\nacceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time of the Merger or thereafter with the written\napproval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition\nfor appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as\nto any stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval\nof the court.\nFailure to comply exactly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a\nstockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is\nencouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights. \n94\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMULTIPLE SHAREHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS",

(\u201cAR Holdings\u201d) of the Consideration (defined below) to be received by\nsuch holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the\n\u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), proposed to be entered into among AR Holdings, L3Harris Technologies, Inc.

We express no opinion on the Additional Consideration.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft dated December 17, 2022 of the Merger Agreement and held\ndiscussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of AR Holdings concerning\nthe business, operations and prospects of AR Holdings.
