            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE TRANSACTION AND THE SPECIAL MEETING\nThe following are brief answers to certain questions that you, as a stockholder of KCS, may have regarding the transaction and the other matters\nbeing considered at the KCS special meeting. You are urged to carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents referred to in\nthis proxy statement/prospectus in their entirety because this section may not provide all the information that is important to you regarding these\nmatters. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cSummary\u201d on page 1 for a summary of important information regarding the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby. Additional important information is contained in the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference\ninto, this proxy statement/prospectus. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, without charge, by\nfollowing the instructions under the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information,\u201d on page 230.\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?\nA:\nYou are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because KCS has agreed to be acquired by CPRL through (1) a merger of first merger sub with\nand into KCS, with KCS surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of surviving merger sub, and (2) immediately thereafter, a merger of KCS with and\ninto surviving merger sub, with surviving merger sub surviving the second merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of CPRL (which we refer to\nas the \u201csecond surviving corporation\u201d following the second merger). The merger agreement, which governs the terms and conditions of the\ntransaction, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.\nYour vote is required in connection with the transaction. KCS is sending these materials to KCS stockholders to help them decide how to vote their\nshares with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement, among other important matters.\nQ:\nWhat matters am I being asked to vote on?\nA:\nIn order to complete the transaction, among other things, KCS stockholders must approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement in\naccordance with the DGCL (which proposal we refer to as the \u201cKCS merger proposal\u201d).\nKCS is holding the KCS special meeting to obtain approval of the KCS merger proposal. At the KCS special meeting, KCS stockholders will also be\nasked to consider and vote on:\n\u2022\na proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to KCS\u2019s named executive\nofficers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which proposal we refer to as the\n\u201cKCS compensation proposal\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\na proposal to adjourn the KCS special meeting to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the KCS special\nmeeting to approve the KCS merger proposal or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to this proxy statement/prospectus is timely\nprovided to KCS stockholders (which proposal we refer to as the \u201cKCS adjournment proposal\u201d).\nYour vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The approval of the KCS merger proposal is a condition to the\nobligations of the parties to complete the transaction. Neither the approval of the KCS compensation proposal nor the approval of the KCS\nadjournment proposal is a condition to the obligations of the parties to complete the transaction.\nQ:\nWhen and where will the KCS special meeting take place?\nA:\nThe KCS special meeting will be held virtually via the internet on December 10, 2021, beginning at 9:00 a.m., Central Time. The KCS special meeting\nwill be held solely via live audio webcast and there will not be a physical meeting location. KCS stockholders will be able to attend the KCS special\nmeeting online\nxviiiTable of Contents\nand vote their shares electronically during the meeting by visiting https://meetnow.global/MXZ6AKV (which we refer to as the \u201cspecial meeting\nwebsite\u201d). If you choose to attend the KCS special meeting and vote your shares during the KCS special meeting, you will need the control number\nlocated on your proxy card as described in the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Special Meeting\u2014 Date, Time and Place of the KCS Special Meeting\u201d\non page 41.\nEven if you plan to attend the KCS special meeting, KCS recommends that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote\nwill be counted if you later decide not to or become unable to attend the KCS special meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d, you must register in advance to attend the special meeting. To register you must submit proof of your\nproxy power (legal proxy) reflecting your holdings of our stock, along with your name and email address to Computershare. Requests for\nregistration must be labeled as \u201cLegal Proxy\u201d and be received no later than 9:00 a.m., Central Time, on December 8, 2021. You will receive a\nconfirmation email from Computershare of your registration. Requests for registration should be directed to Computershare at the following:\n\u2022\nBy Email: Forward the email from your broker, or attach an image of your legal proxy, to legalproxy@computershare.com.\nQ:\nDoes my vote matter?\nA:\nYes, your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The transaction cannot be completed unless, among other\nthings, the KCS merger proposal is approved by KCS stockholders.\nA failure to return or submit your proxy or to vote at the KCS special meeting as provided in this proxy statement/prospectus will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the KCS merger proposal. The failure to return or submit your proxy and to attend the KCS special meeting will have\nno effect on the KCS compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present) or the KCS adjournment proposal, but the failure of any shares\npresent or represented by proxy at the KCS special meeting to vote on the proposal will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the KCS\ncompensation proposal and \u201cAGAINST\u201d the KCS adjournment proposal, as applicable. The KCS board unanimously recommends that you vote\n\u201cFOR\u201d the KCS merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS adjournment proposal.\nQ:\nWhat will KCS stockholders receive for their shares if the transaction is completed?\nA:\nUnder the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of common stock of KCS, par value $0.01 per share (which we refer to as \u201cKCS\ncommon stock\u201d), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger (which we refer to as the \u201ceffective time\u201d) (other\nthan certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive (1) the \u201cexchange ratio\u201d of 2.884\nvalidly issued, fully paid and non-assessable CPRL common shares (which we refer to as the \u201cshare consideration\u201d) and (2) $90.00 in cash, without\ninterest (which we refer to as the \u201ccash consideration\u201d and, together with the share consideration, as the \u201cmerger consideration\u201d), and each share\nof 4% noncumulative preferred stock of KCS, par value $25.00 per share (which we refer to as \u201cKCS preferred stock\u201d), issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement), will be converted into the right to\nreceive $37.50 in cash, without interest (which we refer to as the \u201cpreferred merger consideration\u201d). Each holder of KCS common stock will receive\ncash (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes) in lieu of any fractional CPRL common shares that such stockholder would\notherwise receive as merger consideration in the transaction. Any cash amounts to be received by holders of KCS common stock in lieu of any\nfractional CPRL common shares will be rounded down to the nearest cent.\nThe exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect changes in the price of KCS common stock or CPRL common shares prior to the\neffective time. The CPRL common shares issued in connection with the transaction will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (which we refer\nto as the \u201cNYSE\u201d) and the\nxix\nTable of Contents\nToronto Stock Exchange (which we refer to as the \u201cTSX\u201d) under the symbol \u201cCP.\u201d Based on the number of shares of KCS common stock and CPRL\ncommon shares outstanding on October 29, 2021, upon completion of the transaction, we expect that former holders of KCS common stock would\nown approximately 28% of the outstanding common shares of CPRL, and holders of CPRL common shares (whom we refer to as \u201cCPRL\nshareholders\u201d) immediately prior to the transaction would own approximately 72% of the outstanding common shares of CPRL. KCS common stock\nand KCS preferred stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbols \u201cKSU\u201d and \u201cKSU-P,\u201d respectively. We encourage you to obtain current quotes\nfor the CPRL common shares and the KCS common stock.\nBecause CPRL will issue a fixed number of CPRL common shares in exchange for each share of KCS common stock, the value of the merger\nconsideration that holders of KCS common stock will receive in the transaction will depend on the market price of CPRL common shares at the\neffective time and will not be known at the time that KCS stockholders vote on the transaction. The market price of CPRL common shares that\nholders of KCS common stock receive at the effective time could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of CPRL common shares\non the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the KCS special meeting. Accordingly, you should obtain current market quotations\nfor CPRL common shares and KCS common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to the KCS merger proposal. Based on the closing price\nof CPRL common shares of $72.71 on the NYSE on August 9, 2021, the last full trading day prior to that on which CPRL submitted a revised offer to\nacquire KCS, the implied value of the merger consideration to holders of KCS common stock was approximately $299.70 per share of KCS common\nstock. On October 29, 2021, the latest practicable trading day before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the closing price of CPRL common\nshares on the NYSE was $77.40 per share, resulting in an implied value of the merger consideration to holders of KCS common stock of $313.22 per\nshare of KCS common stock.\nFor more information regarding the merger consideration to be received by KCS stockholders if the transaction is completed, see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Merger Consideration\u201d on page 139.\nQ:\nHow does the KCS board recommend that I vote at the KCS special meeting?\nA:\nThe KCS board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the\nKCS adjournment proposal.\nIn considering the recommendations of the KCS board, KCS stockholders should be aware that KCS directors and executive officers have interests\nin the transaction that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of KCS stockholders generally. These interests may include the treatment of\noutstanding KCS stock options, KCS restricted share awards, KCS performance share awards and KCS director deferred stock (which we\ncollectively refer to as \u201cKCS equity awards\u201d) under the merger agreement, the potential payment of severance benefits and acceleration of\noutstanding KCS equity awards upon certain terminations of employment, retention awards and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance\ncoverage. For a more complete description of these interests, see the information provided in the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014\nInterests of KCS\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction\u201d on page 102.\nQ:\nIf my KCS stock is represented by physical stock certificates, should I send my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. After the transaction is completed, you will receive a transmittal form from the exchange agent with instructions for the surrender of your KCS\nstock certificates. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.\nQ:\nWho may vote at the KCS special meeting?\nA:\nAll holders of record of shares of KCS voting stock who held shares at the close of business on October 14, 2021 (which we refer to as the \u201crecord\ndate\u201d) are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the KCS special meeting. Shares held through the KCS 401(k) Plan must be voted prior to the\nmeeting and by\nx\nx\nTable of Contents\n9:00 a.m. Central Time on December 8, 2021. Each such holder of KCS voting stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought\nbefore the KCS special meeting for each share of KCS voting stock that such holder owned of record as of the record date. Attendance at the KCS\nspecial meeting is not required to vote. See below and the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Special Meeting\u2014Voting by Proxy or in Person\u201d on page 44\nfor instructions on how to vote your shares without attending the KCS special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is a stockholder\u2019s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such stockholder on their behalf. The document used to\ndesignate a proxy to vote your shares of KCS voting stock is referred to as a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\nQ:\nHow many votes does each share of KCS voting stock have?\nA:\nEach KCS stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of KCS voting stock held of record as of the record date. As of the record date, there\nwere 91,194,982 outstanding shares of KCS voting stock.\nQ:\nHow many votes must be present to hold the KCS special meeting?\nA:\nA quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be represented, either by the appearance of the stockholder in person (including virtually)\nor through representation by proxy, to hold a valid meeting.\nHolders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the KCS capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote must be present via the\nspecial meeting website or represented by proxy at the KCS special meeting in order to constitute a quorum.\nIf a quorum is not present, the KCS special meeting may be adjourned or postponed until the holders of the number of shares of KCS voting stock\nrequired to constitute a quorum attend.\nQ:\nWhere will the CPRL common shares that I receive in the transaction be publicly traded?\nA:\nThe CPRL common shares to be issued to holders of KCS common stock in the transaction will be listed for trading on the NYSE and TSX under the\nsymbol \u201cCP.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat happens if the transaction is not completed?\nA:\nIf the KCS merger proposal is not approved by KCS stockholders, or if the transaction is not completed for any other reason, KCS stockholders will\nnot receive the merger consideration, the preferred merger consideration or any other consideration in connection with the transaction, and their\nshares of KCS stock will remain outstanding.\nIf the transaction is not completed, CPRL and KCS will each remain public companies independent of one another, the KCS common stock will\ncontinue to be listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cKSU\u201d and the KCS preferred stock will continue to be listed and traded on the\nNYSE under the symbol \u201cKSU-P.\u201d\nIn the event that the transaction is completed, but STB final approval is not obtained and CPRL is not permitted to acquire control over KCS\u2019s\nrailroad operations, KCS stockholders will retain the merger consideration, the preferred merger consideration and any other consideration received\nin connection with the transaction, and thus will continue to hold any CPRL common shares issued in connection with the transaction.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, KCS may be required to pay CPRL a termination payment of $700.0 million\nand/or the CN termination amount refund of $700.0 million. If the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, CPRL may be\nrequired to pay KCS a\nxxi\nTable of Contents\ntermination payment of either $700.0 million or $1.0 billion, depending on the reason for termination. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement\u201d on page 164 for a more detailed discussion of the termination payments.\nQ:\nWhat is a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d?\nA:\nUnder the NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees may use their discretion to vote \u201cuninstructed\u201d shares (i.e., shares of record held by\nbanks, brokers or other nominees, but with respect to which the beneficial owner of such shares has not provided instructions on how to vote on a\nparticular proposal) with respect to matters that are considered to be \u201croutine,\u201d but not with respect to \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters. All of the KCS\nproposals are \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters under NYSE rules.\nA \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d occurs on an item when (1) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more proposals to\nbe voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the\nshares, and (2) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with such instructions. Because all of the KCS proposals are\nnon-routine matters under NYSE rules for which brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote, KCS does not expect there to be any broker\nnon-votes at the KCS special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat stockholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal at the KCS special meeting? What will happen if I fail to vote or abstain from\nvoting on each proposal at the KCS special meeting?\nA:\nProposal 1: KCS Merger Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the KCS special meeting, approval of the KCS merger proposal requires the\naffirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of KCS voting stock entitled to vote on the KCS merger proposal. Accordingly, a\nKCS stockholder\u2019s abstention from voting or the failure of any KCS stockholder to vote (including the failure of a KCS stockholder who holds their\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee to give voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee with respect to\nthe KCS merger proposal) will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the KCS merger proposal.\nProposal 2: KCS Compensation Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the KCS special meeting, approval of the advisory KCS compensation\nproposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of KCS voting stock present at the KCS special meeting in person\n(including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the KCS compensation proposal. Accordingly, if a KCS stockholder present in\nperson (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting abstains from voting, or responds by proxy with an \u201cabstain\u201d vote, it will have the same\neffect as a vote cast \u201cAGAINST\u201d the KCS compensation proposal. If a KCS stockholder is not present in person (including virtually) at the KCS\nspecial meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for the KCS compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is\npresent).\nProposal 3: KCS Adjournment Proposal. Approval of the KCS adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the\nshares of KCS voting stock present at the KCS special meeting in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the\nKCS adjournment proposal (whether or not a quorum is present). Accordingly, if a KCS stockholder present in person (including virtually) at the\nKCS special meeting abstains from voting, or responds by proxy with an \u201cabstain\u201d vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nKCS adjournment proposal. If a KCS stockholder is not present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting and does not respond by\nproxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become\npayable to KCS\u2019s named executive officers (i.e., the KCS compensation proposal)?\nA:\nUnder SEC rules, KCS is required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote of its stockholders with respect to the compensation that may be paid or\nbecome payable to KCS\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nxxii\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat happens if KCS stockholders do not approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to KCS\u2019s\nnamed executive officers (i.e., the KCS compensation proposal)?\nA:\nBecause the vote to approve the KCS compensation proposal is advisory in nature, the outcome of the vote will not be binding upon KCS or the\ncombined company, and the completion of the transaction is not conditioned or dependent upon the approval of the KCS compensation proposal.\nAccordingly, the compensation that is subject to the vote, which is described in the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Interests of\nKCS\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction\u201d on page 102 of this proxy statement/prospectus, may be paid to KCS\u2019s named executive\nofficers even if KCS\u2019s stockholders do not approve the KCS compensation proposal.\nQ:\nHow can I vote my shares at the KCS special meeting?\nA:\nShares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record of KCS may be voted during the KCS special meeting via the special meeting\nwebsite. If you choose to vote your shares during the virtual meeting, you will need the control number included on your proxy card in order to\naccess the special meeting website and to vote as described in the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Special Meeting\u2014Voting by Proxy or in Person\u201d on\npage 44.\nIf you hold your shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d, you must register in advance to attend the special meeting.

You will receive a\nconfirmation email from Computershare of your registration. Requests for registration should be directed to Computershare at the following:\n\u2022\nBy Email: Forward the email from your broker, or attach an image of your legal proxy, to legalproxy@computershare.com.\nEven if you plan to attend the KCS special meeting, KCS recommends that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote\nwill be counted if you later decide not to or become unable to attend the KCS special meeting.\nAdditional information on attending the KCS special meeting can be found under the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Special Meeting\u201d on page 41.\nQ:\nHow do participants in the KCS 401(k) Plan vote?\nA:\nIf you participate in the KCS 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the \u201cKCS 401(k) Plan\u201d) and own shares of KCS common stock in your account, you\nshould have received a full set of printed proxy materials, including a voting instruction form to instruct the trustee of the KCS 401(k) Plan how to\nvote the shares of KCS common stock held on your behalf. The trustee is required under the trust agreement to vote the shares in accordance with\nthe instructions given on the voting instruction form. Voting instructions may also be given by Internet or telephone by participants in the KCS\n401(k) Plan. The voting instruction form contains the Internet address and toll-free number. If voting instructions are not received from a\nparticipant, the trustee must vote those shares, as well as any unallocated shares, in the same proportions as the shares for which voting\ninstructions were received from plan participants. Voting instructions by Internet or telephone must be given by 9:00 a.m., Central Time, on\nDecember 8, 2021. Unless you give voting instructions by Internet or telephone, the voting instruction form should be returned in the envelope\nprovided to Computershare. The voting instruction form should not be returned to us. KCS 401(k) Plan participants who wish to revoke their voting\ninstructions must contact the trustee and follow its procedures.\nxxiii\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nAre the votes of participants in the KCS 401(k) Plan confidential?\nA:\nUnder the terms of the KCS 401(k) Plan, the trustee is required to establish procedures to ensure that the instructions received from participants are\nheld in confidence and not divulged, released or otherwise utilized in a manner that might influence the participants\u2019 free exercise of their voting\nrights.\nQ:\nHow can I vote my shares without attending the KCS special meeting?\nA:\nWhether you hold your shares directly as the stockholder of record of KCS or beneficially in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may direct your vote by proxy\nwithout attending the KCS special meeting via the special meeting website. If you are a stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the\ninternet, or by telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. Please note that if you hold shares\nbeneficially in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.\nAdditional information on voting procedures can be found under the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Special Meeting\u201d on page 41.\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name?\u201d\nA:\nIf your shares of KCS voting stock are registered directly in your name with Computershare, the transfer agent for KCS, you are considered the\nstockholder of record with respect to those shares. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote your shares directly at the KCS special\nmeeting. You may also grant a proxy for your vote directly to KCS or to a third party to vote your shares at the KCS special meeting.\nIf your shares of KCS voting stock are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet\nname.\u201d Your bank, broker or other nominee will send you, as the beneficial owner, a package describing the procedures for voting your shares and\nyou must instruct the bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote them by following the instructions that the bank, broker or other nominee\nprovides to you with these proxy materials. Most banks, brokers and other nominees offer the ability for stockholders to submit voting instructions\nby mail by completing a voting instruction card, by telephone, and by the internet.\nQ:\nIf my shares of KCS voting stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my bank, broker or other nominee\nautomatically vote those shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of KCS voting stock if you instruct your bank, broker or other\nnominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares.\nUnder NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of KCS voting stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d for their customers have authority to\nvote on \u201croutine\u201d proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers and other nominees are\nprohibited from exercising their voting discretion with respect to non-routine matters, which include all the KCS proposals. As a result, absent\nspecific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, banks, brokers and other nominees are not empowered to vote such shares.\nSince there are no items on the agenda that your broker has discretionary authority to vote upon, your shares will not be counted as present at the\nKCS special meeting for the purposes of determining a quorum if you fail to instruct your broker on how to vote on the KCS proposals. If you fail\nto submit any instruction to your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have no effect on the KCS compensation proposal, assuming that a quorum\nis otherwise present, and it will have no effect on the KCS adjournment proposal. However, failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee\non how to vote will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the KCS merger proposal.\nxxiv\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the KCS special meeting?\nA:\nIf you hold shares of KCS voting stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d and also directly in your name as a stockholder of record or otherwise, or if you hold\nshares of KCS voting stock in more than one brokerage account, you may receive more than one set of voting materials relating to the KCS special\nmeeting.\nRecord Holders. For shares held directly, please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card (or cast your vote by telephone or via the internet\nas provided on each proxy card) or otherwise follow the voting instructions provided in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to ensure that all\nof your shares of KCS voting stock held directly by you are voted.\nShares in \u201cstreet name.\u201d For shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the procedures provided by\nyour bank, broker or other nominee to make sure that you vote all of your shares held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of KCS voting stock voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your shares of KCS voting stock in the\nway that you indicate. For each item before the KCS special meeting, you may specify whether your shares of KCS voting stock should be voted\nfor or against, or should abstain from voting.\nQ:\nHow will my shares of KCS voting stock be voted if I return a blank proxy?\nA:\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy and do not indicate how you want your shares of KCS voting stock to be voted, then your shares of KCS\nvoting stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the KCS board: \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS\ncompensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS adjournment proposal.\nQ:\nCan I change my vote after I have submitted my proxy?\nA:\nAny KCS stockholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke the proxy and change their vote before the proxy is voted at the KCS special meeting\nby doing any of the following:\n\u2022\nsubsequently submitting a new proxy (including by submitting a proxy via the internet or telephone) for the KCS special meeting that is\nreceived by the deadline specified on the accompanying proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\ngiving written notice of your revocation to KCS\u2019s Corporate Secretary\u037e or\n\u2022\nvoting at the KCS special meeting.\nExecution or revocation of a proxy will not in any way affect your right to attend the KCS special meeting and vote thereat. Written notices of\nrevocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of proxies should be addressed to:\nKansas City Southern\n427 West 12th Street,\nKansas City, Missouri 64105\n1-888-800-3690\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nFor more information, see the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Special Meeting\u2014Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a KCS Stockholder\u2019s Vote\u201d on\npage 45.\nxxv\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nIf I hold my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d can I change my voting instructions after I have submitted voting instructions to my bank, broker or other\nnominee?\nA:\nIf your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and you previously provided voting instructions to your bank, broker or\nother nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to revoke or change your voting instructions.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the KCS special meeting?\nA:\nThe preliminary voting results for the KCS special meeting are expected to be announced at the KCS special meeting. In addition, within four\nbusiness days following certification of the final voting results KCS will file the final voting results of the KCS special meeting (or, if the final voting\nresults have not yet been certified, the preliminary results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nQ:\nDo KCS stockholders have dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights?\nA:\nYes. If a KCS stockholder wants to exercise appraisal rights and receive the fair value of shares of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock in\ncash instead of the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, then you must file a written objection with KCS prior to\nthe KCS special meeting stating, among other things, that you will exercise your right to dissent if the transaction is completed. Also, you may not\nvote in favor of the KCS merger proposal and must follow other procedures, both before and after the KCS special meeting, as described in Annex\nD to this proxy statement/prospectus. Note that if you return a signed proxy card without voting instructions or with instructions to vote \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe KCS merger proposal, then your shares will automatically be voted in favor of the KCS merger proposal and you will lose all appraisal rights\navailable under Delaware law. A summary of these provisions can be found under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Shares Subject to Properly Exercised\nAppraisal Rights\u201d on page 139. Due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, KCS stockholders who are\nconsidering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel. Failure to strictly comply with the applicable Delaware law\nprovisions will result in the loss of the right of appraisal.\nQ:\nAre there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the KCS merger proposal?\nA:\nYes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d on page 22. You also should read and\ncarefully consider the risk factors with respect to KCS and CPRL that are contained in the documents that are incorporated by reference into this\nproxy statement/prospectus.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of KCS voting stock after the record date but before the KCS special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date is earlier than the date of the KCS special meeting. If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of KCS voting stock after the record\ndate but before the KCS special meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the KCS special meeting.\nQ:\nWho is paying for the KCS special meeting and this proxy solicitation?\nA:\nKCS has engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc. (which we refer to as \u201cMacKenzie\u201d) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the KCS special meeting.\nKCS estimates that it will pay MacKenzie a fee of approximately $175,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. KCS has\nagreed to indemnify MacKenzie against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain\nexceptions).\nKCS also may be required to reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective agents for their expenses\nin forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of KCS voting\nxxvi\nTable of Contents\nstock. KCS\u2019s directors, officers and employees and CPRL\u2019s directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic\nmeans or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.\nQ:\nWhen is CPRL\u2019s acquisition of KCS expected to be completed?\nA:\nCPRL\u2019s acquisition of control over KCS\u2019s railroad operations will be completed in two stages. First, the transaction will occur and, following the\npost-closing contributions described in this proxy statement/prospectus, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving\ncorporation, as successor to KCS, will be deposited by Cygnus Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of\nCPRL (which we refer to as \u201cmerger holdco\u201d) into an independent, irrevocable voting trust (which we refer to as the \u201cvoting trust\u201d) under a voting\ntrust agreement (which we refer to as the \u201cvoting trust agreement\u201d) to be entered into by and among CPRL, merger holdco and the trustee, expected\nto be Mr. David L. Starling (whom we refer to as the \u201ctrustee\u201d), pending receipt of the final and non-appealable approval or exemption by the U.S.\nSurface Transportation Board (which we refer to as the \u201cSTB\u201d) of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\n11323 et seq. (which we refer to as \u201cSTB final approval\u201d).\nSubject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions described under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions that Must\nBe Satisfied or Waived for the Transaction to Occur\u201d on page 141, including approval of the KCS merger proposal by KCS stockholders, the\ntransaction is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2022. However, neither KCS nor CPRL can predict the actual date on which the\ntransaction will be completed, or if the transaction will be completed at all, because completion of the transaction is subject to conditions and\nfactors outside the control of both companies, including the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals. The merger agreement requires the\nfirst step of CPRL\u2019s acquisition of KCS to be completed by the end date of February 21, 2022 (provided, that to the extent the condition to obtain\nthe authorizations required to be obtained from COFECE and the IFT with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has\nnot been satisfied or waived on or prior to February 21, 2022, but all other conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived (except for those\nconditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing), the end date will be automatically extended to May 21, 2022).\nFollowing completion of the first step of CPRL\u2019s acquisition of KCS through the transaction and pending receipt of STB final approval and\napproval from other applicable regulatory authorities in order to complete the combination of CPRL and KCS, all outstanding shares of capital stock\nof the second surviving corporation will be held in the voting trust. STB review of the transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of\n2022. If STB final approval and approval from other applicable regulatory authorities is obtained, the voting trust would be terminated and CPRL\n(through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, merger holdco) would acquire control over KCS\u2019s railroad operations. For more information on the\nrequired regulatory approvals, the applicable regulatory processes and the conditions to the completion of CPRL\u2019s acquisition of KCS, see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction\u201d on page 110.\nQ:\nWhat equity stake will KCS stockholders hold in CPRL immediately following the transaction?\nA:\nBased on the number of CPRL common shares and shares of KCS common stock outstanding on October 29, 2021, at the effective time, former\nholders of KCS common stock are expected to own approximately 28% of the outstanding CPRL common shares, and persons who were CPRL\nshareholders immediately prior to the transaction are expected to own approximately 72% of the outstanding CPRL common shares. The relative\nownership interests of CPRL shareholders and former holders of KCS common stock in CPRL immediately following the transaction will depend on\nthe number of CPRL common shares and shares of KCS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the transaction.\nxxvii\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nIf I am a holder of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock, how will I receive the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration to\nwhich I am entitled?\nA:\nIf you hold your shares of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock in book-entry form, whether through The Depository Trust Company or\notherwise, you will not be required to take any specific actions to exchange your shares for CPRL common shares and the cash consideration. Your\nshares of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock will, at the effective time, be automatically exchanged for, as applicable, the CPRL common\nshares and cash (including any cash in lieu of any fractional CPRL common shares) to which you are entitled. If you instead hold your shares of\nKCS common stock or KCS preferred stock in certificated form, then, after receiving the proper and completed documentation from you following\nthe completion of the transaction, Computershare Investor Services Inc. or a bank or trust company or similar institution selected by CPRL with\nKCS\u2019s prior approval (which we refer to as the \u201cexchange agent\u201d) will deliver to you the CPRL common shares and cash (including any cash in lieu\nof any fractional CPRL common shares) to which you are entitled as merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable. More\ninformation may be found in the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Merger Consideration\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No Fractional\nShares\u201d on pages 139 and 139, respectively.\nQ:\nWill the CPRL common shares to be issued to holders of KCS common stock at the effective time be traded on an exchange?\nA:\nYes. It is a condition to the completion of the transaction that the CPRL common shares to be issued in connection with the first merger be\napproved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and the TSX, subject to customary listing conditions. All CPRL common\nshares received by holders of KCS common stock in connection with the transaction will be listed on the NYSE and the TSX under the symbol\n\u201cCP\u201d and may be traded on the exchanges by stockholders.\nCPRL common shares to be issued to KCS common stockholders in connection with the transaction will be freely transferable, except for CPRL\ncommon shares issued to any stockholder deemed to be an \u201caffiliate\u201d of CPRL for purposes of United States (which we refer to as the \u201cU.S.\u201d)\nfederal securities law. CPRL common shares to be issued to KCS common stockholders in connection with the transaction will not be legended and\nmay be resold in Canada through registered dealers provided that (i) the trade is not a \u201ccontrol distribution\u201d as defined in National Instrument 45-\n102\u2014Resale of Securities of the Canadian securities administrators, (ii) no unusual effort is made to prepare the market or to create a demand for the\nCPRL common shares, (iii) no extraordinary commission or consideration is paid to a person in respect of such sale, and (iv) if the selling security\nholder is an insider or officer of CPRL, as the case may be, the selling security holder has no reasonable grounds to believe that CPRL is in default\nof applicable Canadian securities law. For more information, see the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Restrictions on Resales of CPRL\nCommon Shares Received in the Transaction\u201d on page 119.\nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction?\nA:\nCPRL and KCS intend that the transaction will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d) and that Section 367(a)(1) of the Code will not apply to cause the transaction to result in gain\nrecognition by holders of KCS common stock that exchange their shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration (other than any such\nholder of KCS common stock who would be treated as a \u201cfive-percent transferee shareholder\u201d (within the meaning of Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii) of\nthe U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, which we refer to as the \u201cTreasury Regulations\u201d) of CPRL following the transaction who\ndoes not enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8 or does not comply with\nthe requirements of that agreement and Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8 for avoiding the recognition of gain, which we refer to as an\n\u201cexcepted shareholder\u201d). The obligation of KCS to complete the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton,\nRosen & Katz, special counsel to KCS, or another nationally recognized tax\nxxviii\nTable of Contents\ncounsel, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the transaction will\nqualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that the transaction will not result in gain recognition under\nSection 367(a)(1) of the Code by holders of KCS common stock (other than any excepted shareholder).\nAccordingly, on the basis of such opinion that the transaction will qualify as a reorganization and that Section 367(a) does not apply to require gain\nrecognition, a U.S. holder (other than an excepted shareholder) that exchanges shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration in the\ntransaction will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the cash consideration (excluding cash received in\nlieu of fractional CPRL common shares, if any) received by such U.S. holder in the transaction\u037e and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the cash\nconsideration (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional CPRL common shares, if any) plus the fair market value of the share consideration\n(including any fractional CPRL common shares deemed received) received by such U.S. holder in exchange for its shares of KCS common stock in\nthe transaction, over (b) such U.S. holder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of KCS common stock exchanged. In addition, a U.S. holder of KCS common\nstock generally will recognize gain or loss with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional CPRL common shares.\nThe exchange of KCS preferred stock for cash pursuant to the transaction generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. U.S. holders of KCS preferred stock will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount\nof cash received with respect to their shares of KCS preferred stock pursuant to the transaction and their adjusted tax basis in such shares.\nFor the definition of \u201cU.S. holder\u201d and a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S.\nholders, see the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\u201d on page 120.\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all KCS stockholders. The tax consequences to KCS stockholders will\ndepend on their individual situations. Accordingly, all KCS stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors for a full understanding of the\nparticular tax consequences of the transaction to them.\nQ:\nWhat are the material Canadian federal income tax consequences of the transaction?\nA:\nA Canadian resident holder (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax\nConsequences,\u201d on page 125) who disposes of their KCS common stock for CPRL common shares and cash consideration (including cash received\nin lieu of a fractional CPRL common share) in connection with the first merger will generally realize a capital gain (or capital loss) for Canadian\nfederal income tax purposes equal to the amount by which the sum of the aggregate of the fair market value of the CPRL common shares and cash\nconsideration received exceeds (or is less than) the adjusted cost base of the Canadian resident holder\u2019s KCS common stock determined\nimmediately before the disposition and any reasonable costs of disposition.\nA Canadian resident holder who disposes of their KCS preferred stock for cash consideration in connection with the first merger will generally\nrealize a capital gain (or capital loss) for Canadian federal income tax purposes equal to the amount by which the cash consideration received\nexceeds (or is less than) the adjusted cost base of the Canadian resident holder\u2019s KCS preferred stock determined immediately before the\ndisposition and any reasonable costs of disposition.\nA non-Canadian resident holder (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax\nConsequences,\u201d on page 125) will not be subject to tax under the Canadian tax act on any capital gain realized on a disposition of KCS common\nstock or KCS preferred stock, as the case may be, in connection with the first merger, or on a subsequent disposition of a CPRL common share\nacquired as result of the first merger, as applicable, unless the relevant share is \u201ctaxable Canadian property,\u201d and is not \u201ctreaty-protected property\u201d\n(as those terms are defined in the Canadian tax act) of the non-Canadian resident holder, at the time of the disposition.\nxxix\nTable of Contents\nFor more information, see the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Consequences,\u201d on page 125.\nQ:\nIs the exchange ratio subject to adjustment based on changes in the prices of KCS common stock or CPRL common shares? Can it be adjusted\nfor any other reason?\nA:\nFor the share consideration portion of the merger consideration, for each share of KCS common stock, you will receive a fixed number of CPRL\ncommon shares equal to the exchange ratio of 2.884, not a number of shares that will be determined based on a fixed market value. The market value\nof CPRL common shares and the market value of KCS common stock at the effective time may vary significantly from their respective values on the\ndate that the merger agreement was executed or at other dates, such as the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the KCS special\nmeeting. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including changes in CPRL\u2019s or KCS\u2019s respective businesses, operations or\nprospects, regulatory considerations, and general business, market, industry or economic conditions. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted to\nreflect any changes in the market value of CPRL common shares or the market value of KCS common stock. Therefore, the aggregate market value\nof the CPRL common shares that you are entitled to receive at the effective time could vary significantly from the value of such shares on the date\nof this proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the KCS special meeting. See the risk factor entitled \u201cBecause the exchange ratio is fixed and the\nmarket price of shares of CPRL common shares has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, KCS stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the\nmerger consideration they will receive in the transaction prior to the closing of the transaction,\u201d on page 22.\nHowever, the merger consideration will be equitably adjusted to provide you and CPRL with the same economic effect as contemplated by the\nmerger agreement in the event of any further reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,\nrecapitalization, merger or other similar transaction involving KCS common stock or CPRL common shares prior to the effective time.\nQ:\nWhat should I do now?\nA:\nYou should read this proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety, including the annexes, and return your completed, signed and dated\nproxy card(s) by mail in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or submit your voting instructions by telephone or over the internet as soon as\npossible so that your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions.\nQ:\nHow can I find more information about KCS or CPRL?\nA:\nYou can find more information about KCS or CPRL from various sources described in the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional\nInformation,\u201d on page 230 of this proxy statement/prospectus.\nQ:\nWhom do I call if I have questions about the KCS special meeting or the transaction?\nA:\nIf you have questions about the KCS special meeting or the transaction, or desire additional copies of this proxy statement/prospectus or\nadditional proxies, you may contact:\nMacKenzie Partners, Inc.\nKCS Stockholders call toll-free from the U.S. and Canada\nat 1-800-322-2885\nor direct at 1-212-929-5500 from other locations\nBanks and brokers may call collect at 1-212-929-5500\nx\nx\nx\nTable of Contents\nSUMMARY",

Laredo is a principal international gateway through which a substantial portion of rail and\ntruck traffic between the U.S. and Mexico crosses the border. KCSM serves most of Mexico\u2019s principal industrial cities and three of its major\nseaports. KCSM\u2019s rail lines provide exclusive rail access to the U.S. and Mexico border crossing at Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. Under the\nconcession, KCSM has the right to use and operate the southern half of the rail bridge at Laredo, Texas, which spans the Rio Grande River between\nthe U.S. and Mexico.

Tex-\nMex owns a 160-mile rail line extending from Laredo, Texas to the port city of Corpus Christi, Texas, which connects the operations of KCSR with\nKCSM.\nThe Kansas City Southern coordinated rail network (KCSR, KCSM and Tex-Mex, including trackage rights) comprises approximately 7,100 route\nmiles extending from the Midwest and Southeast regions of the U.S. south into Mexico and connects with all other Class 1 railroads, providing\nshippers with an effective alternative to other railroad routes and giving direct access to Mexico and the Southeast and Southwest U.S. through\nalternate interchange hubs.\nPanama Canal Railway Company (which we refer to as \u201cPCRC\u201d), an unconsolidated joint venture company owned equally by Kansas City Southern\nand Mi-Jack Products, Inc. (which we refer to as \u201cMi-Jack\u201d), was awarded a concession from the Republic of Panama to reconstruct and operate the\nPanama Canal Railway, a 47-mile railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides international container shipping companies with a\nrailway transportation alternative to the Panama Canal. The concession was awarded in 1998 for an initial term of 25 years with an automatic renewal\nfor an additional 25-year term. The Panama Canal Railway is a north-south railroad traversing the isthmus of Panama between the Atlantic and\nPacific oceans.\nOther subsidiaries and affiliates of Kansas City Southern include the following:\n\u2022\nMeridian Speedway, LLC, a 70% owned consolidated affiliate that owns the former KCSR rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and\nShreveport, Louisiana, which is the portion of the rail line between Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as the \u201cMeridian Speedway.\u201d\nNorfolk Southern Corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, owns the\nremaining 30% of MSLLC\u037e\n\u2022\nTFCM, S. de R.L. de C.V., a 45% owned unconsolidated affiliate that operates a bulk liquid terminal in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico\u037e\n\u2022\nFerrocarril y Terminal del Valle de M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V., a 25% owned unconsolidated affiliate that provides railroad services as well as\nancillary services in the greater Mexico City area\u037e and\n\u2022\nPTC-220, LLC, a 14% owned unconsolidated affiliate that holds the licenses to large blocks of radio spectrum and other assets for\npositive train control.\nKCS is a public company.

Accordingly, a KCS stockholder\u2019s abstention from voting\nor the failure of any KCS stockholder to vote (including the failure of a KCS stockholder who holds their shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank,\nbroker or other nominee to give voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee with respect to the KCS merger proposal) will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the KCS merger proposal.\nRequired Vote to Approve the KCS Compensation Proposal\nAssuming a quorum is present at the KCS special meeting, approval of the KCS compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a\nmajority of the shares of KCS voting stock present at the KCS special meeting in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to\nvote on the KCS compensation proposal. Accordingly, if a KCS stockholder present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting\nabstains\n7Table of Contents\nfrom voting, or responds by proxy with an \u201cabstain\u201d vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast \u201cAGAINST\u201d the KCS compensation proposal. If\na KCS stockholder is not present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on\nthe vote count for the KCS compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present).\nRequired Vote to Approve the KCS Adjournment Proposal\nApproval of the KCS adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of KCS voting stock present at the KCS\nspecial meeting in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the KCS adjournment proposal (whether or not a\nquorum is present). Accordingly, if a KCS stockholder present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting abstains from voting, or\nresponds by proxy with an \u201cabstain\u201d vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast \u201cAGAINST\u201d the KCS adjournment proposal. If a KCS\nstockholder is not present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the\nvote count for such proposal.\nVoting by Directors and Executive Officers\nAs of the record date, KCS directors and executive officers, and their affiliates, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote approximately 0.44% of\nthe total outstanding shares of KCS common stock and 0.0% of the total outstanding shares of KCS preferred stock. Although no KCS director or\nexecutive officer has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so, KCS currently expects that all of its directors and executive officers will\nvote their shares \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS adjournment proposal.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, CPRL has agreed to issue 2.884 CPRL common shares and $90.00 in\ncash, without interest, in exchange for each share of KCS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. Issuances\nby KCS of shares of KCS common stock are restricted under the terms of the merger agreement, subject to certain limited exceptions or the prior\nwritten consent of CPRL. As a result, the actual number of CPRL common shares that will be issued at the effective time will depend on the number\nof shares of KCS common stock, KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred stock outstanding at such time.\nCPRL shareholders will be required to approve the issuance of such number of CPRL common shares as is necessary under the merger agreement to\nissue the share consideration. As described in the TSX listing application filed by CPRL, based on the number of shares of KCS common stock\noutstanding as of September 9, 2021, CPRL anticipates up to 277,960,197 CPRL common shares to be issuable to KCS common stockholders under\nthe terms of the merger agreement, which represents approximately 42% of the issued and outstanding CPRL common shares as of September 9, 2021\n(which we refer to as the \u201cCPRL common share issuance\u201d).

Despite the fact that CPRL shareholders are being asked to approve the issuance of up to 277,960,197 CPRL\ncommon shares, based on the number of shares of KCS common stock outstanding as of September 9, 2021, CPRL expects that it would issue (at the\ndirection of surviving merger sub and on behalf of surviving merger sub) up to approximately 264,723,997 CPRL common shares in the first merger\nand is seeking CPRL shareholder approval for the issuance of up to 13,236,200 additional CPRL common shares to accommodate the effects of\nrounding and for other administrative purposes in accordance with the policies of the TSX.\nThe actual number of CPRL common shares to be issued or reserved for issuance under the merger agreement will be determined immediately prior to\nthe effective time based on the exchange ratio, the number of shares of KCS common stock outstanding at such time and the number of KCS\nrestricted share awards and KCS director deferred stock outstanding at such time.\nCPRL will be holding the special meeting of CPRL shareholders on December 8, 2021 (which we refer to, including any adjournments or\npostponements thereof, as the \u201cCPRL special meeting\u201d) to vote on the resolutions necessary to complete the transaction and other matters to be\nconsidered by the CPRL shareholders at such special meeting. In addition to the above-mentioned resolution approving the CPRL common share\nissuance, at the CPRL special meeting, CPRL shareholders entitled to vote at the CPRL special meeting will be asked to approve a special resolution\nauthorizing and approving an amendment to the articles of CPRL to change its name to \u201cCanadian Pacific Kansas City,\u201d which amendment is\nconditional upon completion of the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval.

The voting trust agreement proposed for use with the transaction is unchanged from that modified in response to the STB\u2019s May 6\ndecision.\nOn September 15, 2021, CPRL and KCS filed with the STB an Amended Notice of Intent indicating that they had entered a new agreement providing\nfor CPRL\u2019s acquisition of KCS, that they would file an application seeking STB control approval on or shortly after October 20, 2021, and that CPRL\nintended to indirectly acquire the shares of KCS prior to receiving control approval via the use of a voting trust that was substantially identical to\nthat reviewed and approved by the STB in its May 6 decision.\nOn September 30, 2021, the STB issued a decision confirming that the transaction described in the September 15 Amended Notice of Intent was the\n\u201csame transaction\u201d that had been noticed in March 2021 and that the STB\u2019s May 6, 2021 approval for CPRL\u2019s proposed use of a voting trust to\nacquire KCS applies to the voting trust proposed for use with the transaction agreed to on September 15.\nOn October 29, 2021, CPRL and KCS filed their application seeking STB final approval for CPRL to control KCS and its U.S. rail carrier subsidiaries.\nUnder the merger agreement, CPRL and KCS must use reasonable best efforts to prosecute all filings and other presentations made, and promptly\nmake any subsequent filings or presentations, with the STB with diligence, diligently oppose any third party\u2019s objections to, appeals from or\npetitions to reconsider or reopen any approval, opinion, exemption or other authorization obtained from the STB, and take all such further action as\nin the reasonable judgment of CPRL and KCS may facilitate obtaining STB final approval.\nCFIUS\nThe transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (which\nwe refer to as \u201cCFIUS\u201d) pursuant to Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder\n(which we refer to as \u201cSection 721\u201d). Under the terms of the merger agreement, CPRL may not assume control over KCS\u2019s railroad operations until:\n(a) CFIUS has determined that there are no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, and the parties have received written notice from CFIUS that action under Section 721 has been concluded\u037e (b) the parties have received\nwritten notice from CFIUS that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not \u201ccovered transactions\u201d pursuant to Section 721\u037e or\n(c) CFIUS has sent a report to the President of the U.S. requesting the decision of the President of the U.S. with respect to the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement and (i) the period under Section 721 during which the President of the U.S. may announce his decision to\ntake action to suspend, prohibit or place any limitations on the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has expired without any such\naction being threatened, announced or taken or (ii) the President of the U.S. has announced a decision not to, or otherwise declined to, take any\naction to suspend or prohibit the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which we collectively refer to as \u201ccompletion of the CFIUS\nProcess\u201d).\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe merger agreement provides for CPRL and KCS to cooperate regarding the preparation and filing with CFIUS of a declaration and/or a joint\nvoluntary notification in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cThe KCS\nMerger Proposal\u2014Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction,\u201d on page 110 for additional detail regarding CFIUS.\nCOFECE and the IFT\nPursuant to the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Law and the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law, consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement requires the approval of the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Competencia Econ\u00f3mica (the Mexican\nAntitrust Commission) (which we refer to as \u201cCOFECE\u201d) and the Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (the Mexican Federal\nTelecommunications Institute) (which we refer to as the \u201cIFT,\u201d and, together with COFECE, the \u201cMexican antitrust authorities\u201d), autonomous\nconstitutional entities responsible for enforcing the Federal Economic Competition Law in the sectors of their respective jurisdiction, including\nreviewing and authorizing concentrations, when applicable. Such notifications may be submitted in parallel, and the procedures follow the same\nrules and legal time frame.\nThe merger agreement provides that KCS, CPRL, first merger sub and surviving merger sub were obligated to promptly, but in any event no later\nthan 30 business days after the date of the merger agreement, file any and all notifications and report forms to the Mexican antitrust authorities, in\neach case as required under applicable law with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and take all other actions\nnecessary to cause the expiration or termination of the process under applicable law as soon as practicable after the date of the merger agreement\n(i.e., September 15, 2021).\nNotifications of the transaction were submitted to the IFT on October 4, 2021 and to COFECE on October 5, 2021. The Mexican antitrust authorities\nwill each have 60 business days to review the transaction and issue a resolution (as such period is calculated and may be extended under Mexican\nlaw, as described in the Section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction,\u201d on page 110). If the\nMexican antitrust authorities do not issue a resolution within the relevant review period (including any extension, if applicable), the transaction will\nbe deemed approved. Failure to obtain clearance from the Mexican antitrust authorities precludes the parties from closing the transaction in Mexico.\nARTF and SCT\nKCS and CPRL (through KCSM) have filed notices with the Mexican Agencia Reguladora del Transporte Ferroviario (the Regulatory Agency of Rail\nTransportation of Mexico) (which we refer to as \u201cARTF\u201d) and the Secretar\u00eda de Comunicaciones y Transportes (the Secretary of Communications\nand Transportation of Mexico) (which we refer to as \u201cSCT\u201d), which are responsible for regulating railroad services in Mexico, prior to the effective\ntime. The notice process is for informational purposes only, and no approval is required from either ARTF or SCT to consummate the transaction.\nMexican Rail Union\nKCS has provided an informal notification to the Mexican rail union\u037e no approval on the part of the Mexican rail union is required in order to\nconsummate the transaction.\nFCC\nKCS is subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cFCC\u201d) under the Communications Act of 1934,\nas amended. FCC approval of the transfer of KCS\u2019s FCC licenses will\n14\nTable of Contents\nbe required. Failure to receive FCC approval prior to transferring control of the FCC licenses could result in civil fines, revocation of the subject\nlicenses, and/or other remedial actions by the FCC. Initial approval from the FCC is expected before closing into the voting trust.\nIn October 2021, CPRL and KCS filed the required applications for FCC consent to the transfer of control of the subject licenses held by KCS from\nKCS to the voting trust. In November 2021, CPRL and KCS anticipate that applications to transfer control of KCS as lessee or sublessee of certain\nFCC licenses will be filed. While CPRL and KCS believe that FCC approval will ultimately be obtained, this approval is not assured.\nAdditionally, if the transaction is consummated, then the FCC will also preside over a similar post-closing approval process. CPRL and KCS\nanticipate, but cannot guarantee, that the FCC will ultimately approve this post-closing transfer of control of the FCC licenses. CPRL and KCS are\nnot aware of any cases where FCC approval did not follow STB approval.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the regulatory approvals required for the transaction, see the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction,\u201d on page 110.\nTreatment of KCS Equity Awards (page 141)",

            "text": "Risks Relating to the Transaction\nBecause the exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of shares of CPRL common shares has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, KCS\nstockholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive in the transaction prior to the closing of the transaction.\nAt the effective time, each share of KCS common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as\ndescribed in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive 2.884 CPRL common shares and $90.00 in cash, without interest. Because the\nexchange ratio is fixed, the value of the share consideration will depend on the market price of CPRL common shares at the effective time. The market price\nof CPRL common shares has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the transaction and is expected to continue to fluctuate from the date of\nthis proxy statement/prospectus until the closing date, which could occur a considerable amount of time after the date hereof. Changes in the price of\nCPRL common shares may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in CPRL\u2019s and\nKCS\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, risks inherent in their respective businesses, changes in market assessments of the likelihood\nthat the proposed acquisition will be completed and/or the value that may be generated by the proposed acquisition and changes with respect to\nexpectations regarding the timing of the proposed acquisition and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond KCS\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s\ncontrol.\nThe CPRL common shares to be received by holders of KCS common stock at the effective time will have different rights from shares of KCS common\nstock.\nAt the effective time, holders of KCS common stock will no longer be stockholders of KCS but will instead become shareholders of CPRL. The rights of\nformer holders of KCS common stock as stockholders will then be governed by Canadian law and by the terms of CPRL\u2019s articles of incorporation and by-\nlaws, which are in some respects materially different than the terms of KCS\u2019s certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which currently govern the rights of\nKCS stockholders. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cComparison of Rights of CPRL Shareholders and KCS Stockholders,\u201d\non page 195 for a discussion of the different rights associated with CPRL common shares and KCS common stock.\nThe transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder/shareholder approvals as well as other uncertainties,\nand there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.\nClosing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions specified in the merger agreement, and it is possible that such\nconditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely\n22Table of Contents\naffect the completion of the transaction. These conditions include, among other things: (1) receipt of the KCS stockholder approval\u037e (2) receipt of the\nCPRL shareholder approval\u037e (3) effectiveness of the Form F-4 (of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part) in accordance with the provisions\nof the U.S. Securities Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Form F-4 having been issued and remaining in effect and no proceeding\nto that effect having been commenced\u037e (4) the absence of any injunction or similar order prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transaction\nor the voting trust transaction\u037e (5) approval by COFECE and the IFT of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e (6) the CPRL common\nshares issuable in the first merger having been approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and the TSX, subject to customary\nlisting requirements\u037e (7) the accuracy of each party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the merger\nagreement\u037e (8) compliance by each party in all material respects with such party\u2019s obligations under the merger agreement\u037e and (9) with respect to CPRL,\nthe absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect, and with respect to KCS, the absence of a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as such terms are defined\nin the merger agreement).\nThe governmental authorities from which authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may\ntake into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These governmental\nauthorities may initiate proceedings or otherwise seek to prevent the transaction. As a condition to authorization of the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the\nconduct of CPRL\u2019s business after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or\nwaived, if applicable), and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we cannot\nprovide any assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the transaction. Many of\nthe conditions to completion of the transaction are not within either KCS\u2019s or CPRL\u2019s control, and neither company can predict when or if these\nconditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in completing the transaction could cause KCS and/or CPRL not to realize some or all of\nthe benefits that each expects to achieve if the transaction is successfully completed within the expected timeframe.\nIn order to complete the transaction, CPRL and KCS must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are\ngranted with conditions that become applicable to the parties, completion of the transaction may be delayed, jeopardized or prevented and the\nanticipated benefits of the transaction could be reduced.\nNo assurance can be given that the required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to the completion of the\ntransaction will be satisfied. Even if all such consents, orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as\nto the terms, conditions and timing of such consents, orders and approvals. For example, these consents, orders and approvals may impose conditions\non or require divestitures relating to the divisions, operations or assets of KCS and CPRL or may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place\nrestrictions on the conduct of KCS\u2019s or CPRL\u2019s business, and if such consents, orders and approvals require an extended period of time to be obtained,\nsuch extended period of time could increase the chance that an adverse event occurs with respect to KCS or CPRL. Such extended period of time also\nmay increase the chance that other adverse effects with respect to KCS or CPRL could occur, such as the loss of key personnel. Even if all necessary\napprovals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals. For more information, see the sections\nentitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions that Must be\nSatisfied or Waived for the Transaction to Occur,\u201d on pages 110 and 141, respectively.\nThe KCS special meeting may take place before all of the required regulatory approvals have been obtained and before all conditions to such approvals, if\nany, are known. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the KCS merger\n23\nTable of Contents\nproposal is approved by KCS stockholders, KCS may not be required to seek further approval of KCS stockholders.\nAfter CPRL\u2019s combination with KCS following receipt of STB approval, CPRL may fail to realize projected benefits and cost savings of the\ncombination, which could adversely affect the value of CPRL common shares.\nCPRL and KCS have operated and, until the receipt of STB final approval, will continue to operate (even while the voting trust is in effect), independently.\nThe success of CPRL\u2019s combination with KCS will depend, in part, on CPRL\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining the\nbusinesses of KCS and CPRL following the (which we refer to as the \u201ccontrol date\u201d), including operational and other synergies that we believe the\ncombined company will achieve. The anticipated benefits and synergies of CPRL\u2019s combination with KCS may not be realized fully or at all, may take\nlonger to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that we have made, such as\nthe achievement of operating synergies, may not be realized. The integration process may, for KCS and CPRL, result in the loss of key employees, the\ndisruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. There could be potential unknown liabilities and\nunforeseen expenses associated with the transaction that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence. Coordinating certain aspects of\nthe operations and personnel of CPRL with KCS after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval will involve complex\noperational, technological and personnel-related challenges, which may be made more difficult in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the\nintegration will require significant time and focus from management following the combination which may disrupt the business of the combined company.\nThe announcement and pendency of the transaction could adversely affect each of KCS\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe announcement and pendency of the transaction could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding KCS\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s business,\nincluding affecting KCS\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s relationships with its existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect\non KCS\u2019s or CPRL\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the transaction is completed. In particular, KCS and\nCPRL could potentially lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the\ntransaction. KCS and CPRL could also potentially lose customers or suppliers, and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased.\nThe attention of KCS\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s respective management may be directed towards closing the transaction, including obtaining regulatory approvals\nand other transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of KCS and CPRL and matters related to the\ntransaction may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been\nbeneficial to KCS and CPRL. Additionally, the merger agreement requires each party to obtain the other party\u2019s consent prior to taking certain specified\nactions while the transaction is pending. These restrictions may prevent CPRL and KCS from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities prior\nto the closing of the transaction, and in some cases for KCS, completion of the combination. Any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses\nof, or harm the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of CPRL and the market value of CPRL common shares.\nIf the transaction does not close, the prices of KCS common stock and CPRL common shares may fall to the extent that the current prices of KCS common\nstock and CPRL common shares reflect a market assumption that the transaction will close. In addition, the failure to close the transaction may result in\nnegative publicity or a negative impression of KCS in the investment community and may affect KCS\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s relationship with employees,\ncustomers, suppliers and other partners in the business community.\nKCS and CPRL will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the transaction.\nKCS and CPRL have incurred and expect to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement, including costs relating to obtaining required approvals\n24\nTable of Contents\nand, in the case of KCS, compensation payments to its executives triggered by the change in control of KCS as a result of the transaction. KCS and CPRL\nhave incurred significant financial services, accounting, tax and legal fees in connection with the process of negotiating and evaluating the terms of the\ntransaction. Additional significant unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of coordinating and combining the businesses of KCS and CPRL\nfollowing receipt of STB final approval. Even if the transaction does not close, KCS and CPRL will need to pay certain costs relating to the transaction\nincurred prior to the date the transaction was abandoned, such as financial advisory, accounting, tax, legal, filing and printing fees. Such costs may be\nsignificant and could have an adverse effect on the parties\u2019 future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition to its own fees\nand expenses, if the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, KCS will be required to pay to CPRL a $700.0 million termination\npayment and/or the $700.0 million CN termination amount refund. In addition to its own fees and expenses, if the merger agreement is terminated under\nspecified circumstances, CPRL may be required to pay either $700.0 million or $1.0 billion to KCS, depending on the reason for the termination. For more\ninformation, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement,\u201d on page 164.\nSignificant demands will be placed on CPRL and KCS as a result of the combination of the two companies.\nAs a result of the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval, significant demands will be placed on the managerial, operational\nand financial personnel and systems of CPRL and KCS. CPRL and KCS cannot assure you that their respective systems, procedures and controls will be\nadequate to support the expansion of operations following and resulting from the combination of the two companies. The future operating results of the\ncombined company will be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and\nexpand its operational and financial controls and reporting systems in response to the transaction.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information of KCS and CPRL is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be\nindicative of the results of operations or financial condition of the combined company following the combination of CPRL and KCS following\nreceipt of STB final approval.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus has been prepared using the\nconsolidated historical financial statements of CPRL and KCS, is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered to be an\nindication of the results of operations or financial condition of the combined company after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB\nfinal approval. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus is based in\npart on certain assumptions regarding the transaction. These assumptions may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the combined\ncompany\u2019s results of operations or financial condition following the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval. Accordingly,\nthe historical information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial\ninformation included in this proxy statement/prospectus does not necessarily represent the combined company\u2019s results of operations and financial\ncondition had KCS and CPRL operated as a combined entity during the periods presented, or of the combined company\u2019s results of operations and\nfinancial condition after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval. The combined company\u2019s potential for future business\nsuccess and operating profitability must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties typically encountered by recently\ncombined companies.\nIn preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, CPRL has given effect\nto, among other items, the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval, the payment of the merger consideration and the\npreferred merger consideration and the indebtedness of CPRL on a consolidated basis after giving effect to the combination of CPRL and KCS following\nreceipt of STB final approval, including the indebtedness of KCS. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information may not reflect\nall of the costs that are expected to be incurred by KCS and CPRL in connection with the transaction. For more information, see the section entitled\n25\nTable of Contents\n\u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information,\u201d on page 171, including the notes thereto.\nThe substantial additional indebtedness that CP will incur in connection with the transaction could adversely affect CP\u2019s (and after the combination\nof CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval, the combined company\u2019s) financial position, including by decreasing its business\nflexibility, ability to satisfy its debt obligations and credit ratings.\nAfter the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval, the combined company will have substantially increased borrowings\ncompared to CP\u2019s historical level of borrowings. CP\u2019s consolidated borrowings were approximately C$10.0 billion (U.S.$7.8 billion converted at the Bank of\nCanada exchange rate on September 30, 2021) as at September 30, 2021. The combined company\u2019s pro forma borrowings as at September 30, 2021, if the\nacquisition of KCS had been completed on that same date, would have been approximately U.S.$20.1 billion, of which U.S.$9.0 billion would have been at\nvariable rates of interest when assuming borrowings for the transaction are made under the bridge facility.\nCP expects to incur approximately U.S.$12.3 billion of additional debt in connection with the transaction relative to debt balances outstanding as at\nSeptember 30, 2021, as a result of obtaining financing to complete the transaction and refinancing of debt assumed in the transaction as required. Also, in\nconnection with the transaction, the existing indebtedness of KCS is expected to remain outstanding to the extent the transaction closes into the voting\ntrust. This increased level of borrowings could have the effect, among other things, of reducing CP\u2019s liquidity and the combined company\u2019s flexibility to\nrespond to changing business and economic conditions. Also, the combined company\u2019s ability to make payments of principal and interest on its\nindebtedness will depend upon its future performance, which will be subject to general economic, financial and business conditions, sufficient cash flow\nfrom KCS during the period in which it is in the voting trust, the implementation of the integration with KCS and other factors affecting its operations,\nmany of which will be beyond the combined company\u2019s control.\nAccordingly, the amount of cash required to service the combined company\u2019s increased borrowing levels and increased aggregate dividends after the\ncombination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval, and thus the demands on the combined company\u2019s cash resources, will be greater\nthan the amount of cash flows required to service CP\u2019s borrowings and pay dividends prior to the combination. If CP completes the acquisition of KCS\nand obtains control of KCS but CP does not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the acquisition, or if the financial performance of the\ncombined company does not meet current expectations, then CP\u2019s ability to service CP\u2019s indebtedness may be adversely impacted. The increased levels\nof borrowings and dividends after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval could also reduce funds available for the\ncombined company\u2019s investments in research and development and capital expenditures and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages\nfor the combined company relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nThe agreements that will govern CP\u2019s indebtedness that would be incurred in connection with the acquisition of KCS may contain various affirmative and\nnegative covenants that may, subject to certain customary exceptions, restrict the combined company\u2019s ability to, among other things, create liens over\nits property, change its line of business and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of its assets to another person. In\naddition, some of the agreements that will govern the combined company\u2019s new debt financings may contain financial covenants that will require it to\nmaintain certain financial ratios. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond the combined company\u2019s control could affect its ability to comply with\nthese covenants and failure to comply with them could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate repayment\nobligations. Under these circumstances, the combined company may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations.\nCP\u2019s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, CP\u2019s cost of capital. CP\u2019s credit ratings reflect each credit rating\norganization\u2019s opinion of CP\u2019s financial and business strength,\n26\nTable of Contents\noperating performance and ability to meet CP\u2019s debt obligations. If any of CP\u2019s credit ratings are reduced, CP may not be able to sell additional debt\nsecurities, borrow money, refinance the transaction facilities if drawn or establish alternatives to the transaction facilities in the amounts, at the times or\ninterest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if CP\u2019s current credit ratings are maintained.\nIn addition, future borrowings under circumstances in which the combined company\u2019s debt is rated below investment grade may contain further\nrestrictions that impose significant restrictions on the way the combined company operates after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of\nSTB final approval.\nCPRL or KCS may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting shareholder approval or stockholder approval, respectively.\nCertain conditions to CPRL\u2019s and KCS\u2019s obligations, respectively, to close the transaction may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally\npermissible, either unilaterally or by agreement of CPRL and KCS. In the event that any such waiver does not require re-solicitation of CPRL\u2019s\nshareholders or an amendment of this proxy statement/prospectus or any re-solicitation of proxies or voting cards, as applicable, the parties will have the\ndiscretion to close the transaction without seeking further approval of CPRL shareholders or KCS stockholders, as applicable.\nThe opinions of KCS\u2019s financial advisors rendered to the KCS board do not reflect changes in circumstances between the signing of the merger\nagreement and the closing of the transaction.\nThe KCS board has received opinions from Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities, KCS\u2019s financial advisors, dated September 15, 2021, to the effect that, as\nof the date of the opinions and based on and subject to assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on\nthe scope of review undertaken by each financial advisor as described in the written opinions, the merger consideration to be received pursuant to the\nmerger agreement by holders of KCS common stock (other than excluded shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, but has not\nobtained updated opinions as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Changes in the operations and prospects of CPRL or KCS, general market\nand economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of CPRL or KCS, and on which the forecasts and assumptions used by KCS\u2019s\nfinancial advisors in connection with rendering their respective opinions may have been based, may significantly alter the value of CPRL or KCS or the\nprices of the CPRL common shares or of the shares of KCS common stock by the time the transaction is completed. Each opinion did not speak as of the\ntime the transaction will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion and the KCS board does not anticipate asking its financial\nadvisors to update their respective opinions. The KCS board\u2019s recommendation that KCS stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the KCS merger\nproposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the non-binding compensation advisory proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS adjournment proposal, however, is made as of the date of this\nproxy statement/prospectus.\nFor a description of the opinions that the KCS board received from its financial advisors, see the sections entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Opinion\nof BofA Securities\u201d and \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Opinion of Morgan Stanley\u201d on pages 85 and 72, respectively. Copies of the opinions of Morgan\nStanley and BofA Securities are attached as Annexes B and C to this proxy statement/prospectus and are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\nWhile the transaction is pending and during the pendency of the voting trust, KCS is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions\nthat could materially adversely affect KCS\u2019s operating results, financial position and/or cash flows or result in a loss of employees, suppliers,\nvendors or customers.\nThe merger agreement generally requires KCS to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary\ncourse prior to the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement and the control date. In addition, the merger agreement includes a variety of\nspecified restrictions on the conduct of\n27\nTable of Contents\nKCS\u2019s business, which, in the event the merger agreement is not earlier terminated, expire either on the closing date or the control date. Among other\nthings and subject to the other terms of the merger agreement and certain other exceptions and limitations, KCS may not, outside of the ordinary course\nof business, incur additional indebtedness, issue additional shares of KCS\u2019s common stock outside of its equity incentive plans, repurchase common\nstock, pay dividends, acquire assets, securities or property, dispose of businesses or assets, enter into certain material contracts or make certain\nadditional capital expenditures. KCS may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the merger agreement delay or prevent KCS from making\ncertain changes, or limit its ability to make certain changes, during such period, even if KCS\u2019s management believes that making certain changes may be\nadvisable. The pendency of the transaction may also divert management\u2019s attention and KCS\u2019s resources from ongoing business and operations.\nDuring the period in which KCS is in the voting trust, its existing revolving credit agreement will remain in place, which includes certain limitations on\ndividends and distributions to its shareholders, including CPRL at such time. Such limitations may restrict the combined company from receiving the full\nbenefit of the cash generated by KCS during such period.\nKCS\u2019s employees, suppliers, vendors or customers may experience uncertainties about the effects of the transaction. It is possible that some employees,\nsuppliers, vendors or customers and other parties with whom KCS has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might\ndecide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with KCS as a result of the proposed acquisition. Similarly, current and prospective\nemployees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with KCS following completion of the transaction, which may materially and adversely\naffect KCS\u2019s ability to attract and retain key employees. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact KCS\u2019s operating\nresults, financial position, cash flows and/or stock price.\nCP expects to refinance its credit facility entered into for the purpose of the transaction but cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain new\nfinancing on terms acceptable to it or at all.\nCP anticipates that the funds needed to consummate the transaction will be derived from a combination of some or all of: (i) cash on hand\u037e (ii) borrowings\nunder the credit facility which will be entered into for the purpose of the transaction, its existing credit facilities and/or new credit facilities\u037e and (iii) the\nproceeds from the sale of new debt securities and the issuance of any commercial paper. While CP intends to refinance the credit facility for which it has\nobtained commitments for the purpose of the transaction, CP\u2019s ability to obtain any new debt financing will depend on, among other factors, prevailing\nmarket conditions and other factors beyond CP\u2019s control. CP cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain new debt financing on terms acceptable to it\nor at all on or before the maturity date of its credit facilities, and therefore any such failure to refinance could materially adversely affect its operations and\nfinancial condition.\nIn particular, CP has entered into the commitment letter to backstop permanent debt financings to fund a portion of the cash consideration and preferred\nmerger consideration and transaction expenses. However, CP has not entered into definitive agreements for such debt financing, and the obligation of the\nlenders to provide the debt financing under the commitment letter is subject to a number of customary conditions. There can be no assurance that CP will\nbe able to obtain the debt financing under the commitment letter. In the event that the debt financing contemplated above is not available, other financing\nmay not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. If CP is unable to obtain debt financing, the transaction may be delayed or not be\ncompleted. CPRL\u2019s obligation to complete the transaction is not conditioned upon the receipt of any financing.\nCPRL\u2019s combination with KCS is subject to final approval by the STB, and there can be no assurance as to whether and when it may be approved or\nif such approval will be granted with conditions applicable to the parties\u037e accordingly, CPRL\u2019s combination with KCS may be delayed, jeopardized\nor prevented entirely and the anticipated benefits of the combination could be reduced.\nAlthough the STB has approved the proposed voting trust agreement, there can be no assurance that third parties will not ask the STB to reconsider that\napproval. The STB also has the authority to impose conditions on its\n28\nTable of Contents\napproval of a control transaction to alleviate competitive or other concerns, and, if such conditions are imposed, the anticipated benefits of the\ncombination of CPRL and KCS might be reduced. There is no assurance that STB final approval will be obtained or obtained on terms acceptable to CPRL.\nIn addition, under existing law, railroad competitors of CPRL and KCS and other interested parties may intervene to oppose the STB application or seek\nprotective conditions in the event approval by the STB is granted, which might delay the approval process or reduce the anticipated benefits of the\ncombination of CPRL and KCS. Furthermore, if the STB does not provide STB final approval or imposes conditions on its approval in a final order, and\nCPRL and KCS decide to appeal such final order from the STB, any such appeal might not be resolved for a substantial period of time after the entry of\nsuch order by the STB.\nIf either (i) STB final approval has not been obtained by December 31, 2023 or (ii) the STB has, by a final and non-appealable order, refused to provide\nSTB final approval (which we refer to collectively as an \u201cSTB denial\u201d), CPRL would be required to dispose of its initial investment in KCS. Similarly, if the\nSTB imposes onerous conditions on STB final approval, CPRL may choose to dispose of its initial investment in KCS rather than agreeing to the\nconditions imposed by the STB. In either case, CPRL would be obligated under the voting trust agreement to directly or indirectly divest of the trust\nstock in a manner that is acceptable to the STB. CPRL and KCS expect that, in case of a divestiture, the market and divestiture alternatives for the trust\nstock might be limited, and such a disposition could cause CPRL to incur significant losses and expenses in connection with the transaction, which could\nhave a significant adverse impact on the business and financial condition of CPRL.\nFailure by KCS to successfully execute its business strategy and objectives may materially adversely affect the future results of the combined\ncompany and, consequently, the market value of CPRL common shares.\nThe success of the combination of CPRL and KCS will depend, in part, on the ability of KCS to successfully execute its business strategy, including\nmaking deliveries in a safe and reliable manner, minimizing service interruptions and investing in its infrastructure to maintain its rail system and serve its\ncustomer base. These objectives are capital intensive. Furthermore, KCS\u2019s business strategy, operations and plans for growth and expansion rely\nsignificantly on agreements with other railroads and third parties, including joint ventures and other strategic alliances, as well as interchange, trackage\nrights, haulage rights and marketing agreements with other railroads and third parties that enable KCS to exchange traffic and utilize trackage that it does\nnot own. KCS\u2019s ability to provide comprehensive rail service to its customers depends in large part upon its ability to maintain these agreements with\nother railroads and third parties, and upon the performance of the obligations under the agreements by the other railroads and third parties. The\ntermination of, or the failure to renew, these agreements could have a material adverse effect on KCS\u2019s consolidated financial statements and interfere\nwith its business strategy, operations and plans for growth. If KCS is not able to achieve its business strategy, is not able to achieve its business strategy\non a timely basis, or otherwise fails to perform in accordance with CPRL\u2019s expectations, the anticipated benefits of the combination of CPRL and KCS may\nnot be realized fully or at all, and the combination may materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the\ncombined company and, consequently, the market value of CPRL common shares.\nFailure to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement could negatively impact the price of KCS voting stock, and future\nbusiness and financial results.\nIf the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not completed for any reason, including as a result of the failure to obtain the KCS\nstockholder approval or the CPRL shareholder approval, KCS\u2019s ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and KCS would be subject to\na number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nKCS may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on trading prices of KCS common stock, and\nfrom KCS\u2019s employees, suppliers, vendors, regulators or customers\u037e\n29\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nKCS will be required to pay CPRL a termination payment of $700.0 million, in consideration for the disposition by CPRL of its contractual\nrights under the merger agreement, if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including because the KCS board has\nchanged its recommendation in favor of the transaction or in certain circumstances where, after the date of the merger agreement, KCS\nenters into an agreement providing for an alternative proposal (for these purposes, substituting in the definition of alternative proposal\n\u201c50%\u201d for \u201c25%\u201d and for \u201c75%\u201d in each place each such phrase appears, and such proposal, a \u201cqualifying transaction\u201d) in respect of KCS\nthat is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not publicly withdrawn at least two business days prior to, the KCS special\nmeeting following termination of the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nKCS will be required to pay to CPRL the $700.0 million CN termination amount refund if the merger agreement is terminated in certain\ncircumstances, including (i) by KCS prior to receipt of the KCS stockholder approval, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing\nfor a superior proposal in respect of KCS\u037e (ii) by CPRL on the basis of a breach by KCS of its representations, warranties, covenants or\nother agreements contained in the merger agreement\u037e or (iii) by CPRL because the KCS board has effected a change of recommendation\u037e\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of KCS\u2019s business, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to\nthe consent of CPRL, may prevent KCS from making certain material acquisitions, entering into or amending certain contracts, taking certain\nother specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the transaction or, with respect to certain\nactions, prior to the control date, that KCS would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place\u037e and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the transaction (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by KCS\u2019s\nmanagement and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-\nto-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to KCS as an independent company.\nIn addition, KCS could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the acquisition or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce KCS\u2019s\nperformance obligations under the merger agreement.\nIf any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect KCS\u2019s business, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.\nDirectors and executive officers of KCS have interests in the transaction that may differ from the interests of KCS stockholders generally, including,\nif the transaction is completed, the receipt of financial and other benefits.\nIn considering the recommendations of the KCS board, KCS stockholders should be aware that KCS\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in\nthe transaction that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of KCS stockholders generally. These interests may include, among others, the\ntreatment of outstanding KCS equity awards under the merger agreement, the potential payment of severance benefits and acceleration of outstanding\nKCS equity awards upon certain terminations of employment, retention awards and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage. These\ninterests are described in more detail in the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Interests of KCS\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nTransaction,\u201d on page 102.\nExcept in specified circumstances, if the effective time has not occurred by the end date, either KCS or CPRL may choose not to proceed with the\ntransaction.\nEither KCS or CPRL may terminate the merger agreement if the effective time has not occurred by February 21, 2022 (i.e., the end date)\u037e provided, that to\nthe extent the condition to obtain the authorizations required to be obtained from COFECE and the IFT with respect to the transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement has\n30\nTable of Contents\nnot been satisfied or waived on or prior to February 21, 2022, but all other conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived (except for those\nconditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing), the end date will be automatically extended to May 21, 2022. However, this right to\nterminate the merger agreement will not be available to KCS or CPRL if such party has breached in any material respect its obligations under the merger\nagreement in any manner that has been the primary cause of the failure to consummate the transaction on or before the end date. For more information,\nsee the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement,\u201d on page 164.\nThere may be less publicly available information concerning CPRL than there is for issuers that are not foreign private issuers because, as a foreign\nprivate issuer, CPRL is exempt from a number of rules under the U.S. Exchange Act and is permitted to file less information with the SEC than\nissuers that are not foreign private issuers and CPRL, as a foreign private issuer, is permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the listing\nrequirements of NYSE, subject to certain exceptions.\nFor so long as CPRL remains a foreign private issuer under the U.S. Exchange Act, CPRL is exempt from certain rules under the U.S. Exchange Act.\nAlthough CPRL has chosen to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC, CPRL is\ncurrently not required to do so. CPRL is also not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as\ncompanies whose securities are registered under the U.S. Exchange Act but are not foreign private issuers, or to comply with Regulation FD, which\nrestricts the selective disclosure of material non-public information. In addition, CPRL is exempt from certain disclosure and procedural requirements\napplicable to proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the U.S. Exchange Act. The members of the CPRL board, officers and principal shareholders are\nexempt from the reporting and \u201cshort-swing\u201d profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, there may be less publicly\navailable information concerning CPRL than there is for companies whose securities are registered under the U.S. Exchange Act but are not foreign\nprivate issuers, and such information may not be provided as promptly as it is provided by such companies. In addition, certain information may be\nprovided by CPRL in accordance with Canadian law, which may differ in substance or timing from such disclosure requirements under the U.S. Exchange\nAct. For example, disclosure with respect to CPRL annual meetings of shareholders will be governed by Canadian law. Further, as a foreign private issuer,\nunder NYSE rules CPRL is subject to less stringent corporate governance requirements, although CPRL\u2019s current corporate governance practices are\nconsistent with all applicable Canadian and U.S. regulatory guidelines and standards. Subject to certain exceptions, the rules of NYSE permit a foreign\nprivate issuer to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of NYSE, including, for example, certain internal controls as well as\nboard, committee and director independence requirements. CPRL is required to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices\ndiffer from those followed by U.S. domestic companies under NYSE listing standards in its annual report filed with the SEC or on its website. Accordingly,\nCPRL shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are required to comply with all of the NYSE corporate\ngovernance requirements.\nCPRL is organized under the laws of Canada and a substantial portion of its assets are, and many of its directors and officers reside, outside of the\nU.S. As a result, it may not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. against CPRL, its officers,\nor members of the CPRL board.\nCPRL is organized under the laws of Canada. A substantial portion of CPRL\u2019s assets are located outside the U.S., and many of CPRL\u2019s directors and\nofficers and some of the experts named in this proxy statement/prospectus are residents of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and the assets of such\npersons may be located outside of the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service within the U.S. upon CPRL and those directors,\nofficers and experts, or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against CPRL or such persons either inside or outside of the U.S., or to enforce in\nU.S. courts judgments obtained against CPRL or such persons in courts in jurisdictions outside the U.S., in any action predicated upon the civil liability\nprovisions of the federal securities laws of the U.S.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThere is no certainty that civil liabilities predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the U.S. can be enforced in Canada, whether by original\naction or by seeking to enforce a judgment of U.S. courts. In addition, punitive damages awards in actions brought in the U.S. or elsewhere may be\nunenforceable in Canada.\nResales of CPRL common shares following the transaction may cause the market value of CPRL common shares to decline.\nBased on the number of shares of KCS common stock, KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred stock outstanding as of October 29, 2021,\nCPRL expects to issue (at the direction of surviving merger sub and on behalf of surviving merger sub) up to approximately 262,637,917 CPRL common\nshares at the effective time in connection with the transaction. The issuance of these new CPRL common shares could have the effect of depressing the\nmarket value for CPRL common shares. The increase in the number of CPRL common shares may lead to sales of such CPRL common shares or the\nperception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market value of, CPRL common shares.\nThe market value of CPRL common shares may decline as a result of the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval.\nThe market value of CPRL common shares may decline as a result of the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval if, among\nother things, the combined company is unable to achieve the expected growth in revenues and earnings, or if the operational cost savings estimates in\nconnection with the integration of KCS\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s businesses are not realized or if the transaction costs related to the transaction are greater than\nexpected. The market value of CPRL common shares also may decline if the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the\ncombination as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the market or if the effect of the combination on the combined company\u2019s financial position, results\nof operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. In addition, some KCS common stockholders may\ndecide not to continue to hold the CPRL common shares they receive as a result of the transaction, and any such sales of CPRL common shares could\nhave the effect of depressing their market price. Moreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or\nliquidity of, CPRL common shares, regardless of CPRL\u2019s actual operating performance after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB\nfinal approval.\nCurrent CPRL shareholders and KCS common stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the transaction and will exercise\nless influence over the management of the combined company.\nBased on the number of shares of KCS common stock, KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred stock outstanding as of October 29, 2021,\nat the effective time, CPRL expects to issue (at the direction of surviving merger sub and on behalf of surviving merger sub) up to approximately\n262,637,917 CPRL common shares at the effective time in connection with the transaction. As a result, it is expected that, immediately after the effective\ntime, former KCS common stockholders would own approximately 28% of the outstanding CPRL common shares. See the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Treatment of KCS Equity Awards,\u201d on page 141 for a more detailed explanation. Consequently,\ncurrent CPRL shareholders in the aggregate will have less influence over the management and policies of the combined company than they currently have\nover the management and policies of CPRL, and KCS common stockholders in the aggregate will have significantly less influence over the management\nand policies of the combined company than they currently have over the management and policies of KCS.\nKCS and CPRL may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the\ntransaction from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the\nlawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a\nplaintiff is successful in obtaining\n32\nTable of Contents\nan injunction prohibiting consummation of the transaction, then that injunction may delay or prevent the transaction from being completed.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business and\noperations.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation from stockholders, customers, suppliers, consumers and other third parties due to the\ncombination of CPRL\u2019s business and KCS\u2019s business following receipt of STB final approval. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on the\ncombined company\u2019s business and results of operations or may cause disruptions to the combined company\u2019s operations.\nIf the transaction is not treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or if the requirements of Section 367(a) of the Code are\nnot met, holders of KCS common stock may be required to recognize a greater amount of gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon their\nexchange shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration.\nAlthough KCS\u2019s obligation to complete the transaction is conditioned on its receipt of an opinion from external counsel, to the effect that, on the basis of\nfacts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the transaction will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of\nSection 368(a) of the Code and that Section 367(a)(1) of the Code will not generally apply to cause the transaction to result in gain recognition to holders\nof KCS common stock (other than excepted shareholders), neither CPRL nor KCS has applied for, or expects to obtain, a ruling from the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that\nthe IRS will agree with the conclusions reached in such opinion or that it will not challenge the intended U.S. federal income tax consequences of the\ntransaction. If the transaction were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders (as defined below in the section\nentitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,\u201d on page 120) of KCS common stock would recognize gain or\nloss on their exchange of KCS common stock for the merger consideration. If the transaction qualified as a reorganization but were to fail to satisfy the\nrequirements of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, U.S. holders of KCS common stock would be required to recognize the full amount of any gain, but not\nloss, on their exchange of KCS common stock for the merger consideration.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S. holders, see the section entitled \u201cThe KCS\nMerger Proposal\u2014Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,\u201d on page 120.\nThe IRS may not agree that CPRL should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation generally will be considered to be a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes only if it\nis created or organized in the U.S. or under the law of the U.S. or of any State. Accordingly, under generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rules, CPRL,\nwhich is organized under the laws of Canada, would generally be classified as a foreign corporation. Section 7874 of the Code and the Treasury\nRegulations promulgated thereunder, however, contain specific rules that may cause a foreign corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes (or to be subject to certain other adverse tax consequences). CPRL believes that it should not be treated as a U.S. corporation\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code immediately following the transaction. There can be no assurance, however, that the\nIRS will not take a contrary position or that the relevant U.S. federal income tax law will not be changed (possibly with retroactive effect) in a manner that\nwould result in a contrary conclusion. If it were determined that CPRL is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section\n7874 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, CPRL could be subject to substantial U.S. tax liability and its non-U.S.\nshareholders could be subject to U.S. withholding tax on any dividends.\n33\nTable of Contents\nCPRL and KCS may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the combination of CPRL\nand KCS.\nUncertainty about the effect of the transaction on CPRL and KCS employees may have an adverse effect on each of CPRL and KCS separately and\nconsequently the combined company. This uncertainty may impair CPRL\u2019s and/or KCS\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee\nretention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the transaction, as employees of CPRL and KCS may experience uncertainty about their\nfuture roles in the combined company.\nAdditionally, KCS\u2019s officers and employees may hold shares of KCS voting stock, and, if the transaction closes, these officers and employees may be\nentitled to the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, in respect of such shares of KCS voting stock. Under agreements\nbetween KCS and certain of its key employees, such employees could potentially resign from employment on or after the effective time following\nspecified circumstances constituting good reason or constructive termination (as set forth in the applicable agreement) that could result in severance\npayments to such employees and accelerated vesting of their equity awards. These payments and accelerated vesting benefits, individually or in the\naggregate, could make retention of KCS key employees more difficult.\nFurthermore, if key employees of CPRL or KCS depart or are at risk of departing, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of\nintegration, financial security or a desire not to become employees of the combined company, CPRL may have to incur significant costs in retaining such\nindividuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent, and the combined\ncompany\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction may be materially and adversely affected. No assurance can be given that the\ncombined company will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent that CP and KCS have been able to attract or retain employees in the\npast.\nFollowing the control date, it is expected that the board of directors of the combined company and the Management Resources and Compensation\nCommittee of the combined company (or such other committee(s) with responsibility for compensation matters) will meet to determine and oversee the\ncompensation of the independent Board Chair and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and the director and executive\ncompensation structure and policies of the combined company. These are anticipated to generally be consistent with the existing executive compensation\nstructure and policies of CPRL and may include long-term performance based equity awards such as PSUs and/or stock options tied to the expected\nsynergies of the combined company. To assess and determine the executive and director compensation structure and policies of the combined company,\nthe board of directors of the combined company and the combined company\u2019s Management Resources and Compensation Committee may retain and use\nreports prepared by independent compensation advisors or consultants.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for CPRL and KCS to pursue alternatives to the transaction and may\ndiscourage other companies from trying to acquire KCS for greater consideration than what CPRL has agreed to pay.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for KCS to sell its business to a party other than CPRL, or for CPRL to sell its\nbusiness. These provisions include a general prohibition on each party soliciting any alternative proposal. Further, there are only limited circumstances in\nwhich KCS may terminate the merger agreement to accept an alternative proposal and limited exceptions to each party\u2019s agreement that its board of\ndirectors will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other party the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement. In the event that the KCS board makes an adverse recommendation change, then KCS may be required to pay to CPRL a termination\npayment of $700.0 million and the CN termination amount refund of $700.0 million. In the event that the CPRL board makes an adverse recommendation\nchange, then CPRL may be required to pay to KCS a termination payment of $700.0 million. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation\u201d and \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement,\u201d on pages 151 and 164, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe parties believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers, but these restrictions might discourage a third party that has an\ninterest in acquiring all or a significant part of either KCS or CPRL from considering or proposing an alternative proposal.\nIf an alternative proposal to acquire KCS is made, consummation of the transaction may be delayed.\nIf an alternative proposal to acquire KCS is made, the attention of KCS\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s respective management may be diverted away from the transaction,\nwhich may delay or impede consummation of the transaction. Matters related to such alternative proposal, including any potential related litigation, may\nrequire commitments of time and resources of both parties and their respective representatives, which could otherwise have been devoted to the\ntransaction.\nThe financial forecasts are based on various assumptions that may not be realized.\nThe financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the sections entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014KCS Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information\u201d on page 97 were based on assumptions of, and information available to, the management team of KCS when prepared and these\nestimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of KCS and may not be realized. Many factors mentioned\nin this proxy statement/prospectus, including the risks outlined in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and the events or circumstances described under\n\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d will be important in determining the combined company\u2019s future results. As a result of\nthese contingencies, actual future results may vary materially from the estimates. In view of these uncertainties, the inclusion of financial estimates in this\nproxy statement/prospectus is not and should not be viewed as a representation that the forecasted results will necessarily reflect actual future results.\nThe financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the sections entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014KCS Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information\u201d on page 97 were based on assumptions that were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, and such financial estimates\nwere not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of any regulatory or professional body. Further, any forward-looking\nstatement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and KCS and CPRL do not undertake any obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to\nupdate the financial estimates in this proxy statement/prospectus to reflect events or circumstances after the date those financial estimates were prepared\nor to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. The prospective financial information included in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, KCS\u2019s management. This prospective financial information was not prepared\nwith a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. See \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014KCS Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information\u201d on page 97 for more information. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-\nupon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an\nopinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this document relates\nto KCS\u2019s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.\nExchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the foreign currency value of CPRL common shares and any dividends.\nCPRL common shares are quoted in Canadian dollars on the TSX and U.S. dollars on the NYSE. Dividends in respect of CPRL common shares, if any, are\nanticipated to be declared in Canadian dollars, consistent with CPRL\u2019s current dividend practice. CPRL\u2019s financial statements are prepared in Canadian\ndollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar will affect, among other matters, the U.S. dollar value of CPRL\ncommon shares and of any dividends in respect of such shares.\n35\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to KCS\u2019s Business",

The presence (including virtually) or representation by proxy, of the\nholders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the KCS capital stock issued and entitled to vote at the KCS special meeting will constitute a\nquorum. Shares of KCS voting stock represented at the KCS special meeting by attendance via the special meeting website or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote, but not voted, including shares for which a stockholder directs an \u201cabstention\u201d from voting, will be counted for purposes of determining\na quorum. However, because all of the KCS proposals are considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters under NYSE rules (as described below), shares held in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d will not be counted as present for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the stockholder provides their bank, broker or other\nnominee with voting instructions for at least one of the proposals before the KCS special meeting. If a quorum is not present, the KCS special meeting\nmay be adjourned or postponed until the holders of the number of shares of KCS voting stock required to constitute a quorum attend.\nUnder the NYSE rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d on behalf of the beneficial owner of such shares have the\nauthority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain \u201croutine\u201d proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial\nowners. However, banks, brokers or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters that under the NYSE rules,\nas applicable, are \u201cnon-routine.\u201d This can result in a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d, which occurs on an item when (i) a bank, broker or other nominee has\ndiscretionary authority to vote on one or more \u201croutine\u201d proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other\n\u201cnon-routine\u201d proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank, broker or\nother nominee with voting instructions on a \u201cnon-routine\u201d matter. All of the KCS proposals are considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters under the NYSE rules,\nand banks, brokers or other nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter before the meeting. As a result, KCS does not expect\nany broker non-votes at the KCS special meeting and, if you hold your shares of KCS voting stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d, your shares will not be represented\nand will not be voted on any matter unless you affirmatively instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the\nvoting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. It is therefore critical that you cast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or\nother nominee on how to vote.

            "text": "Merger Consideration\nUnder the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of KCS common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than\ncertain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) will be converted automatically into the right to receive the share consideration, being\n2.884 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable CPRL common shares and the cash consideration, being $90.00 in cash, without interest, and each\nshare of KCS preferred stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger\nagreement) will be converted into the right to receive the preferred merger consideration, being $37.50 in cash, without interest.\nThe merger consideration and/or the preferred merger consideration will be equitably adjusted in the event of any stock dividend, subdivision,\nreorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares involving KCS common stock, KCS\npreferred stock or CPRL common shares prior to the effective time, to proportionally reflect such change.\nAs used in this proxy statement/prospectus, the term \u201ctotal purchase consideration\u201d collectively refers to the merger consideration, the preferred merger\nconsideration, cash amounts payable at the effective time in respect of all KCS equity awards, amounts remitted by CPRL to KCS in connection with the\nCN agreement termination payment and CN refund, and other amounts as defined as consideration by the acquisition method of accounting.\nBased on the number of shares of KCS common stock, KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred shares outstanding as of October 29, 2021,\nCPRL expects to issue (at the direction of surviving merger sub and on behalf of surviving merger sub) up to approximately 262,637,917 CPRL common\nshares to KCS common stockholders at the effective time under the merger agreement. The actual number of CPRL common shares to be issued under the\nmerger agreement will be determined immediately prior to the effective time based on the exchange ratio, the number of shares of KCS common stock\noutstanding at such time and the number of KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred shares. Based on the number of shares of KCS\ncommon stock, KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred shares outstanding as of October 29, 2021, and the number of CPRL common\nshares outstanding as of October 29, 2021, immediately after the first merger, former KCS common stockholders are expected to own approximately 28% of\nthe issued and outstanding CPRL common shares.\nBased on the closing price of CPRL common shares of $72.71 on the NYSE on August 9, 2021, the last full trading day prior to that on which CPRL\nsubmitted a revised offer to acquire KCS, the implied value of the merger consideration to holders of KCS common stock was approximately $299.70 per\nshare of KCS common stock. The merger consideration provides a premium to KCS stockholders of approximately 34%, based on closing share price of\nCPRL common shares on August 9, 2021, and the unaffected closing price of KCS common stock on March 19, 2021, the last full trading day before the\npublic announcement of the prior CP merger agreement. The implied value of the merger consideration will fluctuate, however, as the market price of CPRL\ncommon shares fluctuates, because the merger consideration that is payable per share of KCS common stock is a fixed fraction of a CPRL common share.\nAs a result, the value of the merger consideration that KCS common stockholders will receive upon the closing of the transaction could be greater than,\nless than or the same as the value of the merger consideration on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the KCS special meeting.\nAccordingly, you are encouraged to obtain current share price quotations for KCS common stock and CPRL common shares before deciding how to vote\nwith respect to the approval of the merger agreement. KCS common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cKSU\u201d and CPRL common shares trade\non the NYSE and the TSX under the symbol \u201cCP.\u201d The price of CPRL common shares on the NYSE is reported in U.S. dollars, while the price of CPRL\ncommon shares on the TSX is reported in Canadian dollars.\n49Table of Contents\nBackground of the Transaction",

        "Background of the Transaction": {
            "text": "Background of the Transaction\nThe KCS board and senior management team periodically review and evaluate KCS\u2019s long-term strategy and the range of strategic opportunities that\nmight be available to it to strengthen KCS\u2019s business and to enhance stockholder value. As part of this ongoing evaluation, management maintains a\nlong-range plan (the \u201cKCS long-range plan\u201d), which is periodically updated and reviewed with the KCS board, that reflects management\u2019s financial and\nbusiness outlook for KCS over a ten-year period. In addition, the KCS board and management team have, from time to time in the past, discussed and\nconsidered the possibility of entering into strategic transactions with other parties.\nOn July 29, 2020, Patrick Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer of KCS, and Keith Creel, President and Chief Executive Officer of CPRL, had a\nlunch meeting at which they discussed a variety of industry topics. During this meeting, Mr. Creel raised whether KCS would be amenable to discussing a\nbusiness combination of CPRL and KCS. No further actions were taken by the KCS management team or board at the time with respect to Mr. Creel\u2019s\ninquiry.\nBeginning on July 31, 2020, several financial media outlets reported that an investor consortium was considering making a takeover proposal for KCS.\nFollowing these reports, the KCS board and senior management reached out to its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley, and its outside counsel, Wachtell,\nLipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d), to discuss the reports and the question of how KCS should respond if a proposal were made.\nOn August 11, 2020, the KCS board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Wachtell Lipton, to\ndiscuss the financial media reports and the possibility of a proposal, including the KCS board\u2019s fiduciary duties under Delaware law and preliminary\nperspectives on valuation for KCS based on the KCS long-range plan and Wall Street research analyst forecasts. Thereafter, KCS reached out to BofA\nSecurities to join Morgan Stanley as KCS\u2019s and the KCS board\u2019s financial advisor. KCS and the KCS board determined to engage both Morgan Stanley\nand BofA based on, among other things, each firm\u2019s overall reputation and experience as an investment banking firm, each firm\u2019s substantial experience in\nthe transportation sector, and the belief that having the benefit of both firms\u2019 advice would be in the best interests of KCS and its stockholders.\nOn August 17, 2020, Robert Druten, the Chairman of the KCS board, and Mr. Ottensmeyer received an unsolicited written proposal from an investor\nconsortium (\u201cParty A\u201d) to acquire KCS for $195.00 per share in cash. The proposal indicated that Party A intended to finance the acquisition through a\ncombination of equity financing and $6.5 billion in debt financing, and that Party A anticipated obtaining all regulatory approvals within four to six\nmonths of signing a definitive agreement. Messrs. Druten and Ottensmeyer notified the KCS board of the receipt of Party A\u2019s proposal and, later that day,\nMr. Ottensmeyer and Michael Upchurch, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of KCS, participated in a conversation with\nrepresentatives of Party A to discuss the terms of the proposal.\nA special meeting of the KCS board was convened on August 18, 2020, with members of senior management, and representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nWachtell Lipton, to discuss Party A\u2019s proposal and potential next steps. Representatives of Morgan Stanley shared their perspectives on the financial\nterms of Party A\u2019s proposal. Members of management also reviewed the KCS long-range plan and the opportunities and risks associated with executing\non KCS\u2019s long-term strategy. The KCS board discussed these considerations and perspectives and concluded that KCS should remain focused on its\nlong-term strategic plans and should not pursue Party A\u2019s proposal. Messrs. Ottensmeyer and Upchurch subsequently conveyed the KCS board\u2019s\nconclusion to representatives of Party A.\nOn August 21, 2020, Mr. Creel called Mr. Ottensmeyer to propose that CPRL and KCS consider entering into a merger-of-equals transaction in which KCS\nstockholders would receive consideration consisting solely of CPRL common shares, in an at-market transaction. Mr. Creel expressed his view that,\nrelative to the other Class 1 railroad companies, a transaction involving CPRL and KCS would likely face the least amount of\n50Table of Contents\nregulatory uncertainty given the companies\u2019 status as the two smallest Class 1 railroad companies in North America and their lack of geographic overlap.\nDuring the same week, a representative of Party A contacted Mr. Ottensmeyer to request a meeting to further discuss the possibility of a transaction.\nDuring the following week, Jean-Jacques Ruest, President and Chief Executive Officer of CN, contacted Mr. Ottensmeyer telephonically to note the\nfinancial media reports regarding a possible takeover proposal. Mr. Ruest stated that, if KCS was interested in a sale, CN would be interested in\ndiscussing such a transaction. No further actions were taken by the KCS management team or board to engage with CN at the time.\nOn August 28, 2020, the KCS board met with members of senior management and a representative of Wachtell Lipton. The KCS board discussed Party A\u2019s\nrequest for a meeting and instructed Mr. Ottensmeyer to accept the request. Representatives of KCS management then reviewed possible exchange ratios\nimplied by the historical trading prices of KCS common stock and CPRL common shares, as well as possible exchange ratios implied by the relative\ncontributions of various financial metrics of KCS and CPRL. The KCS board discussed potential responses and determined not to take action with\nrespect to CPRL\u2019s proposal at the time, pending Mr. Ottensmeyer\u2019s discussion with Party A and Party A\u2019s response. Mr. Ottensmeyer also described his\nconversation with Mr. Ruest of CN. In the days following the KCS board meeting, Messrs. Ottensmeyer and Upchurch had a discussion with\nrepresentatives of Party A with respect to Party A\u2019s interest in a possible transaction.\nOn August 31, 2020, Party A submitted an updated, unsolicited written proposal to acquire KCS for $208.00 per share in cash, subject otherwise to the\nsame terms and conditions set forth in Party A\u2019s August 17th proposal. The next day, Messrs. Ottensmeyer and Upchurch participated in a conversation\nwith representatives of Party A to discuss the updated proposal.\nA meeting of the KCS board was held on September 2, 2020, with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities\nand Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities discussed the terms of Party A\u2019s proposal and CPRL\u2019s proposal and\npresented preliminary perspectives on valuation for KCS based on the KCS long-range plan. After consideration of these and other factors, the KCS\nboard again concluded that KCS should remain focused on its long-term strategic plans and determined that KCS should not pursue either Party A\u2019s\nproposal or CPRL\u2019s proposal. The KCS board did, however, believe that KCS should engage in discussions with CPRL about possible commercial\nopportunities or arrangements that could be in both companies\u2019 interests. Thereafter, Mr. Ottensmeyer communicated the KCS board\u2019s conclusions to\nrepresentatives of Party A and to Mr. Creel.\nFrom September to November 2020, the KCS board continued to discuss and review KCS\u2019s long-term strategic plan and strategic opportunities in\nconsultation with senior management and KCS\u2019s external advisors. In addition, representatives of KCS and CPRL met on September 14 and 15, 2020 to\ndiscuss possible commercial opportunities or arrangements outside the context of a combination. The representatives of CPRL also provided their views\non a potential at-market combination of KCS and CPRL.\nOn September 23, 2020, the KCS board met with members of management to further analyze and consider KCS\u2019s financial and business outlook and\nstrategic options, including KCS\u2019s outlook as an independent company and an analysis of combinations with various other railroads. The KCS board also\ndiscussed the investor feedback received by KCS management following the publication of a September 9th financial media report that KCS had rejected\nthe acquisition proposal that had reportedly been made for $208.00 per share in cash.\nOn October 20, 2020, the KCS board convened a meeting for informational purposes with members of management and representatives of Morgan\nStanley, BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton to discuss various strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company. This included a discussion\nled by representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities regarding illustrative buyout and ability-to-pay analyses with respect to Party A and\nvarious railroads who could be potential buyers.\n51\nTable of Contents\nOn November 11, 2020, Mr. Ottensmeyer and Mr. Creel had a telephonic discussion on which they agreed that, given the political uncertainties following\nthe recent U.S. election and the fact that KCS and CPRL were each focused on closing the fiscal year and preparing for the upcoming earnings season,\nKCS and CPRL would discontinue their discussions regarding potential commercial opportunities at such time and potentially revisit the idea of a\nstrategic combination of the two companies in the future.\nOn November 17, 2020, Mr. Ottensmeyer received a call from a representative of another Class 1 railroad company expressing interest in a potential\nacquisition of a portion of KCS\u2019s assets. Mr. Ottensmeyer reported this conversation to the KCS board, but no further actions were taken by the KCS\nmanagement team or KCS board to engage with such railroad company.\nOn November 23, 2020, representatives of Party A contacted Mr. Ottensmeyer to inform him that Party A intended to submit a revised proposal to acquire\nKCS for $230.00 per share in cash, which Party A submitted later that day. The revised proposal noted that Party A had high confidence that it would be\nable to obtain firm commitments from its equity partners and lenders once the parameters of a transaction had been agreed upon.\nThe KCS board met on December 2, 2020, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and\nKCS\u2019s legal advisors, to discuss Party A\u2019s revised proposal and potential next steps. Mr. Upchurch discussed the KCS long-range plan and KCS\u2019s general\nstrategic positioning. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities provided their preliminary perspectives on valuation for KCS based on the\nKCS long-range plan. The KCS board discussed the terms of Party A\u2019s proposal and the possibility of contacting CPRL, and potentially other Class 1\nrailroads, to determine their interest in submitting a proposal to acquire KCS. The KCS board reviewed potential synergy estimates and the possible\nmerger consideration such parties could offer to KCS stockholders. The KCS board also discussed the timing and certainty of consummating a\ntransaction with a Class 1 railroad company in light of the regulatory framework for such a transaction. Among other things, the KCS board and\nmanagement team discussed the possibility of addressing potential uncertainties by employing a voting trust structure in which an acquiring Class 1\nrailroad would close the acquisition and immediately deposit the shares of KCS into an independent voting trust, with KCS stockholders receiving their\nmerger consideration at that time and prior to the acquiror\u2019s receipt of final control approval from the STB.\nAfter deliberation, the KCS board determined that Party A\u2019s proposal was not at a value that the KCS board was prepared to accept, but authorized\nmanagement to begin providing Party A with due diligence materials, subject to the execution of a mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement, so that\nParty A could have an opportunity to submit an improved proposal. The KCS board also directed Mr. Ottensmeyer to notify Mr. Creel that KCS was now\nconsidering a potential transaction and would be willing to consider an acquisition proposal from CPRL that contemplated a significant control premium\nand a voting trust structure to address timing and regulatory issues. After consideration of the risks associated with a broader outreach effort, the KCS\nboard determined not to contact other parties at the time and to revisit the question of reaching out to additional parties at a later date. After the KCS\nboard meeting, Mr. Ottensmeyer reached out to Party A and to Mr. Creel with the messages determined by the KCS board.\nOn December 4, 2020, KCS entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party A, which contained customary standstill restrictions on Party A (which\nrestrictions would terminate in the event any person acquired or became the owner of, or entered into a definitive agreement to acquire or become the\nowner of, more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of KCS or assets of KCS representing more than 50% of its consolidated earning power).\nOn December 8, 2020, KCS entered into formal engagement letters with Morgan Stanley and with BofA Securities to provide advice to KCS and the KCS\nboard with respect to KCS\u2019s strategic alternatives.\nOn December 9, 2020, CPRL submitted a written proposal to acquire KCS for 0.469 of a CPRL common share (equivalent to 2.345 shares after giving effect\nto the share split) and $77.00 in cash per share of KCS common stock (equal to approximately $235.00 per share of KCS common stock based on the\nmarket price of CPRL\n52\nTable of Contents\ncommon shares at the time). The proposal also contemplated that a transaction would be effectuated using a voting trust structure, which CPRL\nanticipated consummating within four months of signing a definitive agreement, with CPRL taking control of KCS following STB final approval within\neight to twelve months thereafter. Mr. Ottensmeyer and other members of management subsequently participated in a call with Mr. Creel and other\nmembers of CPRL management to discuss the terms of CPRL\u2019s proposal. On December 9, 2020, KCS entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement with\nCPRL, which contained customary standstill restrictions on CPRL (which restrictions would terminate in the event any person acquired or became the\nowner of, or entered into a definitive agreement to acquire or become the owner of, more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of KCS or assets\nof KCS representing more than 50% of its consolidated earning power).\nOn December 10, 2020, senior executives of each of CPRL and KCS (including Mr. Creel and Mr. Ottensmeyer) met, and CPRL presented the terms of its\nDecember 9 proposal.\nThe KCS board held a meeting on December 14, 2020 at which it discussed CPRL\u2019s proposal and the substance of the management team\u2019s conversation\nwith CPRL. The KCS board then determined that CPRL\u2019s proposal was not at a value that the KCS board was prepared to accept, but authorized\nmanagement to begin providing CPRL with due diligence materials under the mutual confidentiality agreement, so that CPRL could have an opportunity to\nsubmit an improved proposal.\nThrough December 2020, KCS provided Party A and CPRL with access to a virtual data room and various business and legal due diligence materials,\nincluding a copy of the KCS long-range plan and hosted management presentations and diligence sessions for the benefit of Party A and CPRL. CPRL\nalso provided KCS with access to a virtual data room and various reverse diligence materials.\nOn December 22, 2020, the KCS board held a special meeting, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA\nSecurities and KCS\u2019s legal advisors. Mr. Upchurch presented an update to the KCS long-range plan, which had been adjusted upwards to reflect\nmanagement\u2019s more optimistic financial and operational outlook for KCS as a result of the expected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a lower\ncost structure resulting from an acceleration of Precision Scheduled Railroading initiatives. Members of management then provided an update regarding\nthe status of Party A\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s ongoing diligence efforts, as well as internal discussions regarding the regulatory process and potential issues\nassociated with a strategic transaction. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities also shared their perspectives on the financial terms of\nParty A\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s latest proposals and refreshed their perspectives on valuation for KCS to reflect the new financial terms of those proposals and the\nupdated KCS long-range plan.\nOn December 28, 2020, Party A sent an updated written proposal to Messrs. Ottensmeyer and Upchurch to acquire KCS for $235.00 per share in cash. The\nproposal noted that, pursuant to the restrictions in its confidentiality agreement with KCS, Party A had not informed its equity partners or lenders of its\nrecent conversations with KCS, but that Party A remained highly confident of the availability of financing for a transaction.\nOn December 30, 2020, Mr. Ottensmeyer reached out to Mr. Creel to alert him that KCS would need CPRL to promptly provide a revised offer if CPRL was\nstill interested in pursuing a potential transaction, so that KCS could determine whether it would be willing to move towards a deal with CPRL or with a\ncompeting bidder.\nOn December 31, 2020, CPRL submitted an updated written proposal to acquire KCS for 0.489 of a CPRL common share (equivalent to 2.445 CPRL common\nshares after giving effect to the share split) and $78.00 in cash per share of KCS common stock (equal to approximately $248.00 per share of KCS common\nstock based on the market price of CPRL common shares at the time).\nThe KCS board met on January 7, 2021, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and KCS\u2019s\nlegal advisors. Mr. Ottensmeyer provided an update on the status of KCS\u2019s discussions with Party A and with CPRL and outlined potential next steps.\nMr. Ottensmeyer offered his\n53\nTable of Contents\nperspective that a potential combination with CPRL would be attractive for KCS and its stockholders and his expectation that CPRL could further increase\nits purchase price given potential synergies. Members of the KCS board and management also entered into a discussion regarding the updated KCS\nlong-range plan and a range of potential synergies for a combination with CPRL. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities provided their\nperspectives on the latest proposals received from Party A and from CPRL. The Company\u2019s Chief Legal Officer then described the expected regulatory\napproval process and potential timeline in the event KCS pursued a transaction with a Class 1 railroad company. After discussion, the KCS board\ndetermined not to accept either of the proposals that had been most recently submitted by Party A and by CPRL. The KCS board directed Mr.\nOttensmeyer to communicate to representatives of each party that the KCS board was not prepared to proceed with a transaction at its proposed\npurchase price, but that the KCS board was willing to allow each party to complete its confirmatory due diligence (and, in the case of Party A, to reengage\nwith its financing partners) with the expectation that the parties would complete diligence efforts by early-to-mid February and revert with their best and\nfinal offers. In addition, the KCS board again discussed the possibility of reaching out to other parties to ascertain their potential interest in a transaction,\nbut, for the same reasons considered at its previous meeting on December 2, 2020, determined not to do so at the time and to revisit the question again in\nthe future.\nIn the days following the meeting, Mr. Ottensmeyer communicated the KCS board\u2019s decisions to representatives of Party A and CPRL. Through the\ncourse of January and February 2021, members of KCS management, together with representatives of KCS\u2019s legal and financial advisors, continued to\nengage with and to address due diligence requests from Party A and from CPRL. Members of the KCS board also periodically met and consulted with\nmembers of management regarding the status of the process and to discuss transaction-related issues. On January 22 and 23, 2021, representatives of\nKCS, including Messrs. Druten and Ottensmeyer, met with representatives of CPRL to discuss CPRL\u2019s views on regulatory considerations and other\nissues relating to a potential combination with CPRL.\nFollowing a meeting of the CPRL board on January 25, 2021, Mr. Creel contacted Mr. Ottensmeyer to discuss the potential transaction and the timeline to\nannouncing a transaction. Mr. Ottensmeyer informed Mr. Creel that KCS expected to receive a revised offer from a competing bidder by mid-February and\nnoted that the competing bidder\u2019s offer would not have the regulatory complexity and need for a voting trust structure that would exist in a transaction\nwith CPRL. Mr. Ottensmeyer explained that KCS remained committed to evaluating offers from both CPRL and the competing bidder and continuing to\nhold working sessions with CPRL and its representatives to determine whether there was a path to a potential transaction with CPRL. Mr. Creel conveyed\nto Mr. Ottensmeyer that CPRL would be committed to engaging with KCS to complete its diligence and finalize the transaction structure and the terms of\nthe merger agreement over the coming weeks, and that CPRL would be prepared to provide its final offer on value and price by mid-February, such that\nCPRL and KCS would be in a position to announce a transaction by the end of February 2021 should KCS choose to move forward with CPRL.\nOn January 26, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting with members of management and its legal advisors to specifically discuss potential regulatory\nconsiderations and issues relating to a strategic combination, including an assessment of the process for a voting trust transaction and obtaining final\nregulatory approval for the potential merger. The KCS board also convened meetings on February 4, 2021 and February 15, 2021, at which the KCS board\nreviewed the status of KCS\u2019s discussions with Party A and CPRL and discussed potential next steps.\nOn February 16, 2021, Mr. Creel called Mr. Ottensmeyer to inform him that CPRL would not be submitting a revised proposal until KCS confirmed that it\nhad also received a revised competing proposal from the competing bidder. Mr. Ottensmeyer subsequently had separate discussions with both Mr. Creel\nand representatives of Party A regarding the status and timing with respect to the submission of revised bids.\nOn March 3, 2021, KCS received updated acquisition proposals from Party A and from CPRL. Party A\u2019s proposal contemplated an all-cash purchase price\nof $245.00 per share. The proposal indicated that Party A had re-engaged with its equity partners and that it was highly confident that the equity partners\nwould be able to\n54\nTable of Contents\nsecure final internal approvals upon confirmation of the key transaction terms over a two- to three-week period. The proposal also noted that Party A\nbelieved the credit committee approvals that its lenders had received in August 2020 remained valid, although it had not engaged in any recent\ndiscussions with its lenders in light of the restrictions in its confidentiality agreement with KCS. CPRL\u2019s proposal contemplated a purchase price of 0.489\nof a CPRL common share (equivalent to 2.445 CPRL common shares after giving effect to the share split) and $81.00 in cash per share of KCS common\nstock (equal to approximately $260.00 per share of KCS common stock based on the market price of CPRL common shares at the time). The proposal\nindicated that CPRL anticipated consummating the voting trust transaction within four to six months after the signing of the merger agreement, with the\nacquisition of control within eight to twelve months thereafter. CPRL\u2019s proposal also contemplated a $400.0 million reverse termination fee payable to KCS\nin the event the merger agreement was terminated due to the inability to complete the voting trust transaction as a result of STB regulatory issues.\nFurthermore, CPRL\u2019s proposal contemplated the renaming of the combined company to \u201cCanadian Pacific Kansas City\u201d, with the U.S. headquarters of the\ncombined company to be located in Kansas City, and indicated that CPRL would be open to considering KCS director representation on its board\nfollowing consummation of the voting trust transaction.\nIn the subsequent days, with the authorization of the KCS board, members of KCS management circulated a draft merger agreement to representatives of\nCPRL. The draft included, among other terms, a customary \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provision that would permit the KCS board to terminate its existing agreement\nwith an acquirer in order to accept an alternative acquisition proposal from a third party under certain circumstances. In addition, the draft merger\nagreement provided to CPRL contemplated a reverse termination fee representing 7.0% of the transaction consideration (or approximately $1.7 billion\nbased on CPRL\u2019s then proposed purchase price) and a one-way exchange ratio collar in which KCS stockholders would receive a fixed dollar amount of\nstock consideration in the event the acquirer\u2019s stock price fell below a specified threshold, up to a maximum number of shares.\nOn March 5, 2021, Mr. Ottensmeyer had a discussion with Mr. Creel regarding the key issues in the draft merger agreement received from KCS the prior\nday, including with respect to the transaction structure and regulatory termination fee size and structure as proposed in KCS\u2019s draft, as well as the one-\nway exchange ratio collar.\nOn March 6, 2021, the KCS board convened a meeting to discuss the updated proposals submitted by CPRL and Party A. Mr. Ottensmeyer reviewed the\nterms of each proposal and again expressed his views on the strategic options available to the Company. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA\nSecurities also shared their perspectives on the financial terms of the proposals. The directors discussed with members of management and\nrepresentatives of the financial advisors the potential synergies from a transaction involving CPRL and the possible benefits and risks associated with\naccepting merger consideration that included an acquirer\u2019s common stock. Among other things, the KCS board discussed various mechanisms to protect\nagainst a potential decline in an acquirer\u2019s stock price, including the one-way exchange ratio collar proposed in the draft merger agreement provided to\nCPRL. The KCS board discussed again with the Company\u2019s legal advisors the regulatory uncertainties and timeline for a strategic combination. The KCS\nboard then directed management and the financial advisors to ask Party A and CPRL to submit final proposals and merger agreement markups by no later\nthan March 15, and to inform Party A that it could reach out to its lending sources to confirm financing. The KCS board also again considered whether or\nnot to reach out to other parties. After considering, among other factors, the various risks associated with further opening up the process, and the\n\u201cfiduciary out\u201d provisions included in the proposed merger agreement, the KCS board determined to focus its efforts on negotiating a transaction with\neither Party A or CPRL and not to reach out to other potential counterparties at the time.\nFollowing the KCS board meeting, representatives of KCS and their advisors sent a letter to representatives of each of Party A and CPRL outlining the\nprocess and request for final proposals. In addition, representatives of KCS sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of Party A. Similar to the\ndraft merger agreement provided to CPRL, the draft merger agreement contemplated a customary \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provision that would permit the\n55\nTable of Contents\nKCS board to terminate its existing agreement with an acquirer in order to accept an alternative acquisition proposal under certain circumstances. It also\nincluded a reverse termination fee representing 7.0% of the transaction consideration (or approximately $1.6 billion based on Party A\u2019s then proposed\npurchase price) in the event the transaction did not close due to the failure to obtain financing.\nOn March 9, 2021, the finance committee of the KCS board held a meeting for the purpose of further analyzing and discussing the possible benefits and\nrisks associated with accepting merger consideration that included an acquirer\u2019s common stock. At the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nBofA Securities reviewed the mechanics of the one-way exchange ratio collar proposed in the draft merger agreement provided to CPRL and a range of\nother mechanisms that could be used to protect against a potential decline in an acquirer\u2019s stock price, together with a summary of the frequency with\nwhich such mechanisms had been employed or not employed in recent M&A transactions.\nOn March 10, 2021, KCS and CPRL executed a clean team agreement to facilitate the sharing of certain sensitive diligence materials. Also on March 10,\n2021, representatives of the CPRL management team held a reverse due diligence call with representatives of KCS.\nOn March 11, 2021, Wachtell Lipton sent to Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, CPRL\u2019s outside counsel (\u201cSullivan & Cromwell\u201d), an initial draft of the KCS\ndisclosure schedules to the merger agreement.\nOn March 15, 2021, Party A and CPRL submitted revised acquisition proposals, including markups of the forms of merger agreement previously provided\nby KCS. Party A\u2019s proposal contemplated an all-cash purchase price of $250.00 per share, which it noted was its \u201cfinal proposal.\u201d The proposal indicated\nthat Party A\u2019s lenders had received full credit committee approvals to increase the overall debt financing to $10.3 billion and that all but one of Party A\u2019s\nequity partners had received the required internal approvals to fund the transaction (Party A informed KCS subsequently that this final approval had\nbeen obtained). CPRL\u2019s proposal contemplated merger consideration of 0.489 of a CPRL common share (equivalent to 2.445 CPRL common shares after\ngiving effect to the share split), without any provision for a collar, and $86.00 in cash per share of KCS common stock (equal to approximately $268.00 per\nshare of KCS common stock based on the market price of CPRL common shares at the time). CPRL\u2019s proposal also contemplated, among other things, an\nincreased $800.0 million reverse termination fee and the elimination of the right of the KCS board to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a\nsuperior proposal in certain circumstances.\nOn March 16, 2021, the KCS board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and KCS\u2019s\nlegal advisors, to review the proposals received from Party A and CPRL. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities reviewed the history of\nKCS\u2019s discussions with Party A and with CPRL, including the financial terms of the proposals that each party had submitted since August 2020.\nRepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton also provided an overview of the merger agreement markups delivered by Party A and CPRL. The KCS board entered\ninto a discussion with members of management and representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors regarding Party A\u2019s proposed financing structure\nand its potential capacity to further increase its purchase price. It was the view of the KCS board based on this discussion, as well as Party A\u2019s statement\nthat it had made its \u201cfinal proposal\u201d, that Party A would have minimal room to further increase its offer. The KCS board considered these facts and\nperspectives, as well as the facts and perspectives previously discussed and reviewed at prior meetings, and determined to focus its efforts on\nnegotiating a transaction with CPRL, subject to CPRL agreeing to specific improvements to the terms of its proposal. To that end, the KCS board directed\nMr. Ottensmeyer to communicate to Mr. Creel that the KCS board would be willing to proceed with a transaction if CPRL were to improve its proposal by,\namong other things, increasing its contemplated exchange ratio from 0.489 to 0.5 of a CPRL common share, increasing the amount of the reverse\ntermination fee from $800.0 million to $1.3 billion, and accepting the KCS board\u2019s right to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior\nproposal in certain circumstances. A member of management and representatives of KCS\u2019s outside compensation advisor also reviewed the terms of a\nproposed retention\n56\nTable of Contents\nprogram and severance arrangements proposed to be submitted for approval by the KCS board were it to approve a transaction with CPRL. The KCS\nboard discussed the terms of and reasons for the proposed retention program and severance arrangements.\nLater that day, Mr. Ottensmeyer called Mr. Creel to communicate the KCS board\u2019s requests. Mr. Creel said that he would need to consult with members of\nLater that day, Mr. Ottensmeyer called Mr. Creel to communicate the KCS board\u2019s requests. Mr. Creel said that he would need to consult with members of\nthe CPRL board. Mr. Creel subsequently responded by stating that CPRL was prepared to offer an increased merger consideration of $90 in cash and 0.489\nof a CPRL common share (equivalent to 2.445 shares after giving effect to the share split) for each share of KCS common stock (equal to approximately\n$272 per share of KCS common stock based on the market price of CPRL common shares at the time), to increase the reverse termination fee to $1 billion,\nand to agree to the right of the KCS board to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal from a third party in certain circumstances.\nThe following day, CPRL submitted a revised written proposal reflecting these terms. Mr. Ottensmeyer informed the KCS board of the terms of CPRL\u2019s\nproposal, and at the direction of the KCS board and management, representatives of Wachtell Lipton proceeded to negotiate final terms of the transaction\ndocuments with representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, with the goal of announcing a signed merger agreement no later than the morning of March 21,\n2021. From March 17 through March 20, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Sullivan & Cromwell exchanged further revised drafts of the merger\nagreement and participated in calls to resolve the remaining open issues.\nOn March 20, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities\nand KCS\u2019s legal advisors. A representative of Wachtell Lipton again discussed with the board its fiduciary duties under Delaware law. Thereafter,\nrepresentatives of each of the financial advisors presented to the KCS board their respective financial analyses and each financial advisor rendered to the\nKCS board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject\nto the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, as set\nforth in each financial advisor\u2019s respective written opinion, the consideration to be received in the transaction by holders of KCS common stock (other\nthan certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Wachtell Lipton\nrepresentative then summarized the terms of the merger agreement compared to the terms previously reviewed. After further discussion and deliberation,\nthe KCS board unanimously approved the merger agreement and resolved to recommend that the stockholders of KCS adopt the merger agreement. The\nKCS board also approved the proposed retention and severance arrangements previously discussed.\nFollowing the completion of the KCS board meeting, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Sullivan & Cromwell finalized the merger agreement, and in\nthe early morning of March 21, 2021, KCS and CPRL executed the prior CP merger agreement. KCS and CPRL issued a joint press release announcing the\ntransaction in the morning of March 21, 2021.\nOn March 22, 2021, representatives of CPRL submitted a letter to STB Staff requesting an informal opinion that CPRL\u2019s proposed voting trust agreement\ncomported with the standards set forth in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1013.3(a).\nOn April 20, 2021, KCS received an unsolicited written proposal from CN (the \u201cCN proposal\u201d) to acquire KCS for 1.059 common shares of CN and $200.00\nin cash per share of KCS common stock (valued at $325.00 per share of KCS common stock based on the market price of CN common shares at the time).\nThe proposal contemplated that CN and KCS would enter into a merger agreement with substantially similar terms to those of the prior CP merger\nagreement, including the use of a voting trust arrangement and a commitment to obtain regulatory approvals on the same terms as in the prior CP merger\nagreement.\nThe KCS board met on April 20, 2021, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and KCS\u2019s\nlegal advisors, for a preliminary review of the CN proposal. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities reviewed and discussed their\npreliminary perspectives\n57\nTable of Contents\non the financial terms of the CN proposal in comparison to the financial terms of the prior CP merger agreement. The KCS board also reviewed potential\nsynergy estimates for a combination with CN relative to the synergies estimated for the transaction with CPRL.\nOn April 23, 2021, the STB announced a decision that the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.0(b) applied to the proposed transaction between CPRL\nand KCS and stated that the agency\u2019s review of the transaction would be governed by the regulations set forth at 49 C.F.R. part 1180 (2000).\nOn April 24, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities\nand KCS\u2019s legal advisors. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities again shared their perspectives on the financial terms of the CN\nproposal in comparison to the financial terms of the prior CP merger agreement. The KCS board reviewed the potential synergies for a combination with\neach of CPRL and CN and discussed with the advisors the likely capacity of each party to further increase its purchase price and other enhancements that\ncould be requested of CPRL and CN with respect to the terms of a transaction. The KCS board also discussed the regulatory considerations and issues\nrelating to a combination with CN relative to CPRL, including an assessment of the process for approval of the proposed voting trust and for obtaining\nfinal regulatory approval for the potential combination. After consideration of these facts and perspectives, as well as the facts and perspectives\npreviously discussed and reviewed at the KCS board\u2019s April 20th meeting, the KCS board determined that the CN proposal could reasonably be expected\nto lead to a \u201cCompany Superior Proposal\u201d, as defined in the prior CP merger agreement (which we refer to as a \u201ccompany superior proposal\u201d).\nAccordingly, the KCS board determined that KCS should provide information to CN, and engage in discussions and negotiations with CN, with respect\nto the CN proposal. KCS management subsequently notified representatives of CN and CPRL of the KCS board\u2019s determination, after which KCS issued a\npress release announcing its decision and intent to engage in discussions with CN. On the evening of April 24, 2021, representatives of Cravath, Swaine\n& Moore LLP (which we refer to as \u201cCravath\u201d), CN\u2019s outside counsel, sent to Wachtell Lipton proposed forms of a merger agreement and a voting trust\nagreement reflecting the terms described in the CN proposal.\nOn April 26, 2021, representatives of CN submitted an application to the STB requesting approval of CN\u2019s proposed voting trust agreement, pursuant to\n49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.4(b)(4)(iv) (and not under the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.0(b)). Also on April 26, 2021, KCS entered into a confidentiality\nagreement and clean team agreement with CN in substantially the same forms as the confidentiality agreements entered into with CPRL and Party A, other\nthan the absence of standstill provisions and other immaterial changes. Through the subsequent weeks, KCS provided CN with access to a virtual data\nroom and various business and legal due diligence materials, including a copy of the KCS long-range plan. Representatives of CN participated in\nmanagement presentations and diligence sessions hosted by KCS. In addition, CN provided KCS with access to a virtual data room and various reverse\ndiligence materials.\nOn May 6, 2021, the STB announced a decision finding that the voting trust agreement proposed by CPRL was acceptable, subject to certain\nmodifications.\nOn May 8, 2021, the KCS board convened a meeting with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and\nKCS\u2019s legal advisors to discuss KCS\u2019s ongoing engagement with CN and potential next steps. Members of management and representatives of Wachtell\nLipton reviewed the terms of CN\u2019s draft merger agreement and presented a proposed list of enhancements to request from CN with respect to the CN\nproposal, including (1) increasing the exchange ratio from 1.059 shares so that the transaction could qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of\nSection 368(a) of the Code, (2) increasing the reverse termination fee payable to KCS in the event the merger agreement was terminated due to the\ninability of the parties to complete the voting trust transaction as a result of STB regulatory issues from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion, (3) requiring CN to\nreimburse KCS upon payment of the $700.0 million termination fee by KCS to CPRL in the event KCS terminated the prior CP merger agreement to enter\ninto a merger agreement with CN and (4) enhancing the flexibility of KCS to undertake certain actions following the execution of a merger agreement with\nCN without CN\u2019s prior written consent, including with respect to the terms of KCS\u2019s retention program and\n58\nTable of Contents\nseverance arrangements. The KCS board also reviewed a proposed timeline for soliciting a revised proposal from CN. The KCS board then directed\nmanagement, together with KCS\u2019s legal advisors, to seek the enhancements to the CN proposal discussed with the KCS board and to request that CN\nsubmit a revised binding proposal so that the KCS board could be in a position to make a determination as to whether such revised proposal constituted\na company superior proposal at a meeting scheduled for May 13, 2021. The KCS board also directed management to notify CPRL of the KCS board\u2019s\nintention to make a determination with respect to the CN proposal at its next meeting and to suggest that CPRL submit any revisions with respect to the\nprior CP merger agreement before such time.\nFollowing the meeting, Mr. Ottensmeyer communicated the KCS board\u2019s requests to Mr. Ruest and to Mr. Creel. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton also\nreached out to Cravath to review the requested enhancements with respect to the CN proposal.\nOn May 11, 2021, representatives of Cravath contacted Wachtell Lipton to convey CN\u2019s responses to KCS\u2019s requested enhancements. The\nrepresentatives of Cravath expressed that CN was prepared to accept several of KCS\u2019s requests for enhanced flexibility during the pendency of the\ntransaction, including with respect to the terms of KCS\u2019s retention program and severance arrangements. The representatives of Cravath also expressed\nthat CN was prepared to accept KCS\u2019s proposal that CN (or an affiliate of CN) reimburse KCS for the $700.0 million termination fee that would be payable\nby KCS to CPRL in connection with the termination of the prior CP merger agreement, subject to KCS refunding such reimbursement in the event (i) KCS\nterminated the merger agreement with CN in order to accept a superior proposal, (ii) CN terminated the merger agreement upon a change of\nrecommendation by the KCS board, (iii) CN terminated the merger agreement on the basis of a breach by KCS of its representations, warranties or\ncovenants in a manner that would entitle CN not to consummate the merger or (iv) CN terminated the merger agreement on the basis of the occurrence of\na material adverse effect on the business and operations of KCS. The Cravath representatives indicated that CN was unwilling to increase the exchange\nratio or the reverse termination fee.\nOn May 12, 2021, Mr. Ottensmeyer called Mr. Ruest to request that CN increase its exchange ratio so as to restore the $325.00 per share valuation of the\nCN proposal based on the current market price of CN common shares. Mr. Ottensmeyer further requested that CN consider increasing the amount of the\nreverse termination fee payable to KCS in the event the merger agreement was terminated due to the inability of the parties to complete the voting trust\ntransaction as a result of STB regulatory issues. Mr. Ottensmeyer also spoke with Mr. Creel and encouraged CPRL to submit any proposed revisions to\nthe prior CP merger agreement before the KCS board\u2019s next meeting.\nOn the morning of May 13, 2021, representatives of Cravath sent to representatives of Wachtell Lipton a proposed form of offer letter and revised drafts\nof the merger agreement and other transaction documents. CN\u2019s revised proposal contemplated an increase in the exchange ratio to 1.129 shares of CN\ncommon shares while maintaining the $200.00 per share cash component of the proposed consideration (restoring the $325.00 per share valuation of the\nCN proposal based on the closing price of CN common shares on May 12, 2021), an obligation by an affiliate of CN to reimburse KCS for the $700.0\nmillion termination fee payable to CPRL (subject to KCS refunding such reimbursement in the event (i) KCS terminated the merger agreement with CN in\norder to accept a superior proposal, (ii) CN terminated the merger agreement upon a change of recommendation by the KCS board or (iii) CN terminated\nthe merger agreement on the basis of a breach by KCS of its representations, warranties or covenants in a manner that would entitle CN not to\nconsummate the merger), and enhanced flexibility on the part of KCS to undertake certain actions without CN\u2019s prior written consent during the pendency\nof the transaction, including with respect to the terms of KCS\u2019s retention program and severance arrangements. Through the morning and early\nafternoon, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Cravath discussed various minor revisions to the transaction documents. Representatives of Cravath\nthen submitted a binding offer letter on behalf of CN, together with proposed final and binding forms of merger agreement and schedules (collectively, the\n\u201crevised CN proposal\u201d). The offer letter indicated that the revised CN proposal could be accepted by KCS at any time prior to 5:00 pm Eastern Time on\nMay 21, 2021.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOn the afternoon of May 13, 2021, the KCS board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA\nSecurities and KCS\u2019s legal advisors, to discuss the revised CN proposal. The KCS board reviewed the terms of the revised CN proposal relative to the\nterms of the prior CP merger agreement and discussed various regulatory considerations relating to a combination with CN and with CPRL, including the\nSTB\u2019s decision to apply the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.0(b) to the potential CPRL transaction and CPRL\u2019s receipt of STB voting trust\napproval. The KCS board discussed potential next steps and the requirements of the prior CP merger agreement with respect to any further engagement\nwith CN. Among other things, the KCS board considered the fact that, in the event the KCS board determined that the revised CN proposal constituted a\ncompany superior proposal, KCS would be required to provide CPRL the opportunity for at least five business days to attempt to match the terms of the\nrevised CN proposal prior to terminating the prior CP merger agreement and entering into a definitive agreement with CN. Representatives of Morgan\nStanley and BofA Securities also provided to the KCS board their respective financial analyses. The representatives stated that they had each reviewed\nthe terms of the revised CN proposal with their respective fairness committees and that, absent any material developments following the conclusion of\nthe meeting, the financial advisors stood ready to deliver customary fairness opinions with respect to the revised CN proposal at such time as the KCS\nboard were to consider terminating the prior CP merger agreement and entering into a merger agreement in relation to the revised CN proposal. The KCS\nboard determined that the revised CN proposal constituted a company superior proposal and directed management to notify CPRL of the KCS board\u2019s\nintention to terminate the prior CP merger agreement and to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the revised CN proposal unless, at the end of\nthe five business day period following the notice, the KCS board determined that the revised CN proposal no longer constituted a company superior\nproposal. Members of KCS management communicated the KCS board\u2019s determination to representatives of CN and CPRL after the end of the meeting,\nand later on the evening of May 13, 2021, KCS issued a press release announcing the KCS board\u2019s determination.\nOn May 17, 2021, the STB announced a decision finding that application of the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.0(b) to a potential transaction\nbetween CN and KCS was not warranted and stated that the agency\u2019s review of the transaction would be governed by the regulations set forth at 49\nC.F.R. part 1180, as adopted in Major Rail Consolidation Procedures, 5 S.T.B. 539 (2001). The STB also denied CN\u2019s motion to approve its proposed voting\ntrust agreement as incomplete, without prejudice to filing a new motion.\nOn the morning of May 20, 2021, Mr. Creel contacted Mr. Ottensmeyer to notify him that CPRL did not intend to propose revisions to the prior CP merger\nagreement, explaining that, in CPRL\u2019s view, it would be destructive to CPRL\u2019s and KCS\u2019s mutual interests to engage in a bidding war with CN. Shortly\nthereafter, Mr. Creel publicly announced CPRL\u2019s intention not to increase its offer. Later that afternoon, the KCS board convened a meeting to discuss\nnext steps with respect to the revised CN proposal. The KCS board reviewed again with KCS\u2019s financial and legal advisors the financial terms of the\nrevised CN proposal in comparison to the financial terms of the prior CP merger agreement. The KCS board also discussed the regulatory considerations\nassociated with pursuing a transaction with CN and CPRL, including the STB\u2019s determinations with respect to CN\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s proposed voting trust\nagreements, and considered the possibility of seeking additional enhancements to CN\u2019s proposal. The KCS board then directed management to reach out\nto CN to request a further increase in the exchange ratio so as to restore the $325.00 per share valuation of the CN proposal based on the current market\nprice of CN common shares and a revised \u201cescalating\u201d reverse termination fee that would increase by $100.0 million per month in the event CN were\nunable to obtain STB voting trust approval within three months of the execution of a merger agreement with KCS.\nFollowing the meeting, Mr. Ottensmeyer contacted Mr. Ruest to convey the requests from the KCS board. Later that evening, Mr. Ruest reached out to\nMr. Ottensmeyer to indicate that CN was not willing to make any further changes to the revised CN proposal.\nOn the morning of May 21, 2021, the KCS board met again. Mr. Ottensmeyer updated the KCS board as to his conversations with Mr. Ruest, after which a\ndiscussion followed among the directors as to potential next steps. A representative of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the board its fiduciary duties\nunder Delaware law. Thereafter,\n60\nTable of Contents\nrepresentatives of each of the financial advisors presented to the KCS board their respective financial analyses and each financial advisor rendered to the\nKCS board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject\nto the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, as set\nforth in each financial advisor\u2019s respective written opinion, the consideration to be received in the transaction with CN by holders of KCS common stock\n(other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. After further discussion\nand deliberation, the KCS board unanimously determined that the revised CN proposal continued to constitute a company superior proposal and\napproved the termination of the prior CP merger agreement, KCS\u2019s payment of the $700.0 million CP termination payment to CPRL pursuant to the terms of\nthe prior CP merger agreement and KCS\u2019s entry into the merger agreement with CN. The KCS board also approved the updated retention and severance\narrangements set forth in the revised CN proposal.\nFollowing the completion of the KCS board meeting, KCS management notified CPRL of the KCS board\u2019s determination, after which KCS terminated the\nprior CP merger agreement and paid the $700.0 million CP termination payment to CPRL. Shortly thereafter, KCS delivered an executed signature page to\nthe CN agreement, which had already been executed by CN, and KCS and CN issued a joint press release announcing the transaction. Following\nexecution of the CN agreement, an affiliate of CN reimbursed KCS for the $700.0 million CP termination payment paid to CPRL.\nOn May 26, 2021, representatives of KCS and CN jointly filed with the STB a renewed motion for approval of CN\u2019s proposed voting trust agreement. The\nmotion included, among other things, a commitment by CN to divest KCS\u2019s 70-mile line between New Orleans and Baton Rouge following the\nconsummation of a transaction and STB final approval.\nOn June 8, 2021, the STB issued a timetable for reviewing CN\u2019s proposed voting trust agreement. The STB directed KCS and CN to file certain additional\nmaterials relating to the financial condition of CN with the STB by June 14, 2021 and requested public comments on CN\u2019s proposed voting trust on June\n28, 2021 and KCS\u2019s and CN\u2019s replies on July 6, 2021.\nOn June 22, 2021, CN filed with the SEC a preliminary Form F-4 registration statement with respect to the CN common shares issuable in the proposed\nmerger with KCS. The registration statement included a preliminary proxy statement of KCS relating to the KCS stockholder meeting proposed to be\nconvened to vote on the CN merger (the \u201cKCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting\u201d).\nOn July 2, 2021, KCS fixed and announced August 19, 2021 as the date for the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting.\nOn July 7, 2021, CN filed with the SEC a final prospectus with respect to the CN common shares issuable in the proposed merger with KCS and KCS filed\na definitive proxy statement with respect to KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting.\nOn July 29, 2021, CPRL filed with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of votes against the CN merger at the KCS-CN\nmerger approval stockholder meeting. On August 9, 2021, CPRL filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of votes\nagainst the CN merger at the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting.\nOn the morning of August 10, 2021, KCS received an unsolicited written proposal from CPRL (the \u201crevised CPRL proposal\u201d) to acquire KCS for 2.884\nCPRL common shares and $90.00 in cash per share of KCS common stock (valued at $300.00 per share of KCS common stock based on the market price of\nCPRL common shares at the time). The revised CPRL proposal contemplated that CPRL and KCS would enter into a merger agreement with substantially\nsimilar terms to those of the CN agreement and included proposed forms of a merger agreement and a voting trust agreement. The revised CPRL proposal\nindicated that, in connection with KCS\u2019s termination of the CN agreement, CPRL would remit $1.4 billion to KCS to reimburse KCS for the payment of\n61\nTable of Contents\nthe $700.0 million termination payment that would be due to CN and the $700.0 million refund that would be due to an affiliate of CN with respect to the\nCN affiliate\u2019s reimbursement of the CP termination payment previously paid by KCS to CPRL. The revised CPRL proposal contemplated that KCS would\nbe required to refund the full amount of the reimbursement in connection with the termination of a merger agreement under specified circumstances. In the\nafternoon of August 10, 2021, the STB announced that it expected to issue a decision on CN\u2019s proposed voting trust no later than August 31, 2021. The\nKCS board convened a meeting on the same day, together with members of senior management and representatives of KCS\u2019s legal advisors for a\npreliminary review of the revised CPRL proposal and to discuss the STB\u2019s announcement and potential next steps. The KCS board instructed Mr.\nOttensmeyer to reach out to Mr. Ruest to inquire as to whether CN would be willing to increase its purchase price or otherwise improve the terms of its\nproposed merger in light of the receipt of the revised CPRL proposal and the STB\u2019s recent announcement.\nOn August 11, 2021, Mr. Ottensmeyer contacted Mr. Ruest to communicate the KCS board\u2019s inquiry. Later that day, Mr. Ruest indicated that CN was not\nprepared to increase its proposed purchase price or otherwise modify the terms of the proposed transaction, but that CN would support a decision by the\nKCS board (if the KCS board so decided) to adjourn the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting to take place after the STB\u2019s announcement of a\nfinal ruling on the CN voting trust.\nOn August 12, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities\nand KCS\u2019s legal advisors. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities shared their perspectives on the financial terms of the revised CPRL\nproposal in comparison to the financial terms of the CN agreement. The KCS board reviewed the potential synergies for a combination with each of CN\nand CPRL and discussed with management and the advisors the potential capacity of each party to further enhance the terms of a transaction, including\nthe feedback Mr. Ottensmeyer had received from Mr. Ruest regarding CN\u2019s unwillingness to improve the terms of its proposal. The KCS board also\ndiscussed the feedback received from investors and the potential paths available to KCS and reviewed again the regulatory considerations and issues\nrelating to a combination with CPRL relative to CN. The KCS board then determined that the revised CPRL proposal did not constitute, and could not\nreasonably be expected to lead to, a \u201cCompany Superior Proposal\u201d, as defined in the CN agreement (which, for purposes of the remainder of this section\nof this proxy statement/prospectus, we refer to as a \u201ccompany superior proposal\u201d). The KCS board also determined to adjourn the KCS-CN merger\napproval stockholder meeting in the event the STB did not release a public decision on the CN voting trust by August 17, 2021, at 6:00 p.m., Central Time.\nShortly thereafter, KCS issued a press release announcing its decision. Because the STB had not yet released its decision on the CN voting trust, on\nAugust 19, 2021, KCS convened and adjourned the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting until September 3, 2021.\nOn August 31, 2021, the STB announced a unanimous decision rejecting the use of a voting trust agreement in connection with the proposed transaction\nbetween KCS and CN. Later that day, Mr. Creel called Mr. Ottensmeyer to renew and reaffirm the terms of the revised CPRL proposal, which Mr. Creel\nconveyed in writing to Mr. Ottensmeyer shortly after the conclusion of their call, together with proposed forms of a merger agreement and a voting trust\nagreement. The letter indicated that the revised CPRL proposal would expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 12, 2021, if KCS did not deliver\nevidence to CPRL by that time that KCS had delivered to CN notice of its intention to terminate the CN agreement and enter into a merger agreement with\nCPRL. At 8:00 p.m., Eastern Time, the KCS board convened a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA\nSecurities and KCS\u2019s legal advisors, to discuss the developments of the day. After deliberation, in light of these developments, the KCS board determined\nto further adjourn the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting.\nOn September 3, 2021, KCS convened and adjourned the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting until September 24, 2021.\nOn the morning of September 4, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan\nStanley, BofA Securities and KCS\u2019s legal advisors, to discuss the\n62\nTable of Contents\nrevised CPRL proposal and potential next steps. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities again provided their perspectives on the\nfinancial terms of the revised CPRL proposal in comparison to the financial terms of the CN agreement. The KCS board reviewed an illustrative expected\nvalue comparison with respect to the CN and CPRL offers weighted, respectively, by a range of probabilities of consummating a voting trust transaction\nin connection with each offer. Mr. Ottensmeyer also informed the KCS board that Mr. Ruest had indicated that CN would be willing to join KCS in an\nappeal of the STB ruling denying approval of the CN voting trust, and would be willing to explore the possibility of pursuing a combination of KCS and\nCN without a voting trust, but that CN would not be willing to increase the merger consideration or the reverse termination fee that would be payable to\nKCS if regulatory approval were not obtained.\nThe KCS board then discussed a proposed list of potential enhancements to request from CN and CPRL. These included, with respect to CN, requests to\nappeal the STB decision and increase the proposed purchase price and reverse termination fee due to KCS (notwithstanding Mr. Ruest\u2019s statements to\nMr. Ottensmeyer), and with respect to CPRL, requests to increase the proposed purchase price, reduce the amount of the reimbursement that would be\nrefundable by KCS under certain circumstances from $1.4 billion to $700.0 million, permit KCS to pay a one-time special dividend to KCS stockholders\nprior to closing, revise the contemplated transaction structure so that the transaction could qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section\n368(a) of the Code (as was contemplated in the prior CP merger agreement) and enhance the flexibility of KCS to undertake certain actions following the\nexecution of a merger agreement with CPRL without CPRL\u2019s prior written consent (such as with respect to the terms of KCS\u2019s retention program and\nseverance arrangements). The KCS board also reviewed a proposed timeline for soliciting revised proposals from CN and CPRL. After consideration of\nthese perspectives, together with analysis of the STB\u2019s ruling on the CN voting trust and the other events of the week, the KCS board determined that\nthe revised CPRL proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a company superior proposal. Accordingly, the KCS board determined that KCS\nshould provide information to CPRL, and engage in discussions and negotiations with CPRL, with respect to the revised CPRL proposal. The KCS board\nthen directed management, together with KCS\u2019s legal advisors, to seek from CN and CPRL the enhancements discussed with the KCS board. KCS\nmanagement subsequently notified representatives of CN and CPRL of the KCS board\u2019s determination, after which KCS issued a press release\nannouncing its decision and intent to engage in discussions with CPRL.\nOver the following week, KCS provided CPRL with renewed access to a virtual data room and various business and legal due diligence materials,\nincluding a copy of the KCS long-range plan, and responded to diligence requests and questions from CPRL. In addition, CPRL provided KCS with\nrenewed access to a virtual data room and various reverse diligence materials, including a copy of CPRL\u2019s internal five-year financial forecast (the \u201cCPRL\nfive-year plan\u201d). Additionally, during this time, members of KCS management and representatives of KCS\u2019s legal advisors discussed with their\ncounterparts at CN and CPRL the proposed enhancements sought by the KCS board with respect to their respective proposals. On September 5, 2021,\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton sent to representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell a revised draft of the merger agreement reflecting these requested\nenhancements.\nOn September 6, 2021, Mr. Creel reached out to Mr. Ottensmeyer to express that CPRL was prepared to reduce the amount of the reimbursement that\nwould be refundable by KCS under certain circumstances from $1.4 billion to $700.0 million, revise the contemplated transaction structure so that the\ntransaction could qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and accept several of KCS\u2019s requests for enhanced\nflexibility during the pendency of the transaction, including with respect to the terms of KCS\u2019s retention program and severance arrangements. Mr. Creel\nindicated that CPRL was unwilling to accept KCS\u2019s other requests, including the request for any additional merger consideration and the ability to pay a\none-time special dividend to KCS stockholders. On the next day, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell sent to representatives of Wachtell Lipton\nrevised drafts of the transaction documents reflecting the positions communicated by Mr. Creel. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Sullivan &\nCromwell subsequently discussed various minor revisions to the transaction documents.\n63\nTable of Contents\nOn September 9, 2021, Mr. Ruest reiterated CN\u2019s position that CN would be willing to pursue an appeal of the STB ruling and to explore the possibility of\npursuing a combination of KCS and CN without a voting trust, but that CN would not be willing to increase its merger consideration or reverse\ntermination fee.\nOn the night of September 11, 2021, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell sent to representatives of Wachtell Lipton a binding offer letter, dated\nSeptember 12, 2021, and final forms of merger agreement and other transaction documents (collectively, the \u201cfinal CPRL proposal\u201d). The binding offer\nletter indicated that the final CPRL proposal could be accepted at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on September 20, 2021, assuming that the KCS\nboard determined that the final CPRL proposal constituted a company superior proposal and KCS delivered to CN, no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time\non September 12, 2021, notice of KCS\u2019s intention to terminate the CN agreement and enter into a merger agreement with CPRL.\nOn the morning of September 12, 2021, the KCS board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA\nSecurities and KCS\u2019s legal advisors, to discuss the final CPRL proposal. The KCS board reviewed the terms of the final CPRL proposal relative to the\nterms of the CN agreement and discussed potential next steps and the requirements of the CN agreement with respect to any further engagement with\nCPRL, including the obligation of KCS to provide CN the opportunity for at least five business days to attempt to match the terms of the final CPRL\nproposal in the event the KCS board determined that the final CPRL proposal constituted a company superior proposal. Representatives of Morgan\nStanley and BofA Securities also provided to the KCS board their respective financial analyses. The representatives stated that they had each reviewed\nthe terms of the final CPRL proposal with their respective fairness committees and that, absent any material developments following the conclusion of the\nmeeting, the financial advisors stood ready to deliver customary fairness opinions with respect to the final CPRL proposal at such time as the KCS board\nwere to consider terminating the CN agreement and accept the final CPRL proposal.\nFollowing these presentations and discussions, the KCS board determined that the final CPRL proposal constituted a company superior proposal and\ndirected management to notify CN of the KCS board\u2019s intention to terminate the CN agreement and to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the\nfinal CPRL proposal unless, at the end of the five business day period following the notice, the KCS board determined that the final CPRL proposal no\nlonger constituted a company superior proposal. After the end of the meeting, members of KCS management communicated the KCS board\u2019s\ndetermination to representatives of CN and CPRL and KCS issued a press release announcing the KCS board\u2019s determination.\nOn September 13, 2021, members of KCS and CN management and representatives of their respective legal advisors began discussing the possibility of\nentering into a waiver letter agreement pursuant to which CN would agree to waive the five business day match period under the CN agreement.\nRepresentatives of CN reiterated the position that CN was unwilling to offer any additional merger consideration or increase the amount of the reverse\ntermination fee contemplated by CN\u2019s proposed transaction with KCS. On September 14, 2021, representatives of CN communicated to KCS that CN was\nprepared to enter into the waiver letter agreement. Shortly thereafter, representatives of KCS notified CPRL of CN\u2019s intention to waive the five business\nday match period under the CN agreement and that, as such, the KCS board would convene a meeting the next morning to make a final determination as\nto whether or not to terminate the CN agreement and accept the final CPRL proposal.\nOn the morning of September 15, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting. A representative of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the board its fiduciary duties\nunder Delaware law. Thereafter, representatives of each of the financial advisors presented to the KCS board their respective financial analyses and each\nfinancial advisor rendered to the KCS board its oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of its written opinion dated September 15, 2021, to the\neffect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and\nlimitations on the scope of the review undertaken by such financial advisor, as set forth in such financial advisor\u2019s written opinion, the consideration to\nbe received by holders of KCS common stock (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) in the transaction with CPRL was\nfair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of each of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities is attached to this\nproxy statement as Annexes B and C, respectively, and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. See also the sections entitled\n64\nTable of Contents\n\u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Opinion of Morgan Stanley\u201d and \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Opinion of BofA Securities\u201d on pages 72 and 85,\nrespectively. After further discussion and deliberation, the KCS board unanimously determined that the final CPRL proposal continued to constitute a\ncompany superior proposal and approved the proposed waiver letter agreement with CN, termination of the CN merger agreement, KCS\u2019s payment of the\n$700.0 million CN agreement termination payment and the $700.0 million CN refund owed to CN (or its affiliates) under the terms of the CN agreement, and\nKCS\u2019s entry into the merger agreement with CPRL. The KCS board also approved the updated retention and severance arrangements set forth in the final\nCPRL proposal.\nFollowing the completion of the KCS board meeting, KCS management notified CN of the KCS board\u2019s determination, after which KCS and CN entered\ninto the waiver letter agreement and KCS terminated the CN agreement and paid the $700.0 million CN agreement termination payment. Shortly thereafter,\nKCS delivered an executed signature page to the merger agreement with CPRL, which had already been executed by CPRL, and KCS and CPRL issued a\njoint press release announcing the transaction. Following execution of the merger agreement, CPRL remitted to KCS $700.0 million in connection with the\npayment of the CN agreement termination payment made by KCS to CN, KCS paid the $700.0 million CN refund to an affiliate of CN, and CPRL remitted to\nKCS $700.0 million in connection with the payment of the CN refund made by KCS to an affiliate of CN.\nRecommendation of the KCS Board\u037e KCS\u2019s Reasons for the Transaction",

            "text": "Recommendation of the KCS Board\u037e KCS\u2019s Reasons for the Transaction\nAt a special meeting held on September 15, 2021, the KCS board unanimously: (1) determined that it was in the best interests of KCS and its stockholders,\nand declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement with CPRL\u037e (2) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement\nand the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the merger)\u037e (3) recommended that the stockholders of KCS adopt the merger\nagreement\u037e and (4) directed that the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of KCS\u2019s stockholders. The KCS board unanimously\nrecommends that KCS stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal.\nIn evaluating the transaction and in reaching its determinations and making its recommendations with respect to the merger agreement, the KCS board\nconsulted with KCS senior management and outside legal and financial advisors over the course of several meetings, and considered a number of factors,\nincluding the following material factors that weighed in favor of the transaction.\nStrategic Considerations and Synergies:\n\u2022\nThe KCS board believes the transaction will create the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico and Canada, with the ability to deliver\ndramatically expanded market reach for KCS and CPRL customers, provide new competitive transportation options, provide infrastructure,\npublic safety and environmental benefits through truck to rail conversion opportunities, and support North American economic growth\u037e\n\u2022\nThe KCS board believes CPRL and KCS are the fastest growing Class 1 railroads, with significant success in the transformation to Precision\nScheduled Railroading\u037e\n\u2022\nThe KCS board considered a synergy analysis (based on CPRL\u2019s synergies analysis) showing annualized EBITDA synergies for the\ncombined company of approximately $990 million (plus $20 million of capital expenditure and depreciation and amortization synergies)\nexpected to be realized within the first three years after the transaction, primarily by executing the combined growth strategies of KCS and\nCPRL with new efficiencies for customers and improved on-time performance under their respective PSR programs\u037e the KCS board also\nconsidered a more conservative synergy analysis\nprepared by KCS management showing EBITDA synergies of approximately $377 million (plus\n65Table of Contents\n$23 million of capital expenditure and depreciation and amortization synergies) over three years, and assessed both synergy analyses in\nmaking its decision, as further described in the section entitled \u201cKCS Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nThe KCS board believes that the combined company will have the scale, balance sheet strength, financial flexibility, and free cash flow to\nfund future growth, and improved ability to access the capital markets on more favorable terms than available to KCS as an independent\ncompany, which would allow the combined company to be more competitive in capturing strategic opportunities\u037e\n\u2022\nThe KCS board received information from and had discussions with KCS\u2019s management, in consultation with outside financial advisors,\nregarding CPRL\u2019s business, results of operations, financial and market position, KCS management\u2019s expectations concerning the combined\ncompany\u2019s business and financial prospects, and historical and current trading prices of CPRL common shares\u037e\nAttractive Value and Mix of Consideration\n\u2022\nThe KCS board considered the aggregate value and nature of the consideration to be received in the transaction by KCS stockholders,\nincluding:\n\u2022\nthat the merger consideration had an implied value per share of KCS common stock of $300, based on the closing price of CPRL\ncommon shares on the NYSE as of August 9, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the date on which CPRL submitted the revised\nCPRL proposal), which represented a premium of approximately 34% to KCS stockholders based on the unaffected closing price of\nKCS common stock on March 19, 2021 (the last trading day before the KCS board\u2019s approval of and the announcement of the prior CP\nmerger agreement)\u037e\n\u2022\nthat based on CPRL\u2019s market price on September 13, 2021, approximately 69% of the merger consideration consists of CPRL common\nshares, with the CPRL common shares to be issued to KCS common stockholders constituting approximately 28% of the outstanding\nshares of CPRL common shares following the transaction, offering KCS common stockholders the opportunity for meaningful\nownership participation in the future earnings, dividends, synergies and growth of the combined company, a company which the KCS\nboard considers to be an attractive investment for the reasons discussed above in the section entitled \u201cStrategic Considerations and\nSynergies\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthat based on CPRL\u2019s market price on September 13, 2021, approximately 31% of the merger consideration consists of cash, which\nprovides KCS stockholders with immediate liquidity for a portion of their shares\u037e and\n\u2022\nthat the first merger and the second merger, taken together, are intended to qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section\n368(a) of the Code and that Section 367(a)(1) of the Code will not apply to cause the mergers to result in gain recognition by holders\nof KCS common stock that exchange their shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration (other than any Excepted\nShareholder), as more fully described in the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\u201d\u037e\nAttractive Strategic Alternative:\n\u2022\nThe KCS board believes that the transaction with CPRL is attractive in comparison to the alternative of remaining independent and\ncontinuing to execute on KCS\u2019s long-range business strategy and is also attractive in comparison to other alternatives, including the CN\nagreement. In this regard, the KCS board considered:\n\u2022\nthe course and history of KCS\u2019s discussions and competitive negotiations with Party A and CN, including: (i) the fact that, after six\nrounds of bidding, Party A\u2019s last proposal to acquire KCS for\n66\nTable of Contents\n$250.00 per share in cash was significantly lower in value than both CN\u2019s and CPRL\u2019s proposals and did not offer the opportunity for\nongoing participation in the combined company\u2019s future performance\u037e and (ii) the fact that CN determined that it was unwilling to\nincrease the consideration or otherwise enhance the transaction terms offered in its proposal to acquire KCS following the\nannouncement by the STB of its unanimous decision to reject CN\u2019s proposed voting trust\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the STB had already approved the CPRL voting trust, and that the merger agreement, including the form of voting trust,\nwas substantially identical to the prior CP merger agreement but for the increase in the share consideration of the merger\nconsideration\u037e\n\u2022\nthe confidence of CPRL in its ability to obtain approval for the full combination of CPRL and KCS as demonstrated by its willingness\nto close into a voting trust, as more fully described below under \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that, in the six months following public announcement of the prior CP merger agreement, no party other than CN had\nsubmitted a competing proposal, and the fact that the merger agreement, like the CN agreement, would permit KCS to terminate the\nmerger agreement to accept a superior proposal, subject to certain conditions, were an unsolicited proposal to be made after\nannouncement of the transaction, as more fully described below under \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement\u201d\u037e\nOpinions of KCS\u2019s Financial Advisors\n\u2022\nThe KCS board considered the financial presentations by KCS\u2019s financial advisors and the oral opinion of each such financial advisor\nrendered to the KCS board, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 15, 2021, to the effect that, as of such\ndate and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, the procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations\non the scope of the review undertaken by such financial advisor, as set forth in such financial advisor\u2019s written opinion, the consideration\nto be received by the holders of KCS common stock (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) in the\ntransaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of each of Morgan Stanley and BofA\nSecurities is attached to this proxy statement as Annexes B and C, respectively, and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in\nits entirety. See also the sections entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Opinion of Morgan Stanley\u201d and \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014\nOpinion of BofA Securities\u201d on pages 72 and 85, respectively\u037e\nTiming and Likelihood of Completion of the Transaction\n\u2022\nThe KCS board considered the willingness of CPRL to close into a voting trust, allowing KCS stockholders to receive the merger\nconsideration immediately following the completion of the voting trust transaction, which is currently expected to be completed by the first\nquarter of 2022, rather than waiting for CPRL to obtain STB final approval from the STB before KCS stockholders would receive the merger\nconsideration\u037e\n\u2022\nThe KCS board considered the limited closing conditions to the completion of the transaction, the absence of a financing condition or\nsimilar contingency that is based on CPRL\u2019s ability to obtain financing and the strong commitment made by CPRL to obtain regulatory\napprovals, as further described in the section entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction\u201d\non page 110 and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Filings and Efforts\u037e Other Actions\u201d on page 160\u037e\nTerms of the Merger Agreement\n\u2022\nThe KCS board considered the ability of KCS, subject to specified limitations, to respond to and\n67\nTable of Contents\nengage in discussions regarding unsolicited third-party acquisition proposals under certain circumstances and, ultimately, to terminate the\nmerger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal to the merger with CPRL, subject to\ncompliance with the procedural terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement and the payment of the $700.0 million CP termination\npayment to CPRL and the $700.0 million CN termination amount refund, as further discussed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\n\u2014Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement\u201d on page 164\u037e\n\u2022\nThe KCS board considered the terms of the merger agreement that restrict CPRL\u2019s ability to solicit alternative business combination\ntransactions and to provide information to, or engage in discussions with, a third party interested in pursuing an alternative business\ncombination transaction with CPRL, as further discussed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No-Solicitation\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nThe KCS board considered the obligation of CPRL to pay to KCS a termination payment of $1.0 billion upon termination of the merger\nagreement under specified circumstances, including if (i) the transaction has not been consummated by February 21, 2022 (or, in the event\nthe authorizations required to be obtained from COFECE and the IFT with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\nare the only outstanding conditions to be satisfied or waived as of February 21, 2022, by May 21, 2022) because there is an injunction or\nsimilar order prohibiting the transaction or the voting trust transaction arising out of the STB review process or under Section 721 or (ii)\nsuch an injunction or order has become final and non-appealable, in each case, as further discussed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement\u201d on page 164\u037e\nGovernance Matters\n\u2022\nThe KCS board considered the fact that, following STB final approval (or at such earlier date following the closing of the transaction as may\nbe approved by the STB), four KCS directors will be appointed to the CPRL board, which will allow for oversight of and input into the\nstrategy of the combined company\u037e\nThe KCS board weighed these factors that it viewed as supporting the merger agreement and the transaction against a number of potentially negative\nfactors, including:\n\u2022\nthe fact that completion of the transaction depends on certain factors outside of KCS\u2019s control, including regulatory approvals and CPRL\nshareholder approval, and that there can be no assurance that the conditions to the transaction will be satisfied even if the merger proposal\nis approved by KCS stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential consequences of non-consummation of the transaction, including the potential negative impacts on KCS, its business and the\ntrading price of its shares of common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nCPRL\u2019s unwillingness to agree to adjustments in the fixed exchange ratio to protect against any decrease in the trading price of CPRL\ncommon shares prior to the consummation of the transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nthe terms of the merger agreement that restrict KCS\u2019s ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals and to provide information to, or\nengage in discussions with, a third party interested in pursuing an alternative acquisition proposal, as further discussed in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation\u201d on page 151, though the KCS board also considered that such terms do not prevent\nsuch discussions if certain criteria are met\u037e\n\u2022\nthe obligation of KCS to pay to CPRL the CP termination payment of $700.0 million upon termination of the merger agreement and to pay to\nCPRL the $700.0 million CN termination amount refund in the event KCS accepts a superior proposal, though the KCS board determined that\nthe obligation was reasonable and not preclusive or coercive\u037e\n68\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe potential for diversion of management and employee attention, and potential retention challenges, due to the possible effects of the\nannouncement and pendency of the transaction, though the KCS board also considered and approved a retention program and severance\narrangements in connection with the transaction, as discussed in the sections entitled \u201cInterests of KCS\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\nin the Transaction\u2014Executive Severance Arrangements\u201d on page 103 and \u201cInterests of KCS\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nTransaction\u2014Retention Program\u201d on page 105\u037e\n\u2022\nthe difficulty and costs inherent in integrating large and diverse businesses\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that forecasts of future results of operations and synergies are necessarily estimates based on assumptions, and that for these and\nother reasons there is a risk of not realizing anticipated performance or capturing potential synergies and other benefits expected to be\nobtained as a result of the transaction\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe risks and other considerations of the type and nature described under the sections entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d on page 22 and \u201cCautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 37.\nThe KCS board considered the factors described above as a whole, including through engaging in discussions with KCS senior management and KCS\u2019s\noutside legal and financial advisors. Based on this review and consideration, the KCS board unanimously concluded that these factors, on balance,\nsupported a determination that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the transaction, were\nadvisable and in the best interests of KCS stockholders, and to make its recommendation to KCS stockholders that they vote to adopt the merger\nagreement.\nIn addition, the KCS board was aware of and considered the fact that KCS\u2019s directors and executive officers may have certain interests in the transaction\nthat are different from, or in addition to, the interests of KCS stockholders generally, including the treatment of equity awards held by such directors and\nexecutive officers in the transaction, as described in the section entitled \u201cInterests of KCS\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction\u201d on page\n102.\nThe foregoing discussion describes the material factors that the KCS board considered, but is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive. The KCS board\ncollectively reached the conclusion to approve the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,\nincluding the merger, in light of the various factors described above and other factors that the members of the KCS board believed appropriate. In view of\nthe complexity and wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, that the KCS board considered in connection with its evaluation of the\ntransaction, the KCS board did not find it useful to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or specific weights or values to any\nof the factors it considered in reaching its decision. In considering the factors discussed above, individual directors may have given different weights to\ndifferent factors.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the KCS board in approving the merger agreement is forward-looking in nature.\nThis information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d\non page 37.\nBoard of Directors and Management of CPRL after the Transaction",

            "text": "CPRL\u2019s Reasons for the Transaction\nAt its meeting held on September 11, 2021, after due consideration and extensive consultation with CPRL\u2019s management and outside legal and financial\nadvisors to both CPRL and the CPRL board, the CPRL board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement and authorized the issuance of CPRL common shares under the merger agreement. In doing so, the CPRL board considered the\nbusiness, assets and liabilities, results of operations, financial performance, strategic direction and prospects of CPRL and KCS, with a view to the best\ninterests of CPRL. In making its determination, the CPRL board considered a number of factors (which are not necessarily presented in order of relative\nimportance) with a view to the best interests of CPRL, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe creation, as a result of the transaction, of the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico and Canada and the expected ability to\ndeliver significantly expanded market reach for customers served by CPRL and KCS and provide new competitive transportation service\noptions, including new single-line hauls across the combined company\u2019s continent-wide network, while improving route efficiency and\nreducing transit times\u037e the expected benefits to CPRL\u2019s business, assets, financial condition, results of operations, business plan and\nprospects after CPRL\u2019s combination with KCS following receipt of STB final approval, including the expected pro forma effect of the\ntransaction on the combined company\u037e\n\u2022\nthe expectation that, after CPRL\u2019s combination with KCS following receipt of STB final approval, a single integrated rail system will connect\npremier ports on the U.S. Gulf, Atlantic and Pacific coasts with key overseas markets, and that CPRL and KCS\u2019s combined network will result\nin increased efficiency and simplicity for the combined company\u2019s customers, including grain, automotive, auto-parts, energy, intermodal\nand other shippers\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that CPRL\u2019s and KCS\u2019s cultures are aligned and rooted in the highest safety, service and performance standards and that CPRL\nand KCS are both committed to improving sustainability and have made science-based pledges in-line with the Paris Agreement to improve\nfuel efficiency and lower emissions in support of a more sustainable North American supply chain\u037e\n\u2022\nthe expectation that the combination will create a more competitive network, while remaining the smallest of six U.S. Class 1 railroads by\nrevenue, and spur greater rail-to-rail competition and greater support for customers in growing their rail volumes\u037e\n\u2022\nCPRL management\u2019s identification of approximately $1,000 million in annualized synergies (comprised of cost savings of $180 million and\n$820 million in EBITDA growth from market opportunities) expected to be realized within the first three years

attractive opportunity for CPRL and that its review did not present a better alternative\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of CPRL, in specified circumstances, to provide information to and to engage in

following:\n\u2022\nthe risk that the KCS stockholders may not approve the KCS merger proposal or that CPRL shareholders may not approve the issuance of\nCPRL common shares to KCS common stockholders

transaction to CPRL\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk of diverting the attention of CPRL\u2019s senior management from other strategic priorities to implement the transaction and make\narrangements for integration of CPRL\u2019s and KCS\u2019s operations and infrastructure following receipt of STB final approval\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain restrictions on the conduct of CPRL\u2019s business during the

At the meeting of the KCS board on\nSeptember 15, 2021, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 15, 2021, to the KCS\nboard to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be\nreceived by the holders of shares of KCS common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of\nview to such holders of KCS common stock.\nThe full text of Morgan Stanley\u2019s written opinion to the KCS board, dated September 15, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in\nrendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The foregoing\nsummary of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read Morgan\nStanley\u2019s opinion and the summary of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion below carefully and in their entirety. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was for the benefit of\nthe KCS board, in its capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger consideration to be received by the\nholders of shares of KCS common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion and did not\naddress any other aspects or implications of the transaction. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a\nrecommendation as to how the shareholders of KCS or CPRL should vote at the shareholder meetings to be held in connection with the transaction.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:\n(a)\nreviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of KCS and CPRL, respectively\u037e\n(b)\nreviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning KCS and CPRL, respectively\u037e\n(c)\nreviewed the KCS management unaudited KCS projections, the KCS management assumed synergies and the KCS management unaudited\nCPRL projections (each as defined and described in the below section entitled \u201cKCS Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d), in each\ncase prepared by the management of KCS\u037e\n(d)\nreviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the transaction, prepared by the\nmanagements of KCS and CPRL, respectively\u037e\n(e)\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of KCS, including information relating to certain\nstrategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the transaction, with senior executives of KCS\u037e\n(f)\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of CPRL, including information relating to certain\nstrategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the transaction, with senior executives of CPRL\u037e\n(g)\nreviewed the reported prices and trading activity for KCS common stock and CPRL common shares\u037e\n(h)\ncompared the financial performance of KCS and CPRL and the prices and trading activity of KCS common stock and CPRL common shares\nwith that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with KCS and CPRL, respectively, and their securities\u037e\n(i)\nreviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions\u037e\n(j)\nparticipated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of KCS and CPRL and certain parties and their financial and\nlegal advisors\u037e\n73\nTable of Contents\n(k)\nreviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated September 10, 2021 (the \u201cdraft agreement\u201d), the debt commitment letters, the STB May 6\ndecision, the form of the voting trust agreement, and certain related documents\u037e and\n(l)\nperformed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information\nthat was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by KCS and CPRL, respectively, and formed a substantial basis for\nits opinion. With respect to the KCS management unaudited KCS projections and the KCS management assumed synergies, Morgan Stanley assumed\nthat they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of KCS of the future\nfinancial performance of KCS. With respect to the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they were reasonably\nprepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of KCS of the future financial performance of CPRL,\nincluding following consummation of the transaction. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the transaction will be consummated in accordance with\nthe terms set forth in the merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, (i) that the\ntransaction will be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Code, (ii) that CPRL will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in\nthe debt commitment letters, (iii) that the STB will permit the transaction to close into the voting trust in accordance with the terms of the STB May 6\ndecision and the voting trust agreement and (iv) that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft agreement.\nMorgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for\nthe transaction, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits\nexpected to be derived in the transaction. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the managements of KCS and\nCPRL of: (i) the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from the transaction\u037e (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of\nKCS and CPRL\u037e (iii) their ability to retain key employees of KCS and CPRL, respectively, and (iv) the validity of, and risks associated with, KCS and\nCPRL\u2019s existing and future technologies, intellectual property, products, services and business models. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory\nadvisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of CPRL and KCS and their legal,\ntax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount\nor nature of the compensation to any of KCS\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration to be\nreceived by the holders of shares of KCS common stock in the transaction. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to KCS, nor does it\naddress the underlying business decision of KCS to enter into the merger agreement or proceed with any other transaction contemplated by the merger\nagreement. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the treatment of the KCS preferred stock, in the transaction. Morgan Stanley did not\nmake any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of KCS or CPRL, nor was it furnished with any such valuations or appraisals.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available\nto Morgan Stanley as of, the date of its opinion. Events occurring after such date may affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the assumptions used in\npreparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with the preparation of its opinion to the KCS\nboard. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by\nMorgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those\nanalyses. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses\nused by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the\n74\nTable of Contents\ntext of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described\nbelow must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and\nfactors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion. Morgan Stanley considered a number of\nfactors in analyzing the merger consideration. The fact that points in the ranges of implied equity value per share of KCS common stock derived below\nwere less than or greater than the merger consideration is not necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis of the merger\nconsideration, but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent\nthat it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before September 13, 2021 and is not necessarily indicative of current market\nconditions.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the KCS board, used and relied\nupon the KCS management unaudited KCS projections, the KCS management assumed synergies and the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections.\nFor more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal \u2013 KCS Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation\u201d on page 96.\nAnalyses Related to KCS\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the present value\nof the estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied equity values per\nshare of KCS common stock as of June 30, 2021, based on estimates of future unlevered free cash flows for the six months ending December 31, 2021 and\nfiscal years 2022 through 2029 contained in the KCS management unaudited KCS projections, including net debt of KCS as of June 30, 2021 of $3,787\nmillion. Morgan Stanley also calculated a range of terminal values for KCS based on next twelve months (\u201cNTM\u201d) EBITDA exit multiple range of 10.75x to\n12.25x, which was selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. The estimated unlevered free cash flows and the range of\nterminal values were then discounted to June 30, 2021 by applying a discount rate range of 6.1% to 7.3%, which was selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nprofessional judgment and experience, to reflect KCS\u2019s estimated weighted average cost of capital. Morgan Stanley used a discount rate range of 6.1% to\n7.3% to reflect KCS\u2019s estimated weighted average cost of capital, which was calculated by multiplying the cost of each capital source (debt and equity)\nby its relevant weight, and then adding the products together to determine the value. Cost of equity was calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing\nModel (\u201cCAPM\u201d). The CAPM takes into account market risk premium, risk-free rate and beta of the underlying stock. Morgan Stanley used an EBITDA\nexit multiple range of 10.75x to 12.25x based on KCS\u2019s and comparable companies\u2019 EBITDA multiples over time.\nThis analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock of $226.00 to $280.00, in each case rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nMorgan Stanley compared the foregoing range of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock to the closing trading price of KCS common\nstock as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $224.16 and\nthe implied value of the merger consideration to be received by holders of shares of KCS common stock in the transaction as of September 13, 2021 of\n$288.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nComparable Public Company Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a comparable public company analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar\ncompanies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and\n75\nTable of Contents\ncompared certain financial information of KCS with corresponding publicly available financial information for other Class 1 Rail companies that shared\ncertain similar characteristics to KCS to derive an implied valuation range for KCS. The companies used in this comparison were the following:\n\u2022\nCPRL\n\u2022\nCN\n\u2022\nUnion Pacific Corporation\n\u2022\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n\u2022\nCSX Corporation\nThe above companies were chosen based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s knowledge of the industry and because they have businesses that may be considered\nsimilar to KCS\u2019s. Although none of such companies are identical or directly comparable to KCS, these companies are publicly traded companies with\noperations and/or other criteria, such as lines of business, markets, business risks, growth prospects, maturity of business and size and scale of business,\nthat for purposes of its analysis Morgan Stanley considered similar to KCS.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the following statistics of each of these companies, based on public filings, publicly available\nresearch estimates and publicly available financial information published by Capital IQ as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the\nannouncement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) for KCS and CPRL, as of April 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the\nannouncement of the CN proposal) for CN and as of September 13, 2021 for Union Pacific Corporation, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX\nCorporation:\n\u2022\nthe ratio of aggregate value (\u201cAV\u201d), calculated as the market value of equity plus short-term debt, long-term debt, preferred equity and non-\ncontrolling interests, net of cash, cash equivalents and investments to estimated fiscal year 2022 EBITDA (which is referred to below as the\n\u201c2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe ratio of stock price to estimated fiscal year 2022 earnings per share (which is referred to below as the \u201c2022E P/E Ratio\u201d).\nThe results of Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis were presented for the comparable companies, as indicated in the following table:\n2022E\nAV/EBITDA\nRatio\n2022E\nP/E\nRatio\nKCS\n13.4x\n21.4x\nCPRL\n14.6x\n21.1x\nCN\n14.2x\n22.5x\nUnion Pacific Corporation\n12.9x\n18.3x\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n12.4x\n18.4x\nCSX Corporation\n11.8x\n18.1x\nMean\n13.2x\n20.0x\nMedian\n13.2x\n19.8x\nBased on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,\nMorgan Stanley selected representative ranges of 2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio and 2022E P/E Ratio and applied these ranges to KCS\u2019s estimated fiscal year\n2022 EBITDA of $1,839 million based on consensus analyst estimates and of $1,827 million based on the KCS management unaudited KCS projections,\nand to KCS\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2021 earnings per share of $10.50 based on consensus analyst estimates and of $10.75 based on the KCS management\nunaudited KCS projections. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized the KCS management unaudited KCS projections and\n76\nTable of Contents\nconsensus analyst estimates. Morgan Stanley then calculated a range of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock as follows, in each case\nrounded to the nearest $1.00:\nSelected\nRepresentative\nRange\nImplied Equity Value\nPer Share of KCS\nCommon Stock\n2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio (KCS management unaudited KCS\nprojections)\n12.0x \u2013 14.5x\n$\n199.00-$248.00\n2022E P/E Ratio (KCS management unaudited KCS projections)\n18.5x \u2013 22.5x\n$\n199.00-$242.00\n2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio (Consensus)\n12.0x \u2013 14.5x\n$\n200.00-$250.00\n2022E P/E Ratio (Consensus)\n18.5x \u2013 22.5x\n$\n194.00-$236.00\nMorgan Stanley compared the foregoing ranges of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock to the closing trading price of KCS common\nstock as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $224.16 per\nshare and the implied value of the merger consideration to be received by holders of shares of KCS common stock in the transaction as of September 13,\n2021 of $288.00 per share, rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nNo company included in the comparable public company analysis is identical to KCS. In evaluating comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made\njudgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which\nare beyond the control of KCS. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the business of KCS and the industry generally, industry\ngrowth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of KCS and the industry, and in the financial markets in\ngeneral. Mathematical analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.\nMorgan Stanley used a 12.0x to 14.5x representative range for 2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio for both KCS and CPRL. This range was based on market data\nmultiples for KCS, CPRL and the four other public Class 1 railroads (CN, Union Pacific Corporation, CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern Corporation).\nThe KCS and CPRL market data were as of March 19, 2021 (the unaffected date for KCS\u2019s share price), the CN market data was as of April 19, 2021 (the\nunaffected date for CN\u2019s share price), and the Union Pacific Corporation, CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern Corporation market data were as of\nSeptember 13, 2021.\nSummary Statistics for 2022E AV / EBITDA Ratio\nMinimum\n11.8x\nMedian\n13.2x\nMean\n13.2x\nMaximum\n14.6x\nMorgan Stanley used a 18.5x to 22.5x representative range for 2022E P/E Ratio for both KCS and CPRL.

The KCS and\nCPRL market data were as of March 19, 2021 (the unaffected date for KCS\u2019s share price), the CN market data was as of April 19, 2021 (the unaffected date\nfor CN\u2019s share price), and the Union Pacific Corporation, CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern Corporation market data were as of September 13, 2021.\nSummary Statistics for 2022E P / E Ratio\nMinimum\n18.1x\nMedian\n19.8x\nMean\n20.0x\nMaximum\n22.5x\n77\nTable of Contents\nPrecedent Transactions and Premia Paid Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which attempts to imply a value of a company based on publicly available financial terms\nand premia of selected transactions. Morgan Stanley reviewed the publicly available financial information for certain transactions in the railroad industry\nsince June 1994.\nFor purposes of this analysis, based on publicly available financial information, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of the implied AV to last twelve\nmonths EBITDA, referred to as the AV/LTM EBITDA Ratio, for each of the target companies in the selected transactions. The transactions reviewed, the\ndate that each transaction was announced and the corresponding AV/LTM EBITDA Ratios were as follows:\nDate Announced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nAV/LTM\nEBITDA\nRatio\nTransaction\nValue\n(in\nmillions)\nJuly 2019\nBrookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. / GIC Pte.\nLtd.\nGenesee & Wyoming Inc.\n13.4x\n$8,432\nMarch 2017\nGMexico Transportes S.A. de C.V.\nFlorida East Coast Railway Holdings Corp.\n13.6x\n$2,100\nOctober 2016\nGenesee & Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd.\nGlencore Rail (NSW) Pty Limited\n11.4x\n(1)\n$866\nOctober 2016\nMacquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets\nGenesee & Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd.

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the precedent transactions and upon the application of its professional\njudgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected a representative range of AV/LTM EBITDA Ratio and applied this range to KCS\u2019s last 12 months\n(\u201cLTM\u201d) COVID-Adjusted EBITDA as of June 30, 2021 of $1,600 million as provided by KCS management, which reflects an add-back of $128 million, as\nprovided by KCS management, for the estimated impact of COVID-19 for the third and the fourth quarters of 2020.\nBased on this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock as follows, in each case rounded to\nthe nearest $1.00:\nSelected\nRepresentative\nRange\nImplied Equity Value\nPer Share of KCS\nCommon Stock\nAV/LTM EBITDA Ratio\n11.0x \u2013 15.0x\n$\n151.00 \u2013 $221.00\nMorgan Stanley also reviewed the premia paid for transactions announced between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2020 with a publicly announced\ntransaction value of more than $1,000 million, as published by Thomson Reuters. The premia paid were calculated based on each of (i) the target\ncompany\u2019s closing stock price and (ii) the 52-week high of the target company\u2019s stock price, in each case on the last trading day prior to the public\nannouncement of the transactions. Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,\nMorgan Stanley (A) selected a representative range of premia of 15% to 35% with respect to the target companies\u2019 closing stock prices and applied this\nrange of premia to the closing trading price of KCS common stock as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the\nexecution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $224.16 and (B) selected a representative range of premia of (5%) to 20% with respect to the 52-week highs\nof such target companies\u2019 stock prices and applied this range of premia to the 52-week high price per share of KCS common stock as of March 19, 2021\n(which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $224.16.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s premia paid analysis was based on precedent transactions with transaction values greater than $1,000 million from 2007 to 2020. The\nmultiple range of 11.0x to 15.0x for the precedent transactions analysis was selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional experience and judgment.\nThese analyses indicated ranges of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock of (i) $258.00 to $303.00 and (ii) $213.00 to $269.00, respectively,\nin each case rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nMorgan Stanley compared the foregoing ranges of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock to the closing trading price of KCS common\nstock as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $224.16, and\nthe implied value of the merger consideration to be received by holders of shares of KCS common stock in the transaction as of September 13, 2021 of\n$288.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nNo company or transaction used in the precedent transactions or premia paid analysis is identical to KCS or the transaction. In evaluating the precedent\ntransactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KCS. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the business of\nKCS or the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of KCS or the\nindustry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of using precedent transactions data.\n79\nTable of Contents\nOther Factors\nMorgan Stanley observed certain additional factors that were not considered part of its financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced\nfor informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nHistorical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed the low and high\nper share trading range of shares of KCS common stock for the 12-month period ending March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior\nto the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement). Morgan Stanley observed that during such period the trading\nrange was $101.00 to $224.00 per share of KCS common stock, rounded to the nearest $1.00.\n\u2022\nEquity Research Analysts\u2019 Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed the\nundiscounted price targets for shares of KCS common stock prepared and published by 20 equity research analysts as of March 19, 2021\n(which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement). These targets generally\nreflect each analyst\u2019s estimate of the future public market trading price of shares of KCS common stock. In order to better compare the\nequity analysts\u2019 stock price targets with the merger consideration, Morgan Stanley discounted each analyst\u2019s price target to present value\nby applying, for a one year discount period, a discount rate of 7.4%, selected by Morgan Stanley based on the application of its\nprofessional judgment and experience to reflect KCS\u2019s cost of equity. This analysis resulted in a discounted analyst price target range for\nshares of KCS common stock of $186.00 to $239.00 per share, rounded to the nearest $1.00. Morgan Stanley used a discount rate of 7.4% to\nreflect KCS\u2019s estimated cost of equity. Cost of equity was calculated using the CAPM. The CAPM takes into account market risk premium,\nrisk-free rate and beta of the underlying stock.\n\u2022\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley performed a\ndiscounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into a theoretical estimate of the future implied value of a company\u2019s\ncommon equity as a function of such company\u2019s estimated future earnings and a theoretical range of trading multiples. The resulting\nestimated future implied value of equity is subsequently discounted back to the present day at the company\u2019s cost of equity in order to\narrive at an illustrative estimate of the present value for the company\u2019s theoretical future implied stock price. Morgan Stanley used a\ndiscount rate of 7.4% to reflect KCS\u2019s estimated cost of equity. Cost of equity was calculated using the CAPM. The CAPM takes into\naccount market risk premium, risk-free rate and beta of the underlying stock. Morgan Stanley used a NTM P/E multiple range of 17.0x to\n21.0x based on KCS\u2019s and comparable companies\u2019 NTM P/E multiples over time.\nIn arriving at the estimated equity values per share of KCS common stock, Morgan Stanley selected a representative range of ratio of stock\nprice to future earnings per share (\u201cP/E Multiple\u201d) utilizing the next 12 months (\u201cNTM\u201d) estimated earnings per share and applied this range\nof multiples to an estimate of fiscal year 2029 earnings per share from the KCS management unaudited KCS projections. Morgan Stanley\nthen discounted the resulting equity values per share to June 30, 2021 at a discount rate of 7.4%, selected by Morgan Stanley based on the\napplication of its professional judgment and experience to reflect KCS\u2019s cost of equity. Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived a\nrange of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock as follows, each rounded to the nearest $1.00:\nSelected\nRepresentative\nRange\nImplied Equity Value\nPer\nShare of KCS\ncommon stock\nP/E Multiple\n17.0x\u201321.0x\n$\n269.00\u2013$328.00\n80\nTable of Contents\nAnalyses Related to CPRL\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the present value\nof the estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied equity values per\nCPRL common share as of June 30, 2021, based on estimates of future unlevered free cash flows for the six months ending December 31, 2021 and fiscal\nyears 2022 through 2029 contained in the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections, including net debt of CPRL as of June 30, 2021 of $6,027 million.\nMorgan Stanley also calculated a range of terminal values for CPRL based on NTM EBITDA exit multiple range of 11.75x to 13.25x, which was selected\nbased on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. The estimated unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then\ndiscounted to June 30, 2021 by applying a discount rate range of 5.4% to 6.7%, which was selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment\nand experience, to reflect CPRL\u2019s estimated weighted average cost of capital. Morgan Stanley used a discount rate range of 5.4% to 6.7% to reflect CPRL\u2019s\nestimated weighted average cost of capital, which was calculated by multiplying the cost of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight,\nand then adding the products together to determine the value. Cost of equity was calculated using the CAPM. The CAPM takes into account market risk\npremium, risk-free rate and beta of the underlying stock. Morgan Stanley used an EBITDA exit multiple range of 11.75x to 13.25x based on CPRL\u2019s and\ncomparable companies\u2019 EBITDA multiples over time.\nThis analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per CPRL common share of $76.00 to $93.00, in each case rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nMorgan Stanley compared the foregoing range of implied equity values per CPRL common share to the closing trading price of CPRL common shares on\nSeptember 13, 2021 of $68.55 and to the closing trading price per CPRL common share on March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the\nannouncement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $75.70 (taking into account the share split).\nComparable Public Company Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a comparable public company analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar\ncompanies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial information of CPRL with corresponding publicly available\nfinancial information for other Class 1 Rail companies that shared certain similar characteristics to CPRL to derive an implied valuation range for CPRL.\nThe companies used in this comparison were the following:\n\u2022\nKCS\n\u2022\nCN\n\u2022\nUnion Pacific Corporation\n\u2022\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n\u2022\nCSX Corporation\nThe above companies were chosen based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s knowledge of the industry and because they have businesses that may be considered\nsimilar to CPRL\u2019s. Although none of such companies are identical or directly comparable to CPRL, these companies are publicly traded companies with\noperations and/or other criteria, such as lines of business, markets, business risks, growth prospects, maturity of business and size and scale of business,\nthat for purposes of its analysis Morgan Stanley considered similar to CPRL.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the following statistics of each of these companies, based on public filings, publicly available\nresearch estimates and publicly available financial information published by\n81\nTable of Contents\nCapital IQ as of March 19, 2021(which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) for KCS and\nCPRL, as of April 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the CN proposal) for CN and as of September 13, 2021 for Union\nPacific Corporation, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Corporation:\n\u2022\nthe 2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe 2022E P/E Ratio.\nThe results of Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis were presented for the comparable companies, as indicated in the following table:\n2022E\nAV/EBITDA\nRatio\n2022\nE P/E\nRatio\nKCS\n13.4x\n21.4x\nCPRL\n14.6x\n21.1x\nCN\n14.2x\n22.5x\nUnion Pacific Corporation\n12.9x\n18.3x\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n12.4x\n18.4x\nCSX Corporation\n11.8x\n18.1x\nMean\n13.2x\n20.0x\nMedian\n13.2x\n19.8x\nBased on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,\nMorgan Stanley selected representative ranges of 2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio and 2022E P/E Ratio and applied these ranges to CPRL\u2019s estimated fiscal year\n2022 EBITDA of $3,900 million based on consensus analyst estimates and of $3,862 million based on the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections,\nand to CPRL\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2022 earnings per share of $3.63 based on consensus analyst estimates and of $3.67 based on the KCS management\nunaudited CPRL projections. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections and consensus\nanalyst estimates.\nMorgan Stanley then calculated a range of implied equity values per CPRL common share as follows, in each case rounded to the nearest $1.00:\nSelected\nRepresentative\nRange\nImplied Equity\nValue\nPer CPRL\nCommon Share\n2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio (KCS management\nunaudited CPRL projections)\n12.0x \u2013 14.5x\n$\n60.00-$74.00\n2022E P/E Ratio (KCS management unaudited\nCPRL projections)\n18.5x \u2013 22.5x\n$\n68.00-$82.00\n2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio (Consensus)\n12.0x \u2013 14.5x\n$\n61.00-$75.00\n2022E P/E Ratio (Consensus)\n18.5x \u2013 22.5x\n$\n67.00-$82.00\nMorgan Stanley compared the foregoing ranges of implied equity values per CPRL common share to the closing trading price of CPRL common shares on\nSeptember 13, 2021 of $68.55 and to the closing trading price on March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the\nexecution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $75.70.\n82\nTable of Contents\nNo company included in the comparable public company analysis is identical to CPRL. In evaluating comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made\njudgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which\nare beyond the control of CPRL. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the business of CPRL and the industry generally,\nindustry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of CPRL and the industry, and in the financial\nmarkets in general. Mathematical analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.\nOther Factors\nMorgan Stanley observed certain additional factors that were not considered part of its financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced\nfor informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nHistorical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed the low and high\nper share trading range of CPRL common shares for the 12-month period ending March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the\nannouncement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement). Morgan Stanley observed that during such period the trading range was\n$36.00 to $77.00 per CPRL common share (taking into account the share split), rounded to the nearest $1.00.\n\u2022\nEquity Research Analysts\u2019 Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed the\nundiscounted price targets for CPRL common shares prepared and published by 24 equity research analysts as of March 19, 2021 (which\nwas the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement). These targets generally reflect each\nanalyst\u2019s estimate of the future public market trading price of CPRL common shares. In order to better compare the equity analysts\u2019 stock\nprice targets with the trading price of CPRL common shares on September 13, 2021 of $68.55 and to the closing trading price of $75.70 on\nMarch 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the execution of the prior CP merger agreement), Morgan Stanley discounted each\nanalyst\u2019s price target to present value by applying, for a one year discount period, a discount rate of 6.4%, selected by Morgan Stanley\nbased on the application of its professional judgment and experience to reflect CPRL\u2019s cost of equity. This analysis resulted in a discounted\nanalyst price target range for CPRL common shares of $64.00 to $76.00 per share, rounded to the nearest $1.00. Morgan Stanley used a\ndiscount rate of 6.4% to reflect CPRL\u2019s estimated cost of equity. Cost of equity was calculated using the CAPM. The CAPM takes into\naccount market risk premium, risk-free rate and beta of the underlying stock.\nSummary of Material Pro Forma Financial Analysis\nHas/Gets Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a Has/Gets Analysis to calculate the theoretical change in value for holders of KCS common stock resulting from the\ntransaction based on a comparison of (i) the pro forma ownership by holders of KCS common stock of CPRL giving effect to the transaction, and (ii) the\n100% ownership by holders of KCS common stock of the KCS common stock on a standalone basis. For KCS common stock on a standalone basis,\nMorgan Stanley used the reference range obtained in the discounted cash flow analysis described above under \u201cSummary of Material Financial\nAnalyses of KCS \u2013 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.\u201d Morgan Stanley then performed the same analysis by calculating the range of implied per share\nequity values allocable to holders of KCS common stock on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the transaction, by assuming approximately 28% pro forma\nownership, based on the number of CPRL common shares estimated to be issued to holders of KCS common stock in the transaction, utilizing the results\nof the standalone discounted cash flow analyses for KCS and CPRL described above under \u201cSummary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS \u2013\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\u201d and under \u201cSummary of Material Financial Analyses of CPRL \u2013 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,\u201d and\n83\nTable of Contents\ntaking into account the KCS management assumed synergies on the basis of (1) a projected $990 million in EBITDA synergies as provided by KCS\nmanagement (referred to in this section as the \u201c$990 million synergy case\u201d), which also included $20 million of projected D&A and Capex synergies, for\ntotal projected gross synergies of $1,010 million, and (2) a projected $377 million in EBITDA synergies as provided by KCS management (referred to in\nthis section as the \u201c$377 million synergy case\u201d), which also included $23 million of projected D&A and Capex synergies for total projected gross\nsynergies of $400 million. Morgan Stanley then compared these implied per share equity value ranges, which were further adjusted by an estimated\nadditional net debt from the transaction and $90.00 per share cash merger consideration, to the implied per share equity value ranges derived for KCS\ncommon stock on a standalone basis utilizing the results of the standalone discounted cash flow analysis for KCS described above.\nThis analysis yielded the following implied per share equity value ranges for KCS common stock on a standalone and on a pro forma basis (rounded to\nthe nearest $1.00):\nImplied Equity Value Per Share of KCS common stock\nStandalone\nPro-Forma $990\nmillion synergy case\nPro-Forma $377\nmillion synergy case\n$226.00 - $280.00\n$310.00 - $365.00\n$291.00 - $343.00\nOther Considerations\nIn connection with the review of the transaction by the KCS board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for\npurposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or\nsummary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular\nweight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a\nwhole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various\nanalyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other\nassumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nview of the actual value of KCS or CPRL.\nIn performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic,\nmarket and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KCS or CPRL. These include, among other things, the impact of\ncompetition on the businesses of KCS and CPRL or the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the\nfinancial condition and prospects of KCS, CPRL or the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nanalyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such\nestimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger\nconsideration to be received by the holders of shares of KCS common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement, and in\nconnection with the delivery of its opinion to the KCS board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of\nKCS common stock or CPRL common shares might actually trade.\nThe merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of KCS common stock was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between KCS\nand CPRL and was approved by the KCS board. Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to the KCS board during these negotiations but did not,\nhowever, recommend any specific merger consideration to KCS, nor opine that any specific merger consideration constituted the only appropriate merger\nconsideration for the transaction. In addition, Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion does not in any manner address the prices at which CPRL common shares will\ntrade following consummation of the transaction or at any other time and Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how KCS\u2019s or\nCPRL\u2019s shareholders should vote at any shareholder meetings to be held in connection with the transaction.\n84\nTable of Contents\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the KCS board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the KCS board in deciding to\napprove the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the recommendation of the KCS\nboard with respect to the merger consideration or of whether the KCS board would have been willing to agree to different merger consideration. Morgan\nStanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with its customary\npractice.\nKCS has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley for its services in connection with the transaction an aggregate fee, which is currently estimated, based on the\ninformation available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $63 million, a portion of which was paid upon the execution and announcement\nof the prior CP merger agreement in March 2021, a portion of which was paid to Morgan Stanley upon the rendering of a fairness opinion in connection\nwith the CN agreement announced in May 2021, a portion of which was payable upon the rendering of its opinion in connection with the transaction and\nthe remainder of which is payable upon the closing of the transaction. KCS has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for certain of its expenses\nincurred in performing its services, including fees and expenses of outside counsel to Morgan Stanley. In addition, KCS has agreed to indemnify Morgan\nStanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its\naffiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nengagement.\nIn the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates have provided financial advisory and financing services to KCS and its\naffiliates and have received aggregate fees of approximately $5 million to $15 million in connection with such services (which includes the fee received\nupon delivery of its opinion in connection with the prior CP merger agreement announced in March 2021 and the fee received upon delivery of its opinion\nin connection with the CN agreement announced in May 2021). In addition, Morgan Stanley or one of its affiliates is currently a lender to each of KCS\nand CPRL under their respective revolving credit facilities, and is also currently engaged to provide financing services to CPRL that are unrelated to the\ntransaction, for which Morgan Stanley expects to receive customary fees. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing\nservices to KCS, CPRL and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.\nMorgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its\nsecurities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime\nbrokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at\nany time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and\neffect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of CPRL, KCS, their respective affiliates or\nany other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the transaction, or any related derivative instrument.\nOpinion of BofA Securities\nKCS retained BofA Securities to act as its financial advisor in connection with the transaction. BofA Securities is an internationally recognized investment\nbanking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated\nunderwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. KCS\nselected BofA Securities to act as KCS\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the transaction on the basis of BofA Securities\u2019 experience in transactions\nsimilar to the transaction, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with KCS and its business.\nOn September 15, 2021, at a meeting of the KCS board held to evaluate the transaction, BofA Securities delivered to the KCS board an oral opinion, which\nwas confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated\n85\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 15, 2021, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in BofA\nSecurities\u2019 written opinion, the merger consideration to be received in the transaction by holders of KCS common stock (other than \u201cexcluded shares\u201d)\nwas fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of BofA Securities\u2019 written opinion to the KCS board, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed,\nfactors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by\nreference herein in its entirety.

BofA Securities\u2019 opinion does not address any other aspect of the transaction and does not express any opinion or recommendation as\nto how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the transaction or any related matter.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Securities, among other things:\n(1)\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to KCS and CPRL\u037e\n(2)\nreviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of KCS furnished to or\ndiscussed with BofA Securities by the management of KCS, including the KCS management unaudited KCS projections (as defined and\ndescribed in the below section entitled \u201cKCS Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d) relating to KCS prepared by the management\nof KCS\u037e\n(3)\nreviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of CPRL furnished to or\ndiscussed with BofA Securities by the management of KCS, including the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections (as defined and\ndescribed in the below section entitled \u201cKCS Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,\u201d) relating to CPRL prepared by the management\nof KCS\u037e\n(4)\nreviewed the KCS management assumed synergies (as defined and described in the below section entitled \u201cKCS Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information\u201d) anticipated by the managements of KCS and CPRL to result from the transaction\u037e\n(5)\ndiscussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of KCS with members of senior managements of\nKCS and CPRL, and discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of CPRL with members of senior\nmanagements of KCS and CPRL\u037e\n(6)\nreviewed the trading histories for KCS common stock and CPRL common shares and a comparison of such trading histories with the trading\nhistories of other companies BofA Securities deemed relevant\u037e\n(7)\ncompared certain financial and stock market information of KCS and CPRL with similar information of other companies BofA Securities\ndeemed relevant\u037e\n(8)\ncompared certain financial terms of the transaction to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions BofA Securities\ndeemed relevant\u037e\n(9)\nreviewed the draft agreement, the debt commitment letters, the STB May 6 decision, the form of the voting trust agreement, and certain\nrelated documents\u037e and\n86\nTable of Contents\n(10)\nperformed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Securities deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and\nother information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with BofA Securities and has relied upon the\nassurances of the managements of KCS and CPRL that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data\ninaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the KCS management unaudited KCS projections, BofA Securities was advised by KCS,\nand assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management\nof KCS as to the future financial performance of KCS. With respect to the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections and the KCS management\nassumed synergies, in each case, BofA Securities was advised by KCS, and assumed, with the consent of KCS, that they were reasonably prepared on\nbases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of KCS as to the future financial performance of CPRL\nand other matters covered thereby. BofA Securities also relied, at the direction of KCS, on the assessments of the managements of KCS and CPRL,\nrespectively, as to CPRL\u2019s ability to achieve the KCS management assumed synergies and was advised by KCS and CPRL, and assumed, with the consent\nof KCS, that the KCS management assumed synergies would be realized in the amounts and at the times projected. BofA Securities did not make and was\nnot provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of KCS or CPRL, nor did BofA Securities\nmake any physical inspection of the properties or assets of KCS or CPRL. BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of KCS or CPRL\nunder any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of KCS, that the\ntransaction would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any\nmaterial term, condition or other agreement contemplated therein or thereby and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory\nand other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture\nrequirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on KCS, CPRL or the contemplated benefits of the\ntransaction. BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of KCS, that (i) the transaction would qualify for federal income tax purposes as a\nreorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) CPRL would obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the\ncommitment letters, (iii) the STB would permit the transaction to close into the voting trust in accordance with the terms of the STB May 6 decision and\nthe voting trust agreement and (iv) the final executed merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft agreement reviewed by\nBofA Securities.\nBofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the transaction (other than the merger consideration to the extent\nexpressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the transaction. BofA Securities\u2019 opinion was limited to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of KCS common stock (other than excluded\nshares) in the transaction and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any consideration to be received by the holders of KCS preferred stock\nor any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness\n(financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the\ntransaction, or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the\ntransaction in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to KCS or in which KCS might engage or as to the underlying\nbusiness decision of KCS to proceed with or effect the transaction. BofA Securities did not express any opinion as to what the value of CPRL common\nshares actually would be when issued or the prices at which KCS common stock or CPRL common shares would trade at any time, including following the\nannouncement or consummation of the transaction.

While the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual\nvolatility, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on KCS, CPRL or the transaction. It should be\nunderstood that subsequent developments may affect BofA Securities\u2019 opinion, and BofA Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise, or\nreaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities.\nThe discussion set forth below in the subsections entitled \u201c\u2014Summary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS,\u201d \u201c\u2014Summary of Material Financial\nAnalyses of CPRL,\u201d and \u201c\u2014Summary of Material Pro Forma Financial Analysis,\u201d beginning on pages 87, 91, and 93, respectively, represents a brief\nsummary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the KCS board in connection with its opinion.

Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial\nanalyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses\nperformed by BofA Securities.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.\nBofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information of the following five selected publicly traded companies in the rail\ntransportation industry:\n\u2022\nUnion Pacific Corporation\n\u2022\nCN\n\u2022\nCSX Corporation\n\u2022\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n\u2022\nCPRL\nBofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the closing price per share as of September 13, 2021 for Union Pacific Corporation, CSX Corporation and\nNorfolk Southern, as of April 19, 2021 for CN (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the CN proposal) and as of March 19, 2021 for\nCPRL (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement), as a multiple of Wall Street analyst\nconsensus estimates of calendar year 2022 earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) for the applicable company (such multiples are referred to in this section as \u201c2022E\nPrice/EPS\u201d). BofA Securities also reviewed the estimated enterprise value, calculated as the market value of equity plus short-term debt, long-term debt,\npreferred equity and non-controlling interest, minus cash, marketable securities and investments, as applicable (\u201cEV\u201d) for each selected company, as a\nmultiple of Wall Street analyst consensus estimates of calendar year 2022 EBITDA (such multiples are referred to in this section as \u201c2022E EV/EBITDA\u201d).\nFinancial data of the selected companies were derived from their public filings and publicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019 estimates published\nby FactSet as of September 13, 2021.\n88\nTable of Contents\nThe results of BofA Securities\u2019 analysis were presented for the selected publicly traded companies, as indicated in the following table:\nPrice/EPS\nEV/EBITDA\nCompany\n2022E\n2022E\nUnion Pacific Corporation\n18.3x\n12.8x\nCN\n22.6x\n14.5x\nCSX Corporation\n18.2x\n11.7x\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n18.5x\n12.4x\nCPRL\n21.2x\n14.7x\nThe overall low to high 2022E Price/EPS multiples observed for the selected companies were 18.2x to 22.6x (with a mean of 19.8x and median of 18.5x).\nBased on BofA Securities\u2019 review of the 2022E Price/EPS multiples for the selected companies and on its professional judgment and experience, BofA\nSecurities applied a 2022E Price/EPS multiple reference range of 18.5x to 22.0x to KCS management\u2019s estimated calendar year 2022 EPS as reflected in the\nKCS management unaudited KCS projections to calculate an implied equity value reference range per share of KCS common stock (rounded to the\nnearest $0.05). The selected multiple range of 18.5x to 22.0x was based on BofA Securities\u2019 professional judgment and experience as well as the observable\nrange of the selected publicly traded companies.\nThe overall low to high 2022E EV/EBITDA multiples observed for the selected companies were 11.7x to 14.7x (with a mean of 13.2x and median of 12.8x).\nBased on BofA Securities\u2019 review of the 2022E EV/EBITDA multiples for the selected companies and on its professional judgment and experience, BofA\nSecurities applied a 2022E EV/EBITDA multiple reference range of 12.0x to 15.0x to KCS management\u2019s estimated calendar year 2022 EBITDA as reflected\nin the KCS management unaudited KCS projections to calculate an implied equity value reference range per share of KCS common stock (rounded to the\nnearest $0.05). The selected multiple range of 12.0x to 15.0x was based on BofA Securities\u2019 professional judgment and experience as well as the observable\nrange of the selected publicly traded companies.\nThis analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value reference ranges per share of KCS common stock, as compared to the implied\nvalue of the merger consideration, calculated by adding the $90.00 in cash consideration to $198, the implied value of the 2.884 CPRL common shares\nincluded in the merger consideration based on the $68.55 closing price of CPRL common shares on September 13, 2021 (\u201cimplied consideration value\u201d):\nImplied Equity\nValue\nReference\nRange Per\nShare of KCS\nCommon\nStock\nImplied\nConsideration\nValue\n2022E Price/EPS\n$\n198.90 -\n$236.55\n$\n288\n2022E EV/EBITDA\n$\n198.60 \u2013\n$258.40\nNo selected publicly traded company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to KCS.

Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperating characteristics (reflected, among other things, in differences in historical trading levels of these companies) and other factors that could affect\nthe public trading or other values of the companies to which KCS was compared.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis.\nBofA Securities reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to 21 selected transactions involving acquisitions of rail\ntransportation companies since 1994. For each of these transactions, BofA Securities reviewed the merger values for each transaction based on the\nmerger consideration paid to the\n89\nTable of Contents\nshareholders of the target company in the selected transactions (with the full transaction value implied for transactions with less than 100% being\nacquired), as multiples of estimates of the target company\u2019s EBITDA, for the last twelve months for the year in which the applicable transaction was\nannounced except with respect to the Glencore Rail/Genesee & Wyoming Australia and the Genesee & Wyoming Australia/Macquarie Infrastructure &\nReal Assets transactions, where, in each case, such multiple was based on the estimated EBITDA for the twelve months following the announcement\nmade in October 2016, and based on publicly available information at that time (such multiples are referred to in this section as \u201cTV/LTM EBITDA\u201d).\nDate\nAnnounced\nTarget\nAcquiror\nTV\n/LTM\nEBITDA\nTransaction\nValue (1)\n07/19\nGenesee & Wyoming Inc.\nBrookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. / GIC Pte.

BofA Securities then calculated an implied equity value reference range per share of\nKCS common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.05). The selected multiple range of 11.5x to 14.0x was based on BofA Securities\u2019 professional judgment and\nexperience as well as the observable implied transaction multiples. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value reference\nranges per share of KCS common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied consideration value:\nImplied Equity Value Reference\nRange Per Share of KCS\nCommon Stock\nImplied\nConsideration\nValue\n$160.10 - $203.75\n$\n288\nNo selected precedent transaction used in this analysis or the applicable business or target company is identical or directly comparable to KCS or the\ntransaction. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations\nand judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics, market conditions and other factors that could affect the acquisition or\nother values of the companies or transactions to which KCS and the transaction were compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nBofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of KCS to calculate a range of implied present values per share of KCS common stock utilizing\nestimates of the standalone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that KCS was expected to generate during the six-month period ending December 31, 2021\nand for the fiscal years 2022 through 2029 based on the KCS management unaudited KCS projections. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for KCS\nby applying a selected range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.25% to 2.75% to KCS\u2019s normalized free cash flows in the terminal year. BofA Securities then\ncalculated implied equity value reference ranges per share of KCS common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.05) by deducting from this range of present\nvalues KCS\u2019s net debt, preferred equity and non-controlling interest as of June 30, 2021, as reflected in KCS\u2019s public filings, at the direction of KCS\nmanagement, and dividing the result by the number of fully-diluted shares of KCS common stock outstanding (calculated on a treasury stock method\nbasis, based on information provided by the management of KCS). The cash flows were discounted to present value as of June 30, 2021, utilizing mid-year\ndiscounting convention, and using a discount rate range of 6.0% to 7.5%, which was based on an estimate of KCS\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. A\ngrowth rate range of 2.25% to 2.75% was based on BofA Securities\u2019 professional judgment and experience and represents long-term growth outlook for\nthe business. The discount rate range reflected KCS\u2019s estimated weighted average cost of capital, which was calculated by multiplying the estimated cost\nof each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight, and then adding the products together. The estimated cost of equity was obtained using\nthe capital asset pricing model (which takes into account the risk-free rate, the levered beta and the applicable equity market risk premium) and the\nestimated cost of debt was based on KCS\u2019s estimated borrowing cost. KCS\u2019s net debt as of June 30, 2021 was based on KCS\u2019s Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended June 30, 2021, which reported debt of $3,780 million and cash of $326 million. The calculation for fully diluted shares was based on approximately 91\nmillion common shares outstanding as provided by KCS management and other dilutive shares such as options, performance shares and deferred shares.\nPreferred equity of $5 million and non-controlling interest of $327 million were based on the balance sheet provided in KCS\u2019s Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended June 30, 2021. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value reference range per share of KCS common stock (rounded to\nthe nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied consideration value:\nImplied Equity Value Reference\nRange Per Share of KCS\nCommon Stock\nImplied\nConsideration\nValue\n$206.00 - $351.95\n$\n288\n91\nTable of Contents\nOther Factors\nBofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities\u2019 financial analyses with respect to its opinion but\nwere referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things the following:\n\u2022\n52-Week Trading Range. BofA Securities reviewed the trading range of the shares of KCS common stock for the 52-week period ended\nMarch 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement), which was\n$100.54 to $224.16.\n\u2022\nWall Street Analysts Price Targets. BofA Securities reviewed 20 publicly available equity research analyst price targets for the shares of\nKCS common stock available as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior\nCP merger agreement), and noted that the range of such price targets (discounted by one year at KCS\u2019s estimated mid-point cost of equity\nof 7.7% and rounded to the nearest $0.05) was $185.70 to $238.65. The 7.7% discount rate applied by BofA reflected KCS\u2019s estimated mid-\npoint cost of equity, which was selected based on KCS\u2019s observable cost of equity.\n\u2022\nPresent Value of Future Stock Price. BofA Securities calculated a range of present values of KCS future stock prices discounted back to\nJune 30, 2021 by using KCS\u2019 estimated calendar year 2029 EPS based on the KCS management unaudited KCS projections, a range of price\nto next twelve months EPS multiples of 16.0x to 22.0x and KCS\u2019s estimated mid-point cost of equity of 7.7%, as well as the expected future\ndividend payments as provided by KCS management, which indicated a range of implied present values of future stock prices of KCS\ncommon stock of $247.85 per share to $334.55 per share, in each case rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share. Multiples used were based on\nBofA Securities\u2019 professional judgment and experience as well as observable historical trading data of KCS and selected publicly traded\ncompanies. The discount rate (cost of equity) used was based on KCS\u2019s observable cost of equity.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses of CPRL\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.\nBofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information of the following five selected publicly traded companies in the rail\ntransportation industry:\n\u2022\nUnion Pacific Corporation\n\u2022\nCSX Corporation\n\u2022\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n\u2022\nCN\n\u2022\nKCS\nBofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the closing price per share as of September 13, 2021 for Union Pacific Corporation, CSX Corporation and\nNorfolk Southern, as of April 19, 2021 for CN (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the CN proposal) and as of March 19, 2021 for\nKCS (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement), as a multiple of Wall Street analyst\nconsensus estimates of calendar year 2022 \u201cEPS\u201d for the applicable company (such multiples are referred to in this section as \u201c2022E Price/EPS\u201d).

BofA Securities calculated\nterminal values for CPRL by applying a selected range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.25% to 2.75%\n93\nTable of Contents\nto CPRL\u2019s normalized free cash flows in the terminal year. BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges per share of CPRL\ncommon shares (rounded to the nearest $0.05) by deducting from this range of present values CPRL\u2019s net debt as of June 30, 2021, as provided by KCS\nmanagement, and adding net pension assets as of June 30, 2021, as reflected in CPRL\u2019s public filings, at the direction of KCS management, and dividing\nthe result by the number of fully-diluted shares of CPRL common shares outstanding (calculated on a treasury stock method basis, based on information\nprovided by the management of KCS). The cash flows were discounted to present value as of June 30, 2021, utilizing mid-year discounting convention,\nand using a discount rate range of 6.0% to 7.5%, which was based on an estimate of CPRL\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. A growth rate range of\n2.25% to 2.75% was based on BofA Securities\u2019 professional judgment and experience and represents long-term growth outlook for the business. The\ndiscount rate range reflects CPRL\u2019s estimated weighted average cost of capital, which was calculated by multiplying the estimated cost of each capital\nsource (debt and equity) by its relevant weight, and then adding the products together. The estimated cost of equity was obtained using the capital asset\npricing model (which takes into account the risk-free rate, the levered beta and the applicable equity market risk premium) and the estimated cost of debt\nwas based on CPRL\u2019s estimated borrowing cost. Net debt as of June 30, 2021 was based on the balance sheet provided in CPRL\u2019s Form 10-Q dated July\n29, 2021, which reported debt of $6,978 million and cash of $714 million. The calculation of fully diluted shares was based on 666.8 million common shares\noutstanding and other dilutive shares such as options and performance shares. Net pension assets as of June 30, 2021 were based on the balance sheet\nprovided in CPRL\u2019s Form 10-Q dated July 29, 2021, which reported $237 million.. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value\nreference range per share of CPRL common shares (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the closing price of the CPRL common shares on\nSeptember 13, 2021 of $68.55 and the closing price of the CPRL common shares on March 19, 2021(which was the last trading day prior to the\nannouncement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $75.70:\nImplied Equity Value Reference\nRange Per Share of CPRL\nCommon Shares (taking into account the share split)\n$67.25 - $111.50\nOther Factors\nBofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities\u2019 financial analyses with respect to its opinion but\nwere referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things the following:\n\u2022\n52-Week Trading Range. BofA Securities reviewed the trading range of the shares of CPRL common shares for the 52-week period ended\nMarch 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement), which was\n$36.27 to $76.75 (taking into account the share split).\n\u2022\nWall Street Analysts Price Targets. BofA Securities reviewed 26 publicly available equity research analyst price targets for the CPRL\ncommon shares available as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP\nmerger agreement), and noted that the range of such price targets (discounted by one year at CPRL\u2019s estimated mid-point cost of equity of\n7.3% and rounded to the nearest $0.05) was $63.90 to $75.50 (taking into account the share split). The 7.3% discount rate reflects CPRL\u2019s\nestimated mid-point cost of equity, which was selected based on CPRL\u2019s observable cost of equity.\nSummary of Material Pro Forma Financial Analysis\nHas/Gets Analysis\nBofA Securities performed a Has/Gets Analysis to calculate the theoretical change in value for holders of KCS common stock resulting from the\ntransaction based on a comparison of (i) the pro forma ownership by holders of KCS common stock of CPRL after giving effect to the transaction, and (ii)\nthe 100% ownership by holders of\n94\nTable of Contents\nKCS common stock of KCS common stock on a stand-alone basis. For KCS common stock on a stand-alone basis, BofA Securities used the reference\nrange obtained in its discounted cash flow analysis described above under \u201cSummary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS \u2013 Discounted Cash Flow\nAnalysis.\u201d BofA Securities then performed the same analysis by calculating the range of implied per share equity values allocable to holders of KCS\ncommon stock on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the transaction, by assuming approximately 28% pro forma ownership, based on the number of\nshares of CPRL common shares estimated to be issued to holders of KCS common stock in the transaction, utilizing the results of the standalone\ndiscounted cash flow analyses for KCS and CPRL described above under \u201cSummary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS \u2013 Discounted Cash Flow\nAnalysis\u201d and under \u201cSummary of Material Financial Analyses of CPRL \u2013 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,\u201d and taking into account the KCS\nmanagement assumed synergies on the basis of (i) a projected $990 million in EBITDA synergies as provided by KCS management (referred to in this\nsection as the \u201c$990 million synergy case\u201d), which also included $20 million of projected D&A and Capex synergies, for total projected gross synergies of\n$1,010 million, and (ii) a projected $377 million in EBITDA synergies as provided by KCS management (referred to in this section as the \u201c$377 million\nsynergy case\u201d), which also included $23 million of projected D&A and Capex synergies for total projected gross synergies of $400 million. BofA\nSecurities calculated the present value of the synergies (including after-tax costs to achieve such synergies) as of June 30, 2021 by using a discount rate\nrange of 6.0% to 7.5%. The discount rate range of 6.0% to 7.5% was based on BofA Securities\u2019 professional judgment and experience and obtained using\nthe capital asset pricing model for the estimated cost of equity (which takes into account the risk-free rate, the levered beta and the applicable equity\nmarket risk premium) and the estimated cost of debt. Estimated additional net debt of $10.3 billion was based on announced transaction debt of $8.5\nbillion and estimated transaction fees and expenses as well as inclusion of $1.4 billion in break fees and reimbursements. BofA Securities then compared\nthese implied per share equity value reference ranges, which were further adjusted by an estimated additional net debt from the transaction and $90.00 per\nshare cash consideration, to the implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for KCS on a standalone basis utilizing the results of the\nstandalone discounted cash flow analysis for KCS described above.\nThis analysis yielded the following implied per share equity value reference ranges for KCS common stock on a stand-alone basis and on a pro forma\nbasis (rounded to the nearest $1.00):\nRange Per Share of KCS common stock\nImplied Equity Value Reference\nStand-Alone\nPro-\nForma\n$990\nMillion\nSynergy\nCase\nPro-\nForma\n$377\nMillion\nSynergy\nCase\n$206 - $352\n$290 -\n$444\n$268 -\n$409\nMiscellaneous\nAs noted above, the discussion set forth above in \u201cSummary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS,\u201d \u201cSummary of Material Financial Analyses of\nCPRL\u201d and \u201cSummary of Material Pro Forma Financial Analysis\u201d represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA\nSecurities to the KCS board in connection with its opinion, and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or factors considered by\nBofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as\nto the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a\nfinancial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses summarized above must\nbe considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information\npresented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the\nsummary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of\nwhich are beyond the control of KCS and CPRL. The estimates of the\n95\nTable of Contents\nfuture performance of KCS and CPRL in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were prepared\nsolely as part of BofA Securities\u2019 analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of KCS common stock of the merger consideration,\nto be received by such holders in the transaction and were provided to the KCS board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The\nanalyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or acquired or the prices at which any\nsecurities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any\nparticular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities\u2019 view of the actual\nvalues of KCS or CPRL.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the transaction was determined through negotiations between KCS and CPRL, rather than by any\nfinancial advisor, and was approved by the KCS board. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the KCS board. As described\nabove, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the KCS board in its evaluation of the transaction and should\nnot be viewed as determinative of the views of the KCS board or management or any other party with respect to the transaction or the merger\nconsideration.\nKCS has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the transaction an aggregate fee, which is currently estimated, based on the\ninformation available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $63 million, $5 million of which was paid to BofA Securities upon delivery of its\nopinion in connection with the execution of the prior CP merger agreement announced in March 2021, $2.5 million of which was paid upon delivery of\nBofA Securities\u2019 opinion in connection with the alternate proposed transaction involving CN announced in May 2021, $2.5 million of which is payable\nupon the rendering of its opinion in connection with the transaction and the remainder of which is payable upon the closing of the transaction. KCS also\nhas agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any\nof its affiliates, its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents and each other person controlling BofA Securities or any of its affiliates,\nagainst certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of BofA Securities\u2019 engagement.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives trading,\nforeign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and\ninvestment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,\ngovernments and individuals. In the ordinary course of BofA Securities\u2019 businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or\non behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in\nequity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of KCS, CPRL and certain of their\nrespective affiliates.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial\nbanking and other financial services to KCS and its affiliates and have received, or in the future may receive, compensation for the rendering of these\nservices, including (i) having acted as a joint bookrunner on certain debt capital markets transactions for KCS, (ii) having acted as a dealer-manager on an\naccelerated share repurchase transaction for KCS and (iii) having acted or acting as administrative agent, co-lead arranger and joint bookrunner for, and\nas a lender (including a letter of credit lender) under, KCS\u2019s $600 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility due March 8, 2024. From September 1,\n2019, through August 31, 2021, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from KCS and its affiliates of approximately $10.4 million for\ncorporate and/or investment banking services, which includes the fee received upon delivery of its opinion in connection with the CN proposal.\nIn addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking,\ncommercial banking and other financial services to CPRL and its affiliates and\n96\nTable of Contents\nhave received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted as a bookrunning manager and/or\nco-manager on certain debt capital markets transactions for CPRL, (ii) having acted or acting as a lender under CPRL\u2019s $1.3 billion revolving credit facility,\nwhich consists of a $1.0 billion tranche and a $300 million tranche, which was amended on September 24, 2021 to extend the maturity dates of such\ntranches to September 27, 2026 and September 27, 2023, respectively, and (iii) having provided or providing certain treasury services and products to\nCPRL. From September 1, 2019, through August 31, 2021, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from CPRL of approximately $6.6\nmillion for corporate and/or investment banking services. In addition, BofA Securities received a customary fee of less than $100,000 in connection with\nits commitment to act as a lender under CPRL\u2019s amended revolving credit facility, which was received subsequent to such period.\nKCS Unaudited Prospective Financial Information",

            "text": "Summary of KCS Prospective Financial Information\nKCS Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nAs described under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Background of the Transaction,\u201d on page 49,\nKCS management maintains the KCS long-range plan, which is periodically updated and reviewed with the KCS board, that reflects KCS management\u2019s\nfinancial and business outlook for KCS over a ten-year period. This KCS long-range plan was reviewed by the KCS board in connection with its\nconsideration of a transaction with CPRL, CN and other potential strategic alternatives throughout the latter half of 2020 continuing through its meeting\non September 15, 2021. The KCS long-range plan included certain unaudited prospective financial information concerning KCS on a standalone basis for\nthe fiscal years ending December 31, 2021 through December 31, 2029. We refer to these unaudited projections as the \u201cKCS management unaudited KCS\nprojections\u201d. The KCS management unaudited KCS projections were provided to Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities, which were directed by KCS\nmanagement to use and rely upon the KCS management unaudited KCS projections for purposes of their respective financial analyses and fairness\nopinions. In addition, certain of the KCS management unaudited KCS projections were provided to CPRL, the CPRL board and their respective financial\nadvisors, BMO, Goldman Sachs and Evercore.\nIn connection with the transaction, KCS management also prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information concerning CPRL on a standalone\nbasis using (i) the CPRL five-year plan (as prepared by CPRL management and provided to KCS management) and (ii) extrapolations prepared by KCS\nmanagement on the basis of the CPRL five-year plan for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2026 through December 31, 2029. Such unaudited\nprospective financial information was translated into U.S. dollar amounts from the original Canadian dollar amounts presented in the CPRL five-year plan\nbased on an assumed foreign exchange ratio of 1.25x. We refer to these unaudited projections as the \u201cKCS management unaudited CPRL projections,\u201d\nand the KCS management unaudited KCS projections and the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections, collectively, as the \u201cKCS management\nunaudited projections\u201d. The KCS management unaudited CPRL\n97Table of Contents\nprojections were provided to the KCS board in connection with its consideration of the transaction as well as to Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities,\nwhich were directed by KCS management to use and rely upon the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections for purposes of their respective\nfinancial analyses and fairness opinions.\nThe KCS management unaudited projections were prepared treating KCS and CPRL, respectively, on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the\ntransaction, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the transaction, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with the transaction\nor the consummation thereof, the potential synergies that may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the transaction, the effect of any\nbusiness or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed or in anticipation of the\ntransaction, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been\nexecuted but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the transaction.\nIn connection with the transaction, KCS management prepared pro forma analyses, which were presented to the KCS board, that included CPRL\u2019s\nestimated potential earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which we refer to as \u201cEBITDA\u201d) synergies of $990 million (consisting of\n$810 million from revenue synergies and $180 million from operating and expense synergies), together with an alternative case showing a lower estimate\nof potential EBITDA synergies of $377 million (consisting of $222 million from revenue synergies and $155 million from operating and expense synergies).\nThe primary difference between the two cases was a more conservative assumption on revenue synergies (specifically the combined company\u2019s share of\nbulk commodities) in the $377 million EBITDA synergies case. The assumptions used in the $990 million EBITDA synergies case were based on CPRL\u2019s\nassessment of market opportunities that the combined company could reasonably be expected to capture, leading to a substantially greater estimate of\nrevenue synergies. KCS management believed, however, that for purposes of the KCS board\u2019s consideration of the transaction, the KCS board should\nalso consider a synergies estimate reflecting the more conservative assumptions. The $377 million EBITDA synergies case also used slightly more\nconservative assumptions with respect to operating and expense synergies. The pro forma analyses, in each case, assumed a phase-in of synergies over\nthe three years following CPRL\u2019s receipt of STB final approval, beginning in fiscal year 2023. KCS management, among other things, assumed that the\naggregate cost of achieving the projected synergies would be, with respect to the $990 million synergies case, $180 million, and with respect to the $377\nmillion synergies case, $155 million, with half of the costs to be incurred in the first year of the phase-in and the remaining half to be incurred in the\nsecond year of the phase-in. KCS management also assumed, with respect to the $990 million synergies case, no dissynergies, $20 million of capital\nexpenditure and depreciation and amortization synergies and a one-time capital investment of $50 million, and, with respect to the $377 million synergies\ncase, $50 million of dissynergies and $23 million of capital expenditure and depreciation and amortization synergies. These assumed dissynergies or\nadditional synergies were subtracted from or added to the EBITDA synergies estimates. The assumed EBITDA synergies, including the cost to achieve\nsuch synergies, included in the two cases (which we refer to collectively as the \u201cKCS management assumed synergies\u201d) are not reflected in the KCS\nmanagement unaudited projections. The KCS management assumed synergies were provided to Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities, which were\ndirected by KCS management to use and rely upon the KCS management assumed synergies for purposes of their respective financial analyses and\nfairness opinions.\nOther than annual financial guidance provided to investors, which is generally updated each quarter, KCS does not as a matter of course make public\nlong-term forecasts or projections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other results, due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of\naccurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the financial\nprojections by KCS management are being included in this proxy statement/prospectus to give shareholders access to certain non-public information\nprovided to the KCS board and KCS\u2019s financial advisors and to CPRL and the CPRL board and their respective financial advisors. The inclusion of the\nfinancial projections by KCS should not be regarded as an indication that the KCS board, KCS, the CPRL board, CPRL, Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities,\nBMO, Goldman Sachs or Evercore or any other recipient of this information\n98\nTable of Contents\nconsidered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not\nbe relied on as such.\nThis prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines\nestablished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information, or GAAP, but,\nin the view of KCS\u2019s management were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation,\nand presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of KCS\u2019s management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected\nfuture financial performance of KCS or CPRL, as applicable. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily\nindicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the KCS management unaudited\nprojections or the KCS management assumed synergies. Although KCS\u2019s management believes there is a reasonable basis for the KCS management\nunaudited projections and the KCS management assumed synergies, KCS cautions stockholders that future results could be materially different from the\nKCS management unaudited projections and the KCS management assumed synergies. This summary of the KCS management unaudited projections and\nthe KCS management assumed synergies is included in this proxy statement/prospectus because the KCS management unaudited projections and the\nKCS management assumed synergies were provided to KCS\u2019s financial advisors and to the KCS board for purposes of considering and evaluating the\ntransaction and the merger agreement.\nOther than annual financial guidance provided to investors, CPRL does not as a matter of course share with third parties long-term forecasts or\nprojections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficult of accurately predicting\nfinancial performance for future periods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. CPRL\u2019s management prepared and provided to\nKCS\u2019s management the CPRL five-year plan solely in connection with KCS\u2019s consideration of a transaction with CPRL. The fact that the CPRL five-year\nplan was provided to KCS management should not be regarded as an indication that the CPRL board, CPRL, KCS or any other recipient of the CPRL five-\nyear plan considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results of CPRL, and\nit should not be relied on as such.\nThe KCS management unaudited projections and the KCS management assumed synergies are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects\nand, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented with numerical specificity, the KCS management unaudited projections and the KCS\nmanagement assumed synergies are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by\nKCS\u2019s management as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons, including\ngeneral economic conditions, industry trends, the regulatory environment, competition, and the risks discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus under\nthe sections entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on pages 36 and 21, respectively.\nSee also \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information\u201d beginning on page 229. The KCS management unaudited projections and the KCS management\nassumed synergies also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Because the KCS management unaudited\nprojections were developed for KCS on a standalone basis without giving effect to the transaction, they do not reflect any divestitures or other\nrestrictions that may be imposed in connection with the receipt of any necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, any synergies that may be\nrealized as a result of the transaction or any changes to KCS\u2019s or CPRL\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after completion of the\ntransaction. There can be no assurance that the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed synergies will be realized, and\nactual results may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the KCS management unaudited projections and the\nKCS management assumed synergies relate, the less predictable and more unreliable the information becomes.\nThe KCS management unaudited projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that KCS believes are helpful in understanding its past\nfinancial performance and future results. KCS management regularly uses a\n99\nTable of Contents\nvariety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring financial performance. The non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While KCS believes that these non-\nGAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze KCS\u2019s financial and business\ntrends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of KCS\u2019s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures of KCS\u2019s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation.\nFinancial measures included in projections provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business combination transaction\nare excluded from the definition of \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d under the rules of the SEC, and therefore such financial measures are not subject to\nSEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which may otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a\nGAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to and were not relied on by Morgan Stanley or BofA\nSecurities for purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions or by the KCS board in connection with its consideration of the transaction,\nnor were they provided to CPRL or its financial advisors. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures has not been provided.\nNone of KCS, CPRL, the combined company or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives can provide any assurance\nthat actual results will not differ from the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed synergies, and none of them\nundertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed\nsynergies to reflect circumstances existing after the date the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed synergies were\nprepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the KCS management unaudited\nprojections or the KCS management assumed synergies, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable securities laws, KCS\ndoes not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed\nsynergies, even in the event that any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. None of KCS or its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other\nrepresentatives has made or makes any representation to any KCS stockholder or other person regarding KCS\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the\ninformation contained in the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed synergies or that forecasted results will be\nachieved. KCS has made no representation to CPRL, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the KCS management unaudited projections or the\nachieved. KCS has made no representation to CPRL, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the KCS management unaudited projections or the\nKCS management assumed synergies.\nThe prospective financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, KCS management.

The KCS board was aware of these interests and\nconsidered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the\nmerger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and in recommending to KCS stockholders that the merger agreement be\nadopted. KCS stockholders should take the interests described below into account in deciding whether to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the KCS merger proposal. Note\nthat the transaction will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of the KCS compensation arrangements described below. For purposes of this\nsection, a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d generally means (i) a termination by CPRL, KCS or any of their respective subsidiaries without \u201ccause\u201d or (ii) a\ntermination of employment with \u201cgood reason,\u201d in each case occurring during the period that begins on the effective time and ends on the second\nanniversary of the control date.\nFor purposes of this disclosure, the named executive officers of KCS are as follows:\nName of Executive Officer\nPosition\nPatrick J.

Erdman, Executive Vice\nPresident, Administration and Corporate Affairs\u037e Oscar Augusto Del Cueto Cuevas, KCSM President, General Manager and Executive\u037e Representative\nLora S. Cheatum, Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer\u037e Suzanne M. Grafton, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer\u037e and Adam\nJ. Godderz, Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary.\nTreatment of KCS Equity Awards\nTreatment of KCS Stock Options. Each KCS Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time\nwill, at the effective time, become fully vested and be converted into the\n102Table of Contents\nright to receive an amount of cash equal to (i) the excess, if any of (A) the value of the merger consideration over (B) the per share exercise price of such\noption multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of KCS common stock subject to such option as of immediately prior to the effective time, less\napplicable tax withholding.\nTreatment of KCS Restricted Share Awards. Each KCS restricted share award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time and was\ngranted prior to March 21, 2021, will, at the effective time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive (i) the merger consideration in\nrespect of each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award as of immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) the accrued\nbut unpaid cash dividends corresponding to each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award, less applicable tax\nwithholding.\nEach KCS restricted share award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time and was granted on or after March 21, 2021, will, at the\neffective time, be converted into an award that entitles the holder thereof, upon vesting, to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to the value of the merger\nconsideration in respect of each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award and (ii) the accrued but unpaid cash dividends\ncorresponding to each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award. Each such cash- based award will have the same terms\nand conditions (including vesting terms and conditions) as applied to the corresponding KCS restricted share award, except that such award will vest in\nfull upon a qualifying termination.\nTreatment of KCS Performance Share Awards. Each award of performance shares that corresponds to shares of KCS common stock (which we refer to as\na \u201cKCS performance share award\u201d) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be converted into an award\nthat entitles the holder thereof, upon vesting, to receive an amount in cash equal to the value of the merger consideration multiplied by 200% of the target\nnumber of shares of KCS common stock covered by the KCS performance share award as of immediately prior to the effective time. Each cash-based\naward will have the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms and conditions) as applied to the corresponding KCS performance share award,\nexcept that performance-based vesting conditions will no longer apply and the award will vest in full upon a qualifying termination.\nTreatment of Director Deferred Stock Awards. Each share of director deferred stock of KCS that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective\ntime, will, at the effective time, be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, less applicable tax withholding.\nFor an estimate of the value of unvested equity awards that would vest assuming that the transaction closes on December 31, 2021 and each of the\nnamed executive officers experiences a qualifying termination on that date, see \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to KCS\u2019s Named\nExecutive Officers in Connection with the Transaction\u201d below on page 105. The estimated aggregate value of unvested and outstanding equity awards\nand any corresponding accrued but unpaid cash dividends held by all six KCS executive officers, other than the KCS named executive officers, that\nwould vest assuming that the transaction closes on December 31, 2021 and all such executive officers experience qualifying terminations on that date is\n$16,646,120 (in the aggregate). Additionally, upon the completion of the merger, non-employee directors of KCS will receive amounts previously earned in\nconnection with their service on the board of directors of KCS that were deferred in the form of KCS director deferred stock awards.\nExecutive Severance Arrangements\nEach of KCS\u2019s executive officers is party to a severance agreement with KCS. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,\non September 15, 2021, KCS entered into letter agreements with seven of KCS\u2019s executive officers, including each of KCS\u2019s named executive officers other\nthan Mr. Hancock. The letter agreements: (1) provide that the protection period for enhanced change in control severance (the \u201cprotection period\u201d) will\nrun from the date the transaction is completed through the two-year anniversary of the control date\u037e (2) clarify that, for purposes of determining an\nexecutive officer\u2019s pro-rata bonus\n103\nTable of Contents\nand target bonus portion of cash severance, the \u201ctarget award\u201d will be the greater of the target award for the calendar year in which the executive officer\u2019s\nemployment is terminated and the target award for the calendar year in which the change in control occurs and (3) for Mr. Upchurch and two executive\nofficers who are not named executive officers, establish the multiple applicable to the base salary and target bonus components of his or her severance\nduring the protection period at three times in exchange for waiving certain rights these officers had under their severance agreement in connection with\nthe change in control resulting from the transaction.\nIn addition, in consideration of (1) certain acknowledgments from the applicable executive officers that the completion of the transaction will not, in and\nof itself, constitute \u201cgood reason\u201d under the executive officers\u2019 severance arrangements and (2) the extension by one year of the post-termination non-\ncompetition period for each of the executive officers other than Mr. Songer, the letter agreements provide that, in the event that an executive officer\nreceives any payments or benefits that are subject to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the executive officer will receive a payment that puts the\nexecutive officer in the same after-tax position as though such tax did not apply.\nOne executive officer who is not a named executive officer is party to an employment agreement with KCS that was in effect prior to entry into the merger\nagreement and already provided for a make-whole payment and severance benefits as described below.\nOne executive officer who is not a named executive officer and was not previously party to a severance agreement, entered into an employment\nagreement with KCS providing for severance payments and benefits consistent with those provided to the other executive officers, as described in the\nparagraph below, as well as a make-whole payment on the same terms and conditions described above.\nOne executive officer who is not a named executive officer is entitled to receive 90 days of salary, plus an additional 20 days of salary for each year of\nservice upon a qualifying termination, as well as other statutory benefits in connection with the executive officer\u2019s service, pursuant to Mexican law.\nUpon a qualifying termination, each executive officer, other than the executive officer described in the immediately preceding paragraph, will be entitled to\nreceive:\n(i) cash severance equal to:\n(A) three times the sum of the executive officer\u2019s base salary and target bonus, in the case of Messrs. Ottensmeyer, Upchurch and two\nexecutive officers who are not named executive officers\u037e\n(B) two times the sum of the executive officer\u2019s base salary and target bonus, in the case of Messrs. Songer, Naatz and one executive officer\nwho is not a named executive officer\u037e and\n(C) 320% of base salary for two executive officers who are not named executive officers,\n(ii) for all executive officers, other than two executive officers who are not named executive officers, the executive officer\u2019s target bonus for the\nfiscal year in which the termination occurs, prorated for the number of days in the calendar year prior to the executive officer\u2019s termination of employment,\n(iii) for all executive officers, other than one executive officer who is not a named executive officer, monthly cash reimbursement payments for the\ndifference between the monthly COBRA premium paid by the executive officer and the monthly premium amount paid by similarly situated active\nexecutives of KCS for an 18-month period,\n(iv) for one executive officer, who is not a named executive officer, regardless of whether he incurs a qualifying termination, three years of\ncontinued participation in all of KCS\u2019s health, benefit, welfare, retirement and other similar plans, including employee stock ownership plans, and\n104\nTable of Contents\n(v) for all executives, other than two executive officers, who are not named executive officers, outplacement benefits for one year, with a maximum\nvalue of $25,000.\nThe severance amounts described in clause (i) above are payable in equal installments over 12 months.\nOther than in the case of one executive officer who is not a named executive officer, the severance benefits described above are subject to the executive\nofficer executing an arbitration agreement and signing a general release of employment-related claims in favor of KCS. In addition, the agreements include,\nfor each executive officer other than one executive officer who is not a named executive officer, a prohibition on competition for a period of two years\nfollowing the executive officer\u2019s termination of employment (one year for each of Messrs. Songer and Hancock and one executive officer who is not a\nnamed executive officer), and a perpetual non-disparagement obligation and employee and customer non-solicitation restrictions that apply for a period\nof two years following the executive officer\u2019s termination of employment (one year for each of Messrs. Songer and Hancock and one executive officer\nwho is not a named executive officer). All executive officers are also subject to a perpetual confidentiality obligation.\nThe estimated value of the make-whole payment for each named executive officer is set forth below in the table entitled \u201cGolden Parachute Compensation\nTable\u201d and, for purposes of this quantification, does not reflect the impact of any common approaches to mitigating potential tax exposure under Section\n4999 of the Code, such as ascribing value to post-closing non-competition covenants or otherwise treating amounts paid as reasonable compensation for\nservices rendered following the closing. Based on the same assumptions set forth in the subsection below entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential\nPayments and Benefits to KCS\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction\u201d and in footnote 4 to the \u201cGolden Parachute\nCompensation Table,\u201d the estimated aggregate make-whole payments for all of KCS\u2019s executive officers who are not named executive officers would be\n$8,121,350, which value is a conservative estimate and does not reflect the impact of any common approaches to mitigating potential tax exposure under\nSection 4999 of the Code, such as ascribing value to post-closing non-competition covenants or otherwise treating amounts paid as reasonable\ncompensation for services rendered following the closing.\nThe estimated value of the severance payments and benefits for each of the named executive officers is set forth below in the table entitled \u201cGolden\nParachute Compensation Table.\u201d Based on the same assumptions set forth in the subsection below entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and\nBenefits to KCS\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction\u201d and in footnote 1 to the \u201cGolden Parachute Compensation Table,\u201d the\nestimated aggregate cash severance payment for all of KCS\u2019s executive officers who are not named executive officers, is $10,417,300, of which the portion\napplicable to the non-U.S. executive officer was converted from pesos to USD based on the September 27, 2021 exchange rate published by the Bank of\nMexico.\nRetention Program\nKCS has established a cash-based retention program for KCS employees that is designed to promote retention, incentivize the completion of the\ntransaction and reward extraordinary effort. Each award granted pursuant to the retention program will vest and become payable in two installments: (1)\n25% on the earlier of (a) the closing date and (b) February 21, 2022, and (2) 75% on the earlier of (a) ninety (90) days after the control date and (b) June 1,\n2023, subject, in each case, to the recipient\u2019s continued employment through the applicable vesting dates\u037e provided, however, that if the recipient\nexperiences a qualifying termination, then the recipient will be entitled to any then unpaid portion of the recipient\u2019s award. KCS has granted retention\nawards in the amount of $2,120,000\u037e $1,082,000\u037e $1,076,000 and $1,018,000 to each of Messrs. Ottensmeyer, Upchurch, Songer and Naatz, respectively.\nKCS has granted retention awards equal to $4,384,500 in the aggregate to the KCS executive officers who are not named executive officers.\nTreatment of 2021 and 2022 Bonuses\nKCS and CPRL have agreed that, with respect to the 2021 and 2022 annual bonuses for all employees, including the executive officers, if the control date\nhas not occurred prior to the date that such annual bonuses are payable,\n105\nTable of Contents\nKCS will be permitted to pay such bonuses at the greater of (i) target performance and (ii) 130% of actual performance, but in no event greater than 200%\nof target, and if the control date has occurred prior to the date that such annual bonuses are payable, then CPRL will pay such bonuses at the applicable\ngreater of amount.\nContinued Indemnification and Insurance\nFrom and after the effective time, CPRL and the second surviving corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each current and former director, officer or\nemployee of KCS and each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,\npension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of KCS or its subsidiaries, in each case determined as of the\neffective time, against any costs or expenses, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement\nincurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or\ninvestigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time,\nwhether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time.\nPrior to the effective time, KCS will obtain and fully pay for \u201ctail\u201d insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from and after the effective\ntime with respect to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent\nbenefits as KCS\u2019s existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time, subject to certain limitation and premium\nthresholds. For additional details regarding the indemnification and insurance described herein, see the discussion under the section entitled \u201cThe KCS\nMerger Proposal\u2014Indemnification and Insurance,\u201d on page 157.\nArrangements with CPRL\nAs of the date hereof, none of our executive officers has entered into any agreement with CPRL or any of its affiliates regarding employment with CPRL or\none or more of its affiliates following the consummation of the transaction. Prior to or following the control date certain of our executive officers may have\ndiscussions, or may enter into agreements with, CPRL or one of its affiliates regarding employment with CPRL or one or more of its affiliates.\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to KCS\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information\nabout certain compensation for each named executive officer KCS that is based on, or otherwise related to, the transaction. For additional details\nregarding the terms of the payments and benefits described herein, see the discussion under the subsection entitled \u201cInterests of KCS\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Transaction,\u201d on page 101. The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may\nnot actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect\ncertain compensation actions that may occur after the date hereof and before the transaction closes. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the\nfollowing assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe relevant price per share of KCS common stock is $273.70, which is the average closing price per share of KCS common stock as\nreported on the NYSE over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the transaction on September 15, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nThe transaction closes on December 31, 2021, which is the assumed closing date solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e\n\u2022\nEach named executive officer of KCS experiences a qualifying termination on the assumed closing date of December 31, 2021 and\nimmediately following the closing of the transaction\u037e\n106\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nEach named executive officer\u2019s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from those in effect as of September 27, 2021\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nEach named executive officer\u2019s unvested and outstanding equity awards are as of September 27, 2021 and no named executive officer\nreceives any additional equity grants on or prior to the completion of the transaction.\nFor purposes of this golden parachute disclosure, \u201csingle trigger\u201d refers to payments and benefits that arise as a result of the closing of the transaction\nand \u201cdouble trigger\u201d refers to payments and benefits that require two conditions, which are the closing of the transaction and a qualifying termination of\nemployment.\nGolden Parachute Compensation Table\nNamed Executive Officer\nCash ($)(1)\nEquity($)(2)\nBenefits($)(3)\nMake-Whole\nPayments($)(4)\nTotal ($)\nPatrick J.

The amounts listed in this column represent the estimated make-whole payment each named executive officer could\nbecome entitled to receive on a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d basis upon a qualifying termination of employment following the closing of the transaction (and,\nfor purposes of this quantification, does not contemplate any common approaches to mitigating potential tax exposure under Section 4999 of the\nCode, such as ascribing value to post-closing non-competition covenants or otherwise treating amounts paid as reasonable compensation for\nservices rendered following the closing). However, in the event that a named executive officer is subject to excise taxes under Section 4999 of the\nCode solely as a result of \u201csingle-trigger\u201d payments and benefits, that named executive officer would also be entitled to receive a make-whole\npayment, as applicable. In addition to the assumptions described immediately prior to the table above, the amounts in this column are calculated\nbased on a 20% excise tax rate and each named executive officer\u2019s estimated effective tax rate, including a federal marginal income tax rate of 37%\nand applicable federal, state, local and payroll taxes. The actual amount of the make whole-payment for each named executive officer, if any, will not\nbe determinable until after the closing of the transaction.

Despite\nthe fact that CPRL shareholders are being asked to approve the issuance of up to 277,960,197 CPRL common shares, based on the number of shares of\nKCS common stock outstanding as of September 9, 2021, CPRL expects that it would issue (at the direction of surviving merger sub and on behalf of\nsurviving merger sub) up to 264,723,997 CPRL common shares in the first merger and is seeking CPRL shareholder approval for the issuance of up to\n13,236,200 additional CPRL common shares to accommodate the effects of rounding and for other administrative purposes in accordance with the policies\nof the TSX.\nAt the close of business on October 29, 2021, there were approximately 91,057,137 shares of KCS common stock outstanding (including 186,658 shares of\nKCS common stock subject to outstanding KCS restricted share awards) and an aggregate of 10,102 shares of KCS common stock issuable in connection\nwith KCS director deferred stock. Additionally, up to an aggregate of 600,516 shares of KCS common stock are issuable under KCS options and KCS\nperformance share awards outstanding and exercisable prior to the effective time. On this basis, up to 262,637,917 CPRL common shares may be issued or\nreserved for issuance under the merger agreement as share consideration to holders of shares of KCS common stock and holders of KCS restricted share\nawards and KCS director deferred stock. Immediately following the first merger, former holders of KCS common stock are expected to own approximately\n28% of the outstanding CPRL common shares, on a fully diluted basis.\nThe actual number of CPRL common shares to be issued or reserved for issuance under the merger agreement will be determined immediately prior to the\neffective time based on the exchange ratio, the number of shares of KCS common stock outstanding at such time and the number of KCS restricted share\nawards and KCS director deferred stock outstanding at such time.\nCPRL will be holding the CPRL special meeting to vote on the resolutions necessary to complete the transaction and other matters to be considered by\nthe CPRL shareholders at such special meeting. In addition to the above-mentioned resolution approving the issuance of CPRL common shares to KCS\ncommon stockholders in connection with the transaction, at the CPRL special meeting, CPRL shareholders will be asked to approve a special resolution\nauthorizing and approving an amendment to CPRL\u2019s articles to change its name to \u201cCanadian Pacific Kansas City,\u201d which amendment is conditional upon\nthe occurrence of the control date.

There can be no assurance, however, if and when any of the consents required to be obtained for the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be obtained or as to the conditions or limitations that such approvals may contain or impose.\nAlthough CPRL and KCS believe that they will receive the required authorizations and approvals described below to complete the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, there can be no assurance as to the timing of these consents and approvals, CPRL\u2019s or KCS\u2019s ultimate ability to\nobtain such consents or approvals (or any additional consents or approvals that may otherwise become necessary), or the conditions or limitations that\nsuch approvals may contain or impose.\nFor more information see the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions that Must Be Satisfied or Waived\nfor the Transaction to Occur\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Filings and Efforts\u037e Other Actions,\u201d on pages 140 and 159, respectively.\nSTB\nCertain activities of CPRL, KCS and their subsidiaries are regulated by the STB. The provisions of subtitle IV, title 49 of the United States Code require\napproval of, or the granting of an exemption from approval by, the STB for (i) the acquisition of control of two or more carriers subject to the jurisdiction\nof the STB by a person that is not a carrier and (ii) the acquisition or control of a carrier by a person that is not a carrier but that controls any number of\ncarriers. STB approval or exemption is required for, among other things, CPRL\u2019s acquisition of control of KCS.\nThe parties intend to consummate the transaction prior to having obtained STB final approval for CPRL to control KCS, through the use of a voting trust.\nA voting trust is a mechanism that allows the transfer of beneficial ownership of the shares of a rail carrier to an acquiror, while keeping that rail carrier\nindependent and avoiding premature control of that rail carrier pending STB review of the proposed transaction. Accordingly, the outstanding shares of\ncapital stock of the second surviving corporation (as successor to KCS) would remain in the voting trust pending the STB\u2019s review of CPRL\u2019s acquisition\nof control of KCS. On May 6, 2021, the STB issued a decision indicating that it had conducted a full review of the voting trust submitted to the STB Staff\nin March 2021 and granted approval for the use of the voting trust to consummate the transaction, subject to the condition that the voting trust\nagreement be modified to prohibit the trustee from owning securities of CPRL or its affiliates during the existence of the voting trust. CPRL made the\nrequisite modification. The voting trust\n110Table of Contents\nagreement proposed for use with the transaction is unchanged from that modified in respect to the STB\u2019s May 6 decision.\nUnder the merger agreement, CPRL will, via the post-closing contributions, cause the contribution of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the\nsecond surviving corporation to merger holdco, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CPRL. CPRL and merger holdco intend, immediately after the\nclosing of the transaction and the post-closing contributions, to deposit the certificates for all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second\nsurviving corporation into the voting trust to ensure that CPRL and merger holdco do not acquire and directly or indirectly exercise control over KCS and\nits affiliates prior to obtaining necessary STB approval or exemption. Instead, the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation\nwould be held in trust and voted by the trustee.\nWith CPRL\u2019s and KCS\u2019s planned use of the voting trust arrangement, under the terms of the voting trust agreement approved by the STB on May 6, 2021,\nsubstantially in the form of Exhibit A of the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, the trustee would hold such\nshares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation (i) until the receipt of STB final approval, or (ii) if STB final approval is denied, until the trust\nstock is disposed of. The voting trust agreement provides that the trustee will vote all trust stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or\ndesirable to effect, or consistent with the effectuation of, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and, until the STB has issued a final\norder approving the transaction and common control of KCS by CPRL, against any proposed merger, business combination or similar transaction\ninvolving KCS but not involving CPRL or one of its affiliates. The voting trust agreement contains other terms and conditions designed to ensure that\nneither merger holdco nor CPRL will control KCS during the pendency of the STB proceedings. In addition, the voting trust agreement provides that\nCPRL or its affiliates will be entitled to receive any cash dividend paid by KCS.\nOn March 22, 2021, CPRL and KCS (collectively, the \u201capplicants\u201d) submitted a prefiling notification (the \u201cprefiling notification\u201d) to file the appropriate and\nnecessary documentation seeking STB final approval for CPRL to control KCS (which we refer to as the \u201cSTB approval application\u201d). The applicants also\nsubmitted a motion for protective order and petition to establish a procedural schedule to the STB. On the same day, the applicants sent to the STB Staff\na copy of the original proposed form of the voting trust agreement, which was attached to the prior CP merger agreement as Exhibit A, and sought an\ninformal opinion that the voting trust would comply with STB standards. On March 23, 2021, the applicants filed an errata to the prefiling notification and\nasked that the STB substitute a revised prefiling notification.\nIn the prefiling notification, the applicants noted that the proposed transaction was subject to the regulations set forth at 49 C.F.R. pt. 1180 (2000) rather\nthan the version of those regulations adopted in 2001 pursuant to the waiver for transactions involving KCSR described in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.0(b). 49 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1180.0(b) provides, in pertinent part, that the STB \u201cwill waive application of the regulations contained in this subpart for a consolidation involving\n[KCSR] and another Class 1 railroad and instead will apply the regulations in this subpart A in effect before July 11, 2001 . . . unless [the STB is] shown\nwhy such a waiver should not be allowed.\u201d\nOn April 23, 2021, the STB issued a decision finding that the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.0(b) applies to the transaction, and that the\ntransaction will therefore be subject to the regulations set forth at 49 C.F.R. part 1180 (2000) rather than the 2001 version of those rules.\nAs noted above, on May 6, 2021, the STB issued a decision indicating that it had conducted a full review of the voting trust agreement submitted to the\nSTB Staff in March 2021 and granted approval for the use of the voting trust to consummate the transaction, subject to the condition that the voting trust\nagreement be modified to prohibit the trustee from owning securities of CPRL or its affiliates during the existence of the voting trust. CPRL made the\nrequisite modification. The voting trust agreement proposed for use with the transaction is unchanged from that modified in response to the STB\u2019s May 6\ndecision.\n111\nTable of Contents\nOn September 15, 2021, CPRL and KCS filed with the STB an Amended Notice of Intent indicating that they had entered a new agreement providing for\nCPRL\u2019s acquisition of KCS, that they would file an application seeking STB control approval on or shortly after October 20, 2021, and that CPRL intended\nto indirectly acquire the shares of KCS prior to receiving control approval via the use of a voting trust that was substantially identical to that reviewed\nand approved by the STB in its May 6 decision.\nOn September 30, 2021, the STB issued a decision confirming that the transaction described in the September 15 Amended Notice of Intent was the \u201csame\ntransaction\u201d that had been noticed in March 2021 and that the STB\u2019s May 6, 2021 approval for CPRL\u2019s proposed use of a voting trust to acquire KCS\napplies to the voting trust proposed for use with the transaction agreed to on September 15.\nOn October 29, 2021, CPRL and KCS filed their application seeking STB final approval for CPRL to control KCS and its U.S. rail carrier subsidiaries.\nUnder the merger agreement, CPRL and KCS must use reasonable best efforts to prosecute all filings and other presentations made, and promptly make\nany subsequent filings or presentations, with the STB with diligence, diligently oppose any third party\u2019s objections to, appeals from or petitions to\nreconsider or reopen any approval, opinion, exemption or other authorization obtained from the STB, and take all such further action as in the reasonable\njudgment of CPRL and KCS may facilitate obtaining STB final approval.\nSTB final approval is required in order to transfer control of the trust stock from the trustee to merger holdco. If an STB denial occurs, CPRL will be\nobligated to, directly or indirectly, divest the trust stock in accordance with the voting trust agreement, during a period of two years after such STB denial\nor such extension of the two-year period as the STB may approve. Any such post-closing disposition would be subject to the jurisdiction of the STB to\noversee CPRL\u2019s divestiture of the trust stock.\nCFIUS\nThe transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to review by CFIUS pursuant to Section 721. Under the terms of the merger\nagreement, CPRL may not assume control over KCS\u2019s railroad operations until the parties have obtained completion of the CFIUS Process.\nThe merger agreement provides for CPRL and KCS to cooperate regarding the preparation and filing with CFIUS of a declaration and/or a joint voluntary\nnotification in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. If the parties opt to file a declaration, CFIUS will initiate a 30-\ncalendar-day review period, at the end of which, if it determines that there are no unresolved national security concerns, CFIUS will conclude all action\nunder Section 721. Alternatively, CFIUS may (a) inform the parties that it is not able to conclude action under Section 721 on the basis of the declaration\nand that the parties may file a written notice to seek written confirmation from CFIUS that action under Section 721 has been concluded\u037e (b) request that\nthe parties file a written notice\u037e or (c) initiate a unilateral review of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. If the parties opt to file a\nwritten notice (whether in the first instance or after failing to obtain completion of the CFIUS process through a declaration filing) CFIUS will initiate a 45-\ncalendar-day review period, at the end of which it may (a) determine that there are no unresolved national security concerns and conclude all action under\nSection 721\u037e or (b) determine that certain circumstances warrant additional review, and commence an investigation for up to an additional 45 calendar\ndays (which may be extended by an additional 15 days in extraordinary circumstances). If CFIUS has no unresolved national security concerns at the end\nof the investigation, it will inform the parties it has concluded all action under Section 721. If CFIUS has unresolved national security concerns at the end\nof the investigation, it may send a report to the President of the United States, who may act to suspend or prohibit the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement.\nAt any time during the course of the CFIUS review or investigation, CFIUS may request that the parties take actions to mitigate any national security\nconcerns it has identified. Where CFIUS has completed all action with\n112\nTable of Contents\nrespect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the President of the United States has announced a decision not to exercise his\nauthority under Section 721 with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the President and CFIUS may not take any further\naction under Section 721 with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nCOFECE and the IFT\nPursuant to the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Law and the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law, consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement requires the approval of COFECE and the IFT, autonomous constitutional entities responsible for\nenforcing the Federal Economic Competition Law in the sectors of their respective jurisdiction, including reviewing and authorizing concentrations, when\napplicable. Such notifications may be submitted in parallel, and the procedures follow the same rules and legal time frame (as described below)\u037e\nnonetheless, in non-telecom transactions, the notification process before the IFT is usually more expeditious than the process before COFECE.\nThe merger agreement provides that KCS, CPRL, first merger sub and surviving merger sub were obligated to promptly, but in any event no later than 30\nbusiness days after the date of the merger agreement, file any and all notifications and report forms to the Mexican antitrust authorities, in each case as\nrequired under applicable law with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and take all other actions necessary to cause the\nexpiration or termination of the process under applicable law as soon as practicable.\nNotifications of the transaction were submitted to the IFT on October 4, 2021 and to COFECE on October 5, 2021. Each of the Mexican antitrust\nauthorities has 10 business days from the date the notifications were submitted to issue a request for information (\u201cRFI\u201d), and the parties to such\nproceedings will have 10 business days to respond (subject to an extension of up to 10 additional business days upon prior request). Once the response\nto such RFI is fulfilled, the Mexican antitrust authorities will each have 15 business days to issue a second RFI, and the parties will have 15 business\ndays to respond (subject to extensions of up to 55 additional business days upon prior request).\nThe Mexican antitrust authorities will each have 60 business days to review the transaction and issue a resolution from (i) the date on which the first RFI\nis fulfilled, (ii) if a second RFI is submitted, the date on which the second RFI is fulfilled, or (iii) if no RFI is submitted, the date notifications of the\ntransaction were submitted to the Mexican antitrust authorities. Further, in complex cases, the Mexican antitrust authorities can extend the review period\nfor up to 40 additional business days.\nIf the Mexican antitrust authorities identify competition concerns to the parties, the parties will have the opportunity, at any point after the initial\nnotification is submitted and before the review process has been completed, to offer conditions on which approval by the Mexican antitrust authorities\nwill be contingent. If such conditions are offered, the term for the Mexican antitrust authorities to issue a resolution will be restarted. If the Mexican\nantitrust authorities do not issue a resolution within the relevant review period (including any extension, if applicable), the transaction will be deemed\napproved. Failure to obtain clearance from the Mexican antitrust authorities precludes the parties from closing the transaction in Mexico. The statutory\nreview periods have not yet commenced in this jurisdiction.\nARTF and SCT\nKCS and CPRL (through KCSM) have filed notices with ARTF and SCT, which are responsible for regulating railroad services in Mexico, prior to the\neffective time. The purpose of such notices is to inform ARTF and SCT of the change in the indirect participation in the capital stock of KCSM upon\ncompletion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The notice process is for informational purposes only, and no approval is required\nfrom either ARTF or SCT to consummate the transaction. As part of this notice process, ARTF and/or SCT may request information from the new indirect\nshareholders of KCSM and of any change in the percentages of direct shareholding.\n113\nTable of Contents\nMexican Rail Union\nKCS has provided an informal notification to the Mexican rail union\u037e no approval on the part of the Mexican rail union is required in order to consummate\nthe transaction.\nFCC\nKCS is subject to regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. KCS holds, controls, and/or leases various licenses issued\nby the FCC for the operation of radio and microwave facilities and the use of associated spectrum over certain defined geographic areas. KCS uses its\nradio and microwave facilities to support its railroad operations and public safety related to those operations. FCC approval of the transfer of KCS\u2019s FCC\nlicenses will be required. Failure to receive FCC approval prior to transferring control of the FCC licenses could result in civil fines, revocation of the\nsubject licenses, and/or other remedial actions by the FCC. Initial approval from the FCC is expected before closing into the voting trust.\nIn October 2021, CPRL and KCS filed the required applications for FCC consent to the transfer of control of the subject licenses held by KCS from KCS to\nthe voting trust. In November 2021, CPRL and KCS anticipate that applications to transfer control of KCS as lessee or sublessee of certain FCC licenses\nwill be filed. Applications for FCC consent are potentially subject to public comment and possible oppositions of third parties, and require the FCC\naffirmatively to determine that the transfer of control serves the public interest. While CPRL and KCS believe that FCC approval will ultimately be\nobtained, this approval is not assured. CPRL and KCS anticipate, but cannot guarantee, receiving approval by the first quarter of 2022.\nAdditionally, if the transaction is consummated, then the FCC will also preside over a similar post-closing approval process, which would require the\nfiling of an application for authorization of transfer of control of the FCC licenses from the voting trust to CPRL. CPRL and KCS anticipate, but cannot\nguarantee, that the FCC will ultimately approve this post-closing transfer of control of the FCC licenses. CPRL and KCS are not aware of any cases where\nFCC approval did not follow STB approval.\nAppraisal or Dissenters\u2019 Rights",

A KCS stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and/or the\npreferred merger consideration, as applicable.\nHow to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights. If you are a KCS stockholder wishing to exercise the rights to seek an appraisal of your shares, you\nmust do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nyou must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but does not\notherwise contain voting instructions will, unless properly and timely revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger\nagreement\u037e if you vote by proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must vote against the adoption of the merger\nagreement or abstain from voting your shares\u037e\n\u2022\nyou must deliver to KCS a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the\nKCS special meeting and such demand must reasonably inform KCS of your identity and your intention to demand appraisal of your\nshares of KCS voting stock\u037e\n\u2022\nyou must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the closing of the transaction. You will lose your\nappraisal rights if you transfer such shares before the closing of the transaction\u037e and\n\u2022\nyou or second surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair\nvalue of such shares within 120 days after the closing of the transaction. The second surviving corporation is under no obligation to\nfile any such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the KCS\nstockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of KCS voting stock within the time\nprescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nVoting, electronically at the KCS special meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the adoption of the merger\nagreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition\nto and separate from any proxy or vote.\nWho May Exercise Appraisal Rights. Only a holder of record of shares of KCS voting stock issued and outstanding at the time a demand for appraisal is\nmade and that continue to be issued and outstanding and held of record by such holder immediately prior to the effective time may assert appraisal rights\nfor the shares of KCS voting stock registered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of\nrecord, fully and correctly, as the stockholder\u2019s name appears on the stock certificates (or in the stock ledger). The demand for appraisal must reasonably\ninform KCS of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its KCS voting stock. Beneficial owners\nwho do not also hold their shares of KCS voting stock of record may not directly make appraisal demands to KCS. The beneficial holder must, in such\ncases, have the owner of record, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of KCS\nvoting stock of record. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds shares of KCS voting stock as a nominee for others,\nmay exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with respect to the shares of KCS voting stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising\nthis right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of KCS voting stock as to which appraisal is\nsought. Where no number of shares of KCS voting stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of KCS voting stock\nheld in the name of the record owner.\nIF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH\n115\nTable of Contents\nYOUR BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE\nBANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL\nINTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER\nNOMINEE, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS\nNECESSARY TO PERFECT YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nIf you own shares of KCS voting stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be\nexecuted by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for\nappraisal for a stockholder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand,\nsuch person is acting as agent for the record owner. If you hold shares of KCS voting stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a\ncentral securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository\nnominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.\nIf you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand to:\nKansas City Southern\n427 West 12th Street,\nKansas City, Missouri 64105\n1-888-800-3690\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nThe Second Surviving Corporation\u2019s Actions After the Closing of the Transaction. If the transaction closes, the second surviving corporation will give\nwritten notice of the closing of the transaction within 10 days after the closing of the transaction to you if you did not vote in favor of adoption of the\nmerger agreement and you made a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the closing\nof the transaction, if you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party, you have the right to withdraw the\ndemand and to accept the merger consideration or the preferred merger consideration, as applicable, in accordance with the merger agreement for your\nshares of KCS voting stock. Within 120 days after the closing of the transaction, but not later, either you, provided you have complied with the\nrequirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, or the second surviving corporation may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, with a copy served on the second surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by you, demanding a determination of the fair\nvalue of the shares of KCS voting stock held by all dissenting stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. The second surviving corporation is\nunder no obligation to file an appraisal petition and has no intention of doing so. If you desire to have your shares appraised, you should initiate any\npetitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the closing of the transaction, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to\nreceive from the second surviving corporation, upon your written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of\nthe adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which KCS has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those\nshares. The second surviving corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of 10 days of receipt of the request or 10 days after expiration of\nthe period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of KCS voting stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on\nyour behalf you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the second surviving corporation the statement described in this\nparagraph. As noted above, however, a demand for appraisal may only be made by or on behalf of a holder of record of shares of KCS voting stock. If a\npetition for appraisal is duly filed by you or\n116\nTable of Contents\nanother record holder of KCS voting stock who has properly exercised his or her appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the\nDGCL, the second surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the office of the\nRegister in Chancery in which the petition was filed with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded\nan appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may order the Register in Chancery to give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition by registered or\ncertified mail to the second surviving corporation and to the stockholders shown on such duly verified list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice\nwill also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in at least one newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,\nDelaware, or in another publication deemed advisable by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs of these notices are borne by the second surviving\ncorporation. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders\ndemanding appraisal who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of\nthe appraisal proceedings and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss from the proceedings any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction.\nIf immediately before a merger the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed\non a national securities exchange, the Delaware Court of Chancery shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise\nentitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible\nfor appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the transaction for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million or (3) the merger was\napproved pursuant to Section 253 or 267 of the DGCL. The KCS voting stock is listed on NYSE and therefore this provision may be applicable in respect\nthereof, to the extent that KCS voting stock continues to be listed on NYSE until immediately before the transaction.\nAfter determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of KCS voting stock, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the\nshares of KCS voting stock owned by such stockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value of the shares of KCS voting stock at the closing\nof the transaction held by dissenting stockholders who have properly exercised their appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the transaction, together with interest, if any, to be paid. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the closing of the transaction\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the closing of the transaction and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time\nbefore the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the second surviving corporation may pay to each KCS stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in\ncash (which will be treated as an advance against the payment due to such KCS stockholder), in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only\nupon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\nand (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the fair value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of\nthe fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the second surviving corporation to the KCS stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be\nso made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and in the case of holders of shares of KCS voting stock\nrepresented by certificates upon the surrender to the second surviving corporation of such stockholder\u2019s certificates.\nIn determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware\nSupreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered\nand that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of\n117\nTable of Contents\na company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained as of the closing date which throw any light\non future prospects of the combined company. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from\nthe accomplishment or expectation of the transaction.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a\n\u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from\nsuch accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that \u201celements of future\nvalue, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may\nbe considered.\u201d\nAn opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to,\nand does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of KCS voting stock as determined under Section\n262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger consideration and/or the preferred merger consideration, as\napplicable.\nCPRL does not anticipate offering more than the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, to any KCS stockholder exercising\nappraisal rights and reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any\nappraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of KCS voting stock is less than the value of the merger\nconsideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery.\nIf no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the closing date or, assuming the shares of KCS voting stock remain listed on a national\nsecurities exchange immediately before the transaction, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied, then all KCS stockholders will\nlose the right to an appraisal, and will instead receive the merger consideration and/or the preferred merger consideration, as applicable, described in the\nmerger agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate those costs to the parties as the Delaware Court\nof Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances. Each KCS stockholder party to the appraisal proceeding is responsible for its own\nattorneys\u2019 fees and expert witnesses\u2019 fees and expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a\nportion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\nand the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of KCS voting stock entitled to appraisal.\nIf you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after the effective date of the transaction, vote\nthe shares of KCS voting stock subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends\nor other distributions payable to holders of record of KCS voting stock as of a record date prior to the effective date of the transaction.\nIf you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party, you may withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept\nthe merger consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger to the second surviving\ncorporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require written approval of the second\nsurviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that\nthis provision will not affect the right of any KCS stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for\n118\nTable of Contents\nappraisal and to accept the terms offered in the transaction within 60 days after the effective date of the transaction. If you fail to perfect, successfully\nwithdraw your demand for appraisal, or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of KCS voting stock will be converted into the right to receive\nthe merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In that event,\nyou will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration for your shares of KCS voting stock in accordance with the merger agreement. In view\nof the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a KCS stockholder and are considering exercising your appraisal rights under\nthe DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and financial advisor.\nTHE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH THE PREREQUISITES OF SECTION\n262 OF THE DGCL. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL AND\nFINANCIAL ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY\nINCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.\nRestrictions on Resales of CPRL Common Shares Received in the Transaction",

All holders of KCS voting stock should consult their own tax advisors as to\nthe specific tax consequences to them of the transaction and of the ownership and disposition of CPRL common shares, including with respect to\nreporting requirements and the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws in light of their particular\ncircumstances.\nHolders of KCS voting stock that are not U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possibility that, in the event the applicable\nwithholding agent is unable to determine whether any cash consideration should be treated as a dividend for applicable U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, such withholding agent may withhold U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable\nincome tax treaty) on the entire amount of cash consideration payable to them in the transaction, and such holders should consult their own tax advisors\nas to the possible desirability and timing of selling any CPRL common shares or shares of KCS voting stock that they own.\nUnder Section 367(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, special rules may apply to a U.S. holder that actually or constructively owns\n5% or more, by vote or value, of the issued and outstanding stock of CPRL immediately after the completion of the transaction. Any such U.S. holder is\nurged to consult such U.S. holder\u2019s own tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction with regard to such U.S.\nholder\u2019s particular circumstances, including with respect to the possibility of entering into a \u201cgain\n121\nTable of Contents\nrecognition agreement\u201d and otherwise complying with the requirements of that agreement and Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8 for avoiding\nthe recognition of gain.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transaction\nIn General\nCPRL and KCS intend that the transaction will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that Section 367(a)(1) of\nthe Code will not apply to cause the transaction to result in gain recognition by holders of KCS common stock that exchange their shares of KCS common\nstock for the merger consideration (other than any excepted shareholder). The obligation of KCS to complete the transaction is conditioned upon the\nreceipt of an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, special counsel to KCS, or another nationally recognized tax counsel, to the effect that, on the\nbasis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the transaction will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that the transaction will not result in gain recognition under Section 367(a)(1) of the Code by holders of KCS\ncommon stock (other than any excepted shareholder). This opinion will be based on certain facts, representations, assumptions and statements, including\nthose contained in the merger agreement and in tax representation letters provided by CPRL and KCS. If any of these facts, representations, assumptions\nor statements underlying the tax opinion described above is or becomes incorrect, incomplete, or is violated, the validity of, and the conclusions reached\nin, such tax opinion may be affected or jeopardized, and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction could differ materially from those\ndiscussed below. In addition, the opinion will be subject to certain qualifications and limitations as set forth therein.\nMoreover, the opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts, and neither CPRL nor KCS intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with respect to the\ntax consequences of the transaction. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court will not sustain, a position\ncontrary to any of the conclusions set forth in such opinion or the tax consequences described in the discussion below. In particular, if the transaction\nwere to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders of KCS common stock would be required to recognize gain or\nloss on their exchange of KCS common stock for the merger consideration. If the transaction qualified as a reorganization but were to fail to satisfy the\nrequirements of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, U.S. holders would be required to recognize the full amount of any gain, but not loss, on their exchange of\nKCS common stock for the merger consideration.\nOn the basis of the opinion described above that the transaction will be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code\nand that Section 367(a)(1) of the Code will not generally apply to cause the transaction to result in gain recognition to U.S. holders of KCS common stock\nthat exchange their shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration (other than any excepted shareholder), the following discussion describes\nthe material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S. holders of KCS common stock (other than excepted shareholders).\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders of KCS Common Stock\nU.S. holders of KCS common stock that exchange their shares of KCS common stock for a combination of CPRL common shares and cash in the\ntransaction will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of\nfractional CPRL common shares, if any) received by such U.S. holder in the transaction\u037e and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the amount of cash\n(excluding cash received in lieu of fractional CPRL common shares, if any) plus the fair market value of the CPRL common shares (including any fractional\nCPRL common shares deemed received) received by such U.S. holder in exchange for its shares of KCS common stock in the transaction, over (b) such\nU.S. holder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of KCS common stock exchanged. The tax basis of a U.S. holder of KCS common stock in such U.S. holder\u2019s KCS\ncommon stock will generally be equal to the amount paid for such stock.\nSubject to the discussion below regarding potential dividend treatment, any such gain will generally be capital gain. Any such capital gain will be long-\nterm capital gain if, as of the effective time, the U.S. holder\u2019s holding\n122\nTable of Contents\nperiod with respect to the surrendered shares of KCS common stock exceeds one year. A non-corporate U.S. holder\u2019s long-term capital gain may be taxed\nat lower rates.\nIn certain circumstances, cash consideration received in a transaction otherwise qualifying as a reorganization may be characterized as a dividend for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes rather than capital gain where the payment of such cash consideration has the effect of a distribution of a dividend. Whether\nthe payment of such consideration has that effect is generally determined by treating the cash as if it were the proceeds of a hypothetical redemption by\nthe acquirer (or its parent) of additional share consideration deemed issued in the acquisition. If the receipt of cash in such deemed redemption would be\ntreated as a distribution to the U.S. holder with respect to CPRL under the tests set forth in Section 302 of the Code, the gain recognized pursuant to the\ntransaction by such U.S. holder would be treated as dividend income to the extent of such U.S. holder\u2019s ratable share of the accumulated earnings and\nprofits as calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS has ruled that gain is generally not recharacterized as a dividend under this rule in the\ncase of an exchanging shareholder in a public corporation whose relative stock interest is minimal and who exercises no control with respect to corporate\naffairs. Based on this and other applicable legal authority, and on the relevant facts (including the relative amount of the cash component of the merger\nconsideration), cash consideration received by holders of KCS common stock in the transaction is generally not expected to be treated as a dividend.\nHowever, these rules are complex and because the possibility of dividend treatment depends upon each U.S. holder\u2019s particular circumstances, including\nthe application of constructive ownership rules, U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules to them.\nThe aggregate tax basis of the CPRL common shares a U.S. holder receives in the transaction (including any fractional CPRL common shares deemed\nreceived) will generally be the same as such U.S. holder\u2019s aggregate tax basis in its shares of KCS common stock surrendered in exchange therefor,\ndecreased by the amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional shares, if any) such U.S. holder receives and increased by the amount of\ngain (excluding any gain recognized with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share), if any, such U.S. holder recognizes in the transaction. The\nholding period of the CPRL common shares received by a U.S. holder in the transaction will include such U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of\nKCS common stock surrendered in the transaction.\nU.S. holders who hold shares of KCS common stock with differing tax bases and/or holding periods, which generally occurs when blocks of shares are\npurchased at different times or at different prices, should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the particular U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the transaction to them.\nA U.S. holder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional CPRL share in the transaction generally will be treated as having received such fractional share in\nthe transaction and then as having received cash in exchange for such fractional CPRL share. Gain or loss generally will be recognized based on the\ndifference between the amount of cash received in lieu of the fractional CPRL share and the portion of the U.S. holder\u2019s aggregate tax basis in the shares\nof KCS common stock surrendered allocable to the fractional CPRL share. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-\nterm capital gain or loss if the holding period for the shares of KCS common stock is more than one year on the closing date of the transaction. A non-\ncorporate U.S. holder\u2019s long-term capital gain may be taxed at lower rates. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations.\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders of KCS Preferred Stock\nThe exchange of shares of KCS preferred stock for cash in the transaction will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a\nU.S. holder of KCS preferred stock whose shares of KCS preferred stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the transaction will recognize\ncapital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares\n(determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes, as described below under \u201cBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\u201d) and\nthe U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A\n123\nTable of Contents\nU.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in KCS preferred stock will generally equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such KCS preferred stock. Any such capital\ngain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss where the U.S. holder\u2019s holding period for such KCS preferred stock is more than one year on the\nclosing date of the transaction. A non-corporate U.S. holder\u2019s long-term capital gain may be taxed at lower rates. Deductions for capital losses are subject\nto limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of KCS preferred stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its\nadjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of KCS preferred stock.\nU.S. holders who hold both KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the particular U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of the transaction to them.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders of CPRL Shares\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations\nBased on the composition of CPRL\u2019s current gross assets and income and the manner in which CPRL expects to operate its business in future years, CPRL\nbelieves, and the following discussion assumes, that CPRL will not be classified as a passive foreign investment company (a \u201cPFIC\u201d) for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes for its current taxable year and does not expect to be so classified in the foreseeable future. The tests to determine whether a\ncompany is a PFIC apply annually and a company\u2019s status can change depending, among other things, on changes in the composition and relative value\nof its gross receipts and assets, changes in its operations and changes in the market value of its stock. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that CPRL\nwill not be a PFIC for its current or any future taxable year. If CPRL were to be a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder owned CPRL\ncommon shares, such U.S. holder generally would be subject, in that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years (whether or not CPRL continued to be\na PFIC), to materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including that gain from a sale or other disposition of CPRL common shares, as well\nas certain distributions on CPRL common shares, would be subject to tax at the highest ordinary income tax rates and an interest charge and U.S. holders\nwould be subject to additional information reporting requirements. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the potential application of\nthe PFIC rules.\nDividends\nSubject to the preceding discussion of special rules applicable to PFICs, the gross amount of any distribution of cash with respect to CPRL common\nshares will be included in a U.S. holder\u2019s gross income as a dividend to the extent of CPRL\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined\nunder U.S. federal income tax laws. CPRL does not expect to maintain calculations of earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore,\na U.S. holder should expect that any such distribution will generally be treated as a dividend from foreign sources when actually or constructively\nreceived. Dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally available to U.S. corporations. Dividends received from a\n\u201cqualified foreign corporation\u201d by eligible non-corporate U.S. holders that satisfy a minimum holding period and certain other requirements generally will\nbe taxed at the preferential rate applicable to qualified dividend income. CPRL will be treated as a qualified foreign corporation if its shares are readily\ntradable on an established securities market in the United States or CPRL qualifies for comprehensive benefits under the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty\nand CPRL is not a PFIC for either the taxable year of distribution or prior taxable years. U.S. Treasury guidance indicates that shares listed on the NYSE\nwill be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. There can be no assurance, however, that CPRL common\nshares will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in future years.\nDividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be included in income in a U.S. dollar amount based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the\ndividend is distributed, whether or not the currency is converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A U.S. holder\u2019s tax basis in the non-U.S. currency will equal\nthe U.S. dollar amount included in income. Any gain or loss realized on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the non-U.S. currency for a\ndifferent U.S. dollar amount generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss. If dividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars are converted\ninto U.S. dollars on the day they are distributed, a U.S. holder generally will not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the\ndividend income.\n124\nTable of Contents\nU.S. holders must include any tax withheld from a dividend payment in this gross amount even though they do not in fact receive such withheld tax.\nSubject to certain limitations, Canadian tax withheld and paid over to Canada will be creditable or deductible against U.S. holders\u2019 U.S. federal income tax\nliability. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to preferential tax rates for qualified\ndividend income. To the extent a refund of the tax withheld is available to U.S. holders under Canadian law or under the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty, the\namount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against such U.S. holders\u2019 U.S. federal income tax liability.\nSales or Other Dispositions of CPRL Shares\nSubject to the preceding discussion of special rules applicable to PFICs, a U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other\ndisposition of CPRL common shares in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized and the U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in the CPRL common shares disposed. Any gain or loss generally will be treated as arising from U.S. sources and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the U.S. holder\u2019s holding period exceeds one year. Deductions for capital loss are subject to significant limitations.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIn general, information reporting requirements may apply to cash payments made to U.S. holders in connection with the transaction and in respect of\nCPRL common shares, unless an exemption applies. Backup withholding tax may apply to amounts subject to information reporting if the applicable\nstockholder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number, fails to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal\nincome tax returns or otherwise fails to establish an exemption from backup withholding. U.S. holders can claim a credit against their U.S. federal income\ntax liability for the amount of any backup withholding tax and a refund of any excess, provided that all required information is timely provided to the IRS.\nU.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for establishing an\nexemption.\nTHE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A\nPARTICULAR HOLDER. THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTION AND OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF CPRL SHARES WILL\nDEPEND ON A HOLDER\u2019S SPECIFIC SITUATION. EACH HOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT SUCH HOLDER\u2019S OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT\nTHE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF THE TRANSACTION AND HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF CPRL SHARES IN LIGHT OF THE HOLDER\u2019S\nOWN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX\nLAWS.",

This summary is not intended to be, nor\nshould it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular holder. No representations are made with respect to the income tax consequences to any\nparticular holder. Holders resident or subject to taxation in a jurisdiction other than Canada should be aware that the transaction may have tax\nconsequences both in Canada and in such other jurisdiction. Such consequences are not described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors\nwith respect to the income tax consequences of the transaction in their particular circumstances, including the application and effect of the income and\nother tax laws of any applicable country, province, state or local tax authority.\nApplication\nThe following summary describes the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable under the Canadian tax act to a beneficial\nowner of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock, as the case may be, who disposes, or is deemed to have disposed, of KCS common stock or KCS\npreferred stock, as applicable, in connection with the first merger and who, for the purposes of the Canadian tax act and at all relevant times, (i) deals at\narm\u2019s length with and is not affiliated with CPRL, the merger subs or KCS\u037e and (ii) holds all KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock, and will hold all\nCPRL common shares acquired pursuant to the first merger, as applicable (which we refer to, collectively, in this portion of the summary as the\n\u201cSecurities\u201d) as capital property (which we refer to in this portion of the summary as a \u201cholder\u201d). Generally, the Securities will be considered to be capital\nproperty to a holder for purposes of the Canadian tax act, provided that the holder does not use or hold those Securities in the course of carrying on a\nbusiness and has not acquired such Securities in one or more transactions considered to be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.\nThis summary is not applicable to a holder: (i) that is a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d for the purposes of the \u201cmark-to-market property\u201d rules, (ii) that is a\n\u201cspecified financial institution,\u201d (iii) an interest in which would be a \u201ctax shelter investment,\u201d (iv) that has elected to determine its \u201cCanadian tax results\u201d\nin a currency other than Canadian currency pursuant to the functional currency reporting rules, (v) that has entered or will enter into, in respect of any\nSecurities, a \u201cderivative forward agreement\u201d or a \u201csynthetic disposition arrangement,\u201d (vi) that is a partnership, or (vii) in respect of which KCS is a\n\u201cforeign affiliate,\u201d all within the meaning of the Canadian tax act. Any such holders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular\nCanadian federal income tax consequences to them of the transaction.\nAdditional considerations, not discussed herein, may be applicable to a holder that is a corporation resident in Canada and is, or becomes, or does not\ndeal at arm\u2019s length for purposes of the Canadian tax act with a corporation resident in Canada that is or becomes, as part of a transaction or series of\ntransactions or events that includes the acquisition of CPRL common shares, controlled by a non-resident person, or if no single non-resident person has\nor acquires control, by a group of non-resident persons not dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length for purposes of the \u201cforeign affiliate dumping\u201d rules in\nsection 212.3 of the Canadian tax act. Such holders should consult their own tax advisors.\nThis summary does not address issues relevant to KCS voting stock holders who acquired their KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock on the\nexercise of an employee stock option or pursuant to another employee incentive award. Such holders should consult their own tax advisors.\nCanadian Currency\nFor the purposes of the Canadian tax act, subject to certain exceptions (including where a taxpayer has made an election to compute its \u201cCanadian tax\nresults\u201d in a currency other than Canadian currency), all amounts relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of KCS common stock, KCS preferred\nstock and CPRL common shares\n126\nTable of Contents\n(including dividends, adjusted cost base and proceeds of disposition), as applicable, must be converted into Canadian dollars for the purposes of the\nCanadian tax act. Amounts denominated in a foreign currency must be converted into Canadian dollars using the exchange rate quoted by the Bank of\nCanada for the day on which the amount arose, or, if there is no such rate quoted for the particular day, the closest preceding day for which such a rate is\nquoted, in accordance with the Canadian tax act.\nHolders Resident in Canada\nThe following portion of the summary is generally applicable to a holder who, at all relevant times and for purposes of the Canadian tax act and any\napplicable income tax treaty or convention, is or is deemed to be resident in Canada and is not exempt from tax under Part I of the Canadian tax act (which\nwe refer to in this portion of the summary as a \u201cCanadian resident holder\u201d).\nDisposition of KCS Common Stock\nA Canadian resident holder who disposes of KCS common stock in connection with the first merger will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) equal to the\namount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base to the\nCanadian resident holder of its KCS common stock, determined immediately before the disposition. The proceeds of disposition to the Canadian resident\nholder will be equal to the sum of the aggregate of the fair market value of the CPRL common shares and the cash consideration received on the\ndisposition (including cash received in lieu of a fractional CPRL common share). For a description of the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses,\nsee the subsection entitled \u201cTaxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses,\u201d on page 128.\nU.S. tax, if any, levied on any gain realized on a disposition of shares of KCS common stock in connection with the first merger may be eligible for a\nforeign tax credit under the Canadian tax act to the extent and under the circumstances described in the Canadian tax act. Canadian resident holders\nshould consult their own tax advisors with respect to the availability of a foreign tax credit, having regarding to their particular circumstances.\nThe cost to a Canadian resident holder of CPRL common shares received by that Canadian resident holder as a result of the first merger will be equal to\ntheir fair market value at the time they are acquired by such Canadian resident holder. For purposes of determining the adjusted cost base of CPRL\ncommon shares, the cost of the CPRL common shares acquired must be averaged with the adjusted cost base of all other CPRL common shares held by\nthe Canadian resident holder as capital property, subject to the detailed provisions of the Canadian tax act.\nDisposition of KCS Preferred Stock\nA Canadian resident holder who disposes of KCS preferred stock as a result of the first merger will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) equal to the\namount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base to the\nCanadian resident holder of its KCS preferred stock, determined immediately before the disposition. The proceeds of disposition to the Canadian resident\nholder will be equal to the cash consideration received on the disposition of the Canadian resident holder\u2019s KCS preferred stock. For a description of the\ntax treatment of capital gains and capital losses, see the subsection entitled \u201cTaxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses,\u201d on page 128.\nU.S. tax, if any, levied on any gain realized on a disposition of shares of KCS preferred stock in connection with the first merger may be eligible for a\nforeign tax credit under the Canadian tax act to the extent and under the circumstances described in the Canadian tax act. Canadian resident holders\nshould consult their own tax advisors with respect to the availability of a foreign tax credit, having regarding to their particular circumstances.\n127\nTable of Contents\nAppraisal Rights\nA Canadian resident holder who disposes of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock on the valid exercise of appraisal rights will realize a capital gain\n(or capital loss) equal to the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the\nadjusted cost base to the Canadian resident holder of its KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock, as applicable, determined immediately before the\ndisposition. The proceeds of disposition to the Canadian resident holder will be equal to the cash consideration received on the disposition. For a\ndescription of the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses, see the subsection entitled \u201cTaxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses,\u201d on page\n128. Canadian resident holders who are considering exercising appraisal rights should consult their tax advisors for the tax and other implications thereof.\nU.S. tax, if any, levied on any gain realized on a disposition of shares of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock on the exercise of appraisal rights may\nbe eligible for a foreign tax credit under the Canadian tax act to the extent and under the circumstances described in the Canadian tax act. Canadian\nresident holders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the availability of a foreign tax credit, having regarding to their particular\ncircumstances.\nDividends on CPRL Common Shares (Post-Transaction)\nA Canadian resident holder who is an individual (other than certain trusts) will be required to include in income any dividends received or deemed to be\nreceived on the CPRL common shares, and will be subject to the gross-up and dividend tax credit rules applicable to taxable dividends received from\ntaxable Canadian corporations, including the enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit rules applicable to any dividends designated by CPRL as\n\u201celigible dividends\u201d as defined in the Canadian tax act. Although there can be no assurance that any dividend paid by CPRL will be designated as an\n\u201celigible dividend,\u201d CPRL has posted notification on its website that, unless otherwise indicated, dividends on CPRL common shares are designated as\n\u201celigible dividends\u201d for purposes of the Canadian tax act. Dividends received or deemed to be received by an individual and certain trusts may give rise\nto a liability for minimum tax under the Canadian tax act.\nDividends received (or deemed to be received) on a CPRL common share by a Canadian resident holder that is a corporation will be included in computing\nsuch Canadian resident holder\u2019s income for the taxation year and will generally also be deductible in computing its taxable income for that taxation year.\nIn certain circumstances, a dividend received (or deemed to be received) by a Canadian resident holder that is a corporation may be deemed to be\nproceeds of disposition or a capital gain pursuant to subsection 55(2) of the Canadian tax act. Canadian resident holders that are corporations should\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding their particular circumstances. A Canadian resident holder that is a \u201cprivate corporation\u201d or a \u201csubject\ncorporation,\u201d each as defined in the Canadian tax act, will generally be liable to pay an additional tax under Part IV of the Canadian tax act, all or a portion\nof which may be refundable in certain circumstances, on dividends received, or deemed to be received, on a CPRL common share to the extent such\ndividends are deductible in computing the Canadian resident holder\u2019s taxable income. A Canadian resident holder of CPRL common shares that is,\nthroughout the year, a \u201cCanadian-controlled private corporation,\u201d as defined in the Canadian tax act, may be subject to an additional tax (all or a portion\nof which may be refundable in certain circumstances) on its \u201caggregate investment income,\u201d which is defined to include dividends that are not deductible\nin computing taxable income.\nDisposition of CPRL Common Shares (Post-Transaction)\nA Canadian resident holder who disposes or is deemed to dispose of a CPRL common share after the transaction will recognize a capital gain (or a capital\nloss) equal to the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted\ncost base to the Canadian resident holder of such CPRL common share, determined immediately before the disposition. For a description of the tax\ntreatment of capital gains and capital losses, see the subsection entitled \u201cTaxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses\u201d immediately below.\n128\nTable of Contents\nTaxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses\nGenerally, one-half of any capital gain realized by a Canadian resident holder in a taxation year will be included in computing the Canadian resident\nholder\u2019s income in that taxation year as a taxable capital gain and one-half of any capital loss realized in a taxation year (which we refer to as an \u201callowable\ncapital loss\u201d) must be deducted from the taxable capital gains realized by the Canadian resident holder in the same taxation year, in accordance with the\nrules contained in the Canadian tax act. Allowable capital losses in excess of taxable capital gains realized by a Canadian resident holder in a particular\ntaxation year may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent taxation\nyear against net taxable capital gains realized by the Canadian resident holder in such taxation year, subject to and in accordance with the rules contained\nin the Canadian tax act.\nCapital gains realized by an individual and certain trusts may give rise to a liability for minimum tax under the Canadian tax act. A Canadian resident holder\nthat is, throughout the year, a \u201cCanadian-controlled private corporation,\u201d as defined in the Canadian tax act, may be subject to an additional tax (all or a\nportion of which may be refundable in certain circumstances) on its \u201caggregate investment income,\u201d which is defined to include taxable capital gains.\nThe amount of any capital loss realized by a Canadian resident holder that is a corporation on the disposition of a CPRL common share may be reduced\nby the amount of dividends received or deemed to be received by it on such share (or on a share for which the share has been substituted) to the extent\nand under the circumstances prescribed by the Canadian tax act. Similar rules may apply where a corporation is a member of a partnership or a beneficiary\nof a trust that owns shares, directly or indirectly through a partnership or a trust. Canadian resident holders to whom these rules may apply should\nconsult their own tax advisors.\nEligibility for Investment\nBased on the current provisions of the Canadian tax act and subject to the provision of any particular plan, provided that the CPRL common shares are\nlisted on a \u201cdesignated stock exchange,\u201d within the meaning of the Canadian tax act (which currently includes the TSX and the NYSE), or CPRL is\notherwise a \u201cpublic corporation\u201d (other than a \u201cmortgage investment corporation\u201d) for purposes of the Canadian tax act, the CPRL common shares will be\nqualified investments under the Canadian tax act for a trust governed by a registered retirement savings plan (which we refer to as \u201cRRSP\u201d), a registered\nretirement income fund (which we refer to as \u201cRRIF\u201d), a registered disability savings plan (which we refer to as \u201cRDSP\u201d), a registered education savings\nplan (which we refer to as \u201cRESP\u201d), a tax-free savings account (which we refer to as \u201cTFSA\u201d) or a deferred profit sharing plan, each as defined in the\nCanadian tax act.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the CPRL common shares are \u201cprohibited investments,\u201d within the meaning of the Canadian tax act, for a particular\nRRSP, RRIF, RDSP, RESP or TFSA, the annuitant of the RRSP or RRIF, the holder of the TFSA or RDSP, or the subscriber of the RESP, as the case may be,\nwill be subject to a penalty tax under the Canadian tax act. The CPRL common shares will generally not be a \u201cprohibited investment\u201d for these purposes\nunless the annuitant under the RRSP or RRIF, the holder of the TFSA or RDSP, or the subscriber of the RESP, as applicable, (i) does not deal at arm\u2019s\nlength with CPRL for purposes of the Canadian tax act, or (ii) has a \u201csignificant interest,\u201d as defined in the Canadian tax act, in CPRL. In addition, the\nCPRL common shares will generally not be a \u201cprohibited investment\u201d if the CPRL common shares are \u201cexcluded property\u201d for purposes of the prohibited\ninvestment rules for an RRSP, RRIF, RDSP, RESP or TFSA. Annuitants under RRSPs or RRIFs, holders of TFSAs or RDSPs, and subscribers of RESPs\nshould consult their own tax advisors as to whether the CPRL common shares will be prohibited investments in their particular circumstances.\n129\nTable of Contents\nHolders Not Resident in Canada\nThe following portion of the summary is generally applicable to a holder who, at all relevant times and for purposes of the Canadian tax act, is not, and is\nnot deemed to be, a resident of Canada and does not use or hold, and is not deemed to use or hold, KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock, as the\ncase may be, and will not use or hold, or be deemed to use or hold, CPRL common shares, as applicable, in a business carried on in Canada (which we\nrefer to in this portion of the summary as a \u201cnon-Canadian resident holder\u201d). This portion of the summary is not generally applicable to a non-Canadian\nresident holder that is: (i) an insurer carrying on an insurance business in Canada and elsewhere or (ii) an \u201cauthorized foreign bank\u201d (as defined in the\nCanadian tax act).\nThe following portion of the summary assumes that none of the KCS common stock, KCS preferred stock, or CPRL common shares will constitute\n\u201ctaxable Canadian property\u201d to any particular non-Canadian resident holder at any time. Generally, KCS common stock, KCS preferred stock, or CPRL\ncommon shares, as the case may be, will not constitute taxable Canadian property to a non-Canadian resident holder at a particular time, provided that the\napplicable shares are listed at that time on a \u201cdesignated stock exchange\u201d (which currently includes the NYSE and the TSX), unless at any particular time\nduring the 60-month period that ends at that time (i) one or any combination of (a) the non-Canadian resident holder, (b) persons with whom the non-\nCanadian resident holder does not deal at arm\u2019s length, and (c) partnerships in which the non-Canadian resident holder or a person described in (b) holds\na membership interest directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships, owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of the capital\nstock of KCS or CPRL, as the case may be, and (ii) more than 50% of the fair market value of KCS common stock, KCS preferred stock or CPRL common\nshares, as the case may be, was derived directly or indirectly from one or any combination of: (A) real or immovable properties situated in Canada, (B)\n\u201cCanadian resource properties\u201d (as defined in the Canadian tax act), (C) \u201ctimber resource properties\u201d (as defined in the Canadian tax act), and (D) options\nin respect of, or interests in, any of the foregoing property whether or not the property exists. In certain circumstances set out in the Canadian tax act,\nshares which are not otherwise \u201ctaxable Canadian property\u201d may be deemed to be \u201ctaxable Canadian property.\u201d\nKCS has represented in the merger agreement that, at no time during the 60 months immediately preceding the effective time, will more than 50% of the fair\nmarket value of KCS voting stock be derived, directly or indirectly, from one or any combination of the properties listed in (ii)(A) to (D) above. Assuming\nthe accuracy of this representation, the KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock will not be \u201ctaxable Canadian property\u201d to non-Canadian resident\nholders at the time of their disposition in connection with the first merger for purposes of the Canadian tax act.\nDisposition of KCS Common Stock or KCS Preferred Stock in Connection with the First Merger\nA non-Canadian resident holder will not be subject to tax under the Canadian tax act on any capital gain realized on a disposition of KCS common stock\nor KCS preferred stock, as the case may be, in connection with the first merger unless the shares are \u201ctaxable Canadian property\u201d to the non-Canadian\nresident holder and the shares are not \u201ctreaty-protected property\u201d of the non-Canadian resident holder, each within the meaning of the Canadian tax act.\nNon-Canadian resident holders whose KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock are \u201ctaxable Canadian property\u201d should consult their own tax\nadvisors for advice having regard to their particular circumstances, including whether their KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock constitute\n\u201ctreaty-protected property.\u201d As shares of the capital stock of a U.S. corporation, the KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock will generally be\n\u201ctreaty-protected property\u201d for a non-Canadian resident holder who is a resident of the United States for purposes of, and entitled to benefits under, the\nU.S.-Canada income tax treaty.\n130\nTable of Contents\nAppraisal Rights\nA non-Canadian resident holder will not be subject to tax under the Canadian tax act on any capital gain realized on a disposition of KCS common stock\nor KCS preferred stock, as the case may be, pursuant to the valid exercise of appraisal rights unless the shares are \u201ctaxable Canadian property\u201d to the\nnon-Canadian resident holder and the shares are not \u201ctreaty-protected property\u201d of the non-Canadian resident holder, each within the meaning of the\nCanadian tax act.\nDividends on CPRL Common Shares (Post-Transaction)\nDividends paid or credited, or deemed to be paid or credited, on CPRL common shares to a non-Canadian resident holder generally will be subject to\nCanadian withholding tax at a rate of 25% of the gross amount of the dividend, unless the rate is reduced under the provisions of an applicable income tax\nconvention between Canada and the non-Canadian resident holder\u2019s jurisdiction of residence. For example, the rate of withholding tax under the U.S.-\nCanada income tax treaty applicable to a non-Canadian resident holder who is a resident of the United States for the purposes of such treaty, is the\nbeneficial owner of the dividend and who is entitled to all of the benefits under such treaty, generally will be 15%. CPRL will be required to withhold the\nrequired amount of withholding tax from the dividend, and remit it to the CRA for the account of the non-Canadian resident holder. Non-Canadian\nresident holders who may be eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax on dividends pursuant to an applicable income tax convention should consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to taking all appropriate steps in this regard.\nDisposition of CPRL Common Shares (Post-Transaction)\nA non-Canadian resident holder will not be subject to tax under the Canadian tax act on any capital gain realized on a disposition of CPRL common\nshares, unless the shares are \u201ctaxable Canadian property\u201d to the non-Canadian resident holder and the shares are not \u201ctreaty-protected property\u201d of the\nnon-Canadian resident holder, each within the meaning of the Canadian tax act.\n131\nTable of Contents\nTHE ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL",

            "text": "THE VOTING TRUST\nThe summary of certain terms of the voting trust below and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the\nfull text of the form of the voting trust agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A to the merger agreement, which is incorporated by reference\ninto this proxy statement/prospectus. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not provide all of the information about the voting trust\nthat might be important to you. You are urged to read the form of voting trust agreement carefully and in its entirety because it is the legal document\nthat governs the transaction.\nUnder the voting trust agreement, immediately following the post-closing contributions, merger holdco will deposit or cause to be deposited with the\ntrustee the certificates of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation, creating an irrevocable voting trust in respect\nof the trust stock. Upon depositing the trust stock, merger holdco will receive voting trust certificates representing the deposited shares (which we\ncollectively refer to as the \u201ctrust certificates\u201d). In its capacity as the trustee, the trustee will be required to vote all trust stock as further described below.\nAlthough merger holdco will remain the beneficial owner of the trust stock, CPRL and merger holdco will be unable to exercise control over KCS while the\ntrust stock is held by the trustee.\nThe voting trust agreement requires the trustee to vote all trust stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or desirable to effect, or consistent\nwith the effectuation of, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and, until the STB has issued a final order approving the transaction\nand common control of KCS by CPRL, against any proposed merger, business combination or similar transaction involving KCS but not involving CPRL\nor one of its affiliates. On other matters (including the election or removal of directors), the trustee generally will vote the trust stock in the trustee\u2019s sole\ndiscretion, unless merger holdco, as the holder of a trust certificate, with the prior written approval of the STB, directs the trustee as to any such vote\nwith respect to the trust stock represented by such trust certificate. Under the voting trust agreement, the trustee is generally prohibited from exercising\nthe voting powers of the trust stock in any way that would create any dependence or intercorporate relationship between (i) CPRL or its affiliates, on the\none hand, and (ii) KCS or its affiliates, on the other hand, and is also prohibited from selling, leasing, assigning, transferring, alienating, pledging,\nencumbering or hypothecating the trust stock and/or any major assets of KCS.\nPending the termination of the voting trust, the trustee will pay to merger holdco, as registered holder of the trust certificates, all cash dividends and cash\ndistributions on the trust stock. Under the voting trust agreement, and notwithstanding the foregoing, CPRL may at any time cause merger holdco to sell\nor otherwise dispose of all or any part of the trust stock, subject to obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals. With respect to any such sale or\ndisposal proposed, the voting trust agreement provides that the trustee must take all actions reasonably requested by merger holdco (including, without\nlimitation, exercising all voting rights in respect of the trust stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or desirable to effect, or consistent with the\neffectuation of, such sale or disposition by merger holdco). The voting trust agreement provides that, in the event the STB final approval is granted, or in\nthe event that the law is amended to allow CPRL or its affiliates to acquire control of KCS without obtaining STB final approval or other governmental\napproval (and upon delivery of an opinion of independent counsel selected by the STB that no order of the STB or other governmental authority is\nrequired), the trustee will transfer the trust stock to or upon the order of merger holdco, as registered holder of the trust certificates, and the voting trust\nshall terminate.\nThe voting trust agreement provides that, in the event that there has been an STB denial, CPRL will use its reasonable best efforts to, directly or\nindirectly, (i) sell the trust stock to one or more eligible purchasers, or (ii) otherwise dispose of the trust stock, during a period of two years after such STB\ndenial or such extension of the two-year period as the STB may approve. Any such disposition will be subject to the jurisdiction of the STB to oversee\nCPRL\u2019s direct or indirect divestiture of the trust stock. In connection with such an event, the trustee would continue to perform its duties under the\nvoting trust agreement and, if CPRL fails to so sell or distribute the trust stock during such period, the trustee will as soon as practicable sell the trust\nstock for cash to one or\n169Table of Contents\nmore eligible purchasers in such manner and for such price as the trustee in its discretion deems reasonable after consultation with CPRL. For purposes\nof the voting trust agreement, an \u201celigible purchaser\u201d is a person or entity not affiliated with CPRL and that has all necessary regulatory authority, if any,\nto purchase the trust stock. CPRL must cooperate with the trustee in so disposing of the trust stock and the trustee must act in accordance with any\ndirection made by CPRL as to any specific terms or method of disposition, to the extent not inconsistent with the requirements of the terms of any STB or\ncourt order. The proceeds of the sale or other disposition would be distributed to merger holdco (or, if applicable, one or more other wholly owned\nsubsidiaries of CPRL), as registered holder(s) of the trust certificates.\nThe voting trust agreement provides that the trustee will receive reasonable and customary compensation for all services rendered under the voting trust\nagreement and will be indemnified by CPRL.\nNeither the trustee nor any affiliate of the trustee may have (i) any officers, or members of their respective boards or directors, in common with CPRL or\nany of its affiliates, or (ii) any direct or indirect business arrangements or dealings, financial or otherwise, with CPRL or any of its affiliates, other than\ndealings pertaining to establishment and carrying out of the trust. During the term of the trust, the trustee will not own any stock or securities of CPRL or\nany of its affiliates\u037e provided that, the trustee may own interests in any independently managed diversified mutual fund that owns stock or securities of\nCPRL and/or any of its affiliates. Neither CPRL nor its affiliates may purchase the stock or securities of the trustee or any affiliate of the trustee.\nSubject to applicable law and to the rules, regulations and practices of the STB, until the voting trust agreement is executed, CPRL may amend the terms\nthereof in its sole discretion\u037e provided that (x) prior to the completion of the post-closing contributions, as described in the merger agreement, the voting\ntrust agreement may not be modified or amended without the prior written consent of KCS unless such modification or amendment is not inconsistent\nwith the merger agreement, is not adverse to KCS and its stockholders and would not reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on\nreceipt of the STB voting trust approval\u037e (y) the voting trust agreement may not be modified or amended without the prior written consent of KCS if such\nmodification or amendment would reasonably be expected to materially increase the liability exposure of the board of directors of the second surviving\ncorporation under applicable law\u037e and (z) any modification to the Voting Trust Agreement would be submitted to the STB for review and approval and the\nSTB would have authority to compel amendment of the Voting Trust Agreement or compliance by the Trustee with any divestiture order or other\ndirective. Following the execution of the voting trust agreement, the voting trust agreement may only be modified or amended by agreement executed by\nthe trustee, CPRL, merger holdco and any other registered holder(s) of the trust certificates (a) pursuant to an order of the STB, (b) with the prior approval\nof the STB, (c) in order to comply with any order of the STB, or (d) upon receipt of an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the trustee and the registered\nholder(s) of trust certificates that an order of the STB approving such modification or amendment is not required and that the amendment is authorized\nunder the merger agreement and is consistent with the regulations of the STB regarding voting trusts.\nOn May 6, 2021, the STB issued a decision indicating that it had conducted a full review of the voting trust submitted to the STB Staff in March 2021 and\ngranted approval for the use of the voting trust to consummate the transaction, subject to the condition that the voting trust agreement be modified to\nprohibit the trustee from owning securities of CPRL or its affiliates during the existence of the voting trust. CPRL made the requisite modification. The\nvoting trust agreement proposed for use with the transaction is unchanged from that modified in respect to the STB\u2019s May 6 decision.\nOn September 15, 2021, CPRL and KCS filed with the STB an Amended Notice of Intent indicating that they had entered a new agreement providing for\nCPRL\u2019s acquisition of KCS, that they would file an application seeking STB control approval on or shortly after October 20, 2021 and that CPRL intended\nto indirectly acquire the shares of KCS prior to receiving control approval via the use of a voting trust that was substantially identical to that reviewed\nand approved by the STB in its May 6 decision.\nOn September 30, 2021, the STB issued a decision confirming that the transaction described in the September 15 Amended Notice of Intent was the \u201csame\ntransaction\u201d that had been noticed in March 2021 and that the STB\u2019s May 6, 2021 approval for CPRL\u2019s proposed use of a voting trust to acquire KCS\napplies to the voting trust proposed for use with the transaction agreed to on September 15.\nFor more information, see \u201cThe KCS Merger Proposal\u2014Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction,\u201d on page 110.\n170\nTable of Contents\nUNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION",

            "text": "UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOn September 15, 2021, CPRL, surviving merger sub and first merger sub entered into the merger agreement with KCS. Following the satisfaction or\nwaiver of the conditions to CPRL\u2019s and KCS\u2019s obligations to effect the transaction, including obtaining CPRL shareholder approval and KCS stockholder\napproval and certain other regulatory approvals, (1) first merger sub will merge with and into KCS with KCS surviving the first merger as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of surviving merger sub, and (2) immediately following the effective time, KCS will merge with and into surviving merger sub with surviving\nmerger sub surviving the second merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of CPRL (together referred to as the \u201ctransaction\u201d). Immediately following\nthe second merger and the post-closing contributions, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of surviving merger sub, as successor to KCS, will be\ndeposited by merger holdco into the voting trust subject to the voting trust agreement, pending STB final approval.\nFollowing the transaction, once STB final approval and approval from other applicable regulatory authorities is obtained, CPRL (through its wholly\nowned subsidiary, merger holdco), would be permitted to acquire control of KCS, the voting trust would be terminated and CPRL (through merger holdco)\nwould acquire control over KCS\u2019s railroad operations (which we refer to, together with the transaction, for purposes of the pro forma financial information\n(as defined below), as the \u201cacquisition\u201d). Following the acquisition, the combined entity will be named Canadian Pacific Kansas City (\u201cCPKC\u201d).\nUnder the merger agreement, CPRL has agreed to pay, on behalf of surviving merger sub (i) holders of KCS common stock issued and outstanding as of\nimmediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) an amount per share equal to the cash\nconsideration of US$90 in cash, without interest, and the share consideration of 2.884 CPRL common shares and (ii) holders of KCS preferred stock\nissued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) an amount\nper share equal to the preferred merger consideration of US$37.50 in cash, without interest. The total purchase consideration, including the merger\nconsideration and preferred merger consideration, to be paid in the transaction by or on behalf of surviving merger sub, and including the amounts\nremitted by and on behalf of CPRL in respect of the CN agreement termination payment and CN refund is estimated to be C$35.3 billion, based on the\nCPRL common share price of US$71.62 and the U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate at October 14, 2021 of 1.2372. An increase (decrease) of 10% in\nthe price of CPRL common shares would cause a C$2,340 million increase (decrease) in the estimated value of the merger consideration, and\ncorrespondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill and intangible assets. A five-cent increase/(decrease) in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar\nwould cause a C$409 million increase/(decrease) in the estimated value of the cash consideration, and correspondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill\nand intangible assets.\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 combine the historical consolidated statements of income of CPRL and KCS, after giving effect to the acquisition and other\nadjustments (as defined below) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2021 combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of CPRL and KCS, after giving effect to the acquisition and other adjustments as\nif they had occurred on September 30, 2021. We refer to these Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Unaudited Pro\nForma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as the \u201cpro forma financial information.\u201d\nAdjustments in the pro forma condensed consolidated financial information to align KCS\u2019s income statement and balance sheet amounts to CPRL\u2019s\npresentation, CPRL\u2019s and KCS\u2019s transaction and related financing costs incurred and expected to be incurred, and the associated income tax impacts of\nrecognizing these costs are defined here as \u201cother adjustments\u201d. For the purposes of the pro forma financial information, all CP and KCS transaction and\nrelated financing costs incurred, or to be incurred, to effect the acquisition, have been included in other adjustments on the basis that all such costs are\nincurred to achieve the final acquisition as defined above.\n171Table of Contents\nThe pro forma financial information has been prepared for illustrative and informational purposes only in accordance with Regulation S-X Article 11, \u201cpro\nforma financial information\u201d and applicable Canadian securities laws to illustrate the estimated effects of the acquisition and certain other related\ntransactions and adjustments described below (collectively, \u201cadjustments\u201d or \u201ctransaction accounting adjustments\u201d). The pro forma financial information\nis based on various adjustments and assumptions and is not necessarily indicative of what CPKC\u2019s consolidated statement of income or consolidated\nbalance sheet actually would have been had the acquisition and other adjustments been completed as of the dates indicated or will be for any future\nperiods. The pro forma financial information does not purport to project the future financial position or operating results of CPKC following the\ncompletion of the acquisition. The pro forma financial information does not include adjustments to reflect any potential revenue or operational synergies\nor cost savings that may be achievable in connection with the acquisition. The pro forma financial information does not reflect any divestitures or any\nother actions that may be required by regulatory or governmental authorities in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances for the\ntransaction.\nThe pro forma financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP, with CPRL being the accounting\nacquirer in the acquisition. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and will be different from the adjustments based on final acquisition accounting\nwhen completed, and the differences could be material.\nFollowing the closing date, and until STB final approval is obtained and CPRL (through merger holdco) acquires control of KCS, CPRL expects to account\nfor its 100% indirect equity ownership investment in KCS using the equity method of accounting. The pro forma financial information has been prepared\non the assumption that CPRL (through merger holdco) has assumed control of KCS as the ultimate outcome of the acquisition will be a business\ncombination of CPRL and KCS.\nThe pro forma financial information reflects pro forma adjustments CPRL believes are necessary to present fairly CPKC\u2019s pro forma results of income and\nfinancial position following the completion of the acquisition as of and for the periods indicated. The pro forma adjustments are based on currently\navailable information and assumptions CPRL believes are, under the circumstances and given the information available at this time, reasonable, directly\nattributable to the acquisition, and reflective of adjustments necessary to report CPKC\u2019s financial condition and results of operations as if CPRL\ncompleted the acquisition.\n172\nTable of Contents\nUNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET",

            "text": "NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCANADIAN PACIFIC KANSAS CITY\n(currently Canadian Pacific Railway Limited)\nNotes to Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information (unaudited)\nAs at and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020\n1.\nBasis of presentation:\nOn September 15, 2021, CPRL, surviving merger sub and first merger sub entered into the merger agreement with KCS. Following the satisfaction or\nwaiver of the conditions to CPRL\u2019s and KCS\u2019s obligations to effect the transaction, including obtaining the CPRL shareholder approval and KCS\nstockholder approval and certain other regulatory approvals, (1) first merger sub will merge with and into KCS with KCS surviving the first merger\nas a wholly owned subsidiary of surviving merger sub, and (2) immediately following the effective time, KCS will merge with and into surviving\nmerger sub with surviving merger sub surviving the second merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of CPRL. Immediately following the second\nmerger and the post-closing contributions, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of surviving merger sub, as successor to KCS, will be\ndeposited by merger holdco into the voting trust subject to the voting trust agreement, pending STB final approval. Following the transaction, and\nonce STB final approval and approval from other applicable regulatory authorities is obtained, CPRL (through its wholly owned subsidiary, merger\nholdco), would be permitted to acquire control of KCS. The voting trust would be terminated and CPRL (through merger holdco) would then\nacquire control over KCS\u2019s railroad operations. Following the acquisition, the combined entity will be named Canadian Pacific Kansas City.\nUnder the merger agreement, CPRL has agreed to pay, on behalf of surviving merger sub (i) holders of KCS common stock issued and outstanding\nas of immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) an amount per share equal to\nthe cash consideration of US$90.00 in cash, without interest, and the share consideration of 2.884 CPRL common shares and (ii) holders of KCS\npreferred stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger\nagreement) an amount per share equal to US$37.50 in cash, without interest. The total purchase consideration to be paid in the transaction is\nestimated to be C$35.3 billion, based on the CPRL common share price of US$71.62 and the U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate at October\n14, 2021 of 1.2372. An increase (decrease) of 10% in the price of CPRL common shares would cause a C$2,340 million increase (decrease) in the\nestimated value of the total consideration, and correspondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill and intangible assets. A five-cent increase\n(decrease) in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar would cause a C$409 million increase (decrease) in the estimated value of the cash\nconsideration, and correspondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill and intangible assets.\nUnder the merger agreement, at the effective time, (1) each option to purchase shares of KCS common stock, whether vested or unvested, that is\noutstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive an\namount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (a) the merger consideration value over (b) the exercise price per share of KCS common stock of\nsuch option multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of KCS common stock subject to such option as of immediately prior to the effective time,\nless applicable tax withholding (if any) with respect to the payment of such cash\u037e (2) each award of shares of KCS common stock granted subject to\nany vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time and was granted prior to March 21,\n2021, will, at the effective time, be converted into the right to receive (i) the merger consideration in respect of each share of KCS common stock\nsubject to such KCS restricted share award as of immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) the accrued but unpaid cash dividends\ncorresponding to each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award, less applicable tax withholding (if any) with respect\nto the payment of such merger consideration or cash\u037e\n176Table of Contents\n(3) each award of shares of KCS common stock granted subject to any vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions that is outstanding as of\nimmediately prior to the effective time and was granted on or after March 21, 2021, will, at the effective time, be converted into an award that entitles\nthe holder to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration value in respect of each share of KCS common stock subject to such\nKCS restricted share award and (ii) the accrued but unpaid cash dividends corresponding to each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS\nrestricted share award (where each such cash-based award described in this clause (3) will have the same terms and conditions (including vesting\nterms and conditions) as applied to the corresponding KCS restricted share award, except that such award will vest in full upon a qualifying\ntermination)\u037e and (4) each award of performance shares that corresponds to shares of KCS common stock that is outstanding as of immediately\nprior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be converted into an award that entitles the holder thereof, upon vesting, to receive an amount\nin cash equal to the merger consideration value in respect of each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS performance share award, with\nthe number of shares of KCS common stock subject to each such award equal to 200% of the target number of shares of KCS common stock\ncovered by each such award as of immediately prior to the effective time.\nCPRL and CPRC have arranged a commitment for a bridge facility on the terms set out in the debt commitment letters that, if needed, will be\navailable to CPRC, through surviving merger sub, to fund the cash consideration payable to the KCS stockholders. The floating interest rate on the\nbridge facility is assumed to be 4.5% and, if drawn, the facility will mature 364 days post closing of the transaction. CPRL anticipates CPRC issuing\na series of term notes with varying maturity dates that ultimately will be used to fund the cash consideration.\nThe Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information (the \u201cpro forma financial information\u201d) has been prepared for inclusion in\nthe proxy statement/prospectus which forms a part of the registration statement filed on Form F-4 with respect to CPRL\u2019s common shares to be\nissued in the transaction.\nThe pro forma financial information has been prepared from:\n\u2022\nThe Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of CPRL as at and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included in CPRL\u2019s\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nThe Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of KCS as at and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included in KCS\u2019s\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of CPRL as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 as included in CPRL\u2019s Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of KCS as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 as included in KCS\u2019s Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nUpon the closing, and only for the period that the outstanding shares of the capital stock of the second surviving corporation (as successor to\nKCS) are held in the voting trust, CPRL will account for its 100% indirect equity ownership of the second surviving corporation using the equity\nmethod of accounting. Once the STB has completed its review of the transaction and approved CPRL\u2019s acquisition of control of KCS, CPRL will\nconsolidate KCS prospectively and CPRL will remeasure the equity method investment to fair value immediately before KCS is consolidated, with\nany resulting gain or loss recognized in net income. As the ultimate outcome of the transaction, assuming receipt of STB final approval, will be a\nbusiness\n177\nTable of Contents\ncombination, the unaudited pro forma financial information presented in this proxy statement/prospectus has been prepared on the basis of a\nbusiness combination beginning at the assumed effective time of the transaction.\nThe pro forma financial information includes all adjustments necessary to be consistent with U.S. GAAP and in accordance with Regulation S-X\nArticle 11. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (the \u201cpro forma balance sheet\u201d) gives effect to the acquisition as if it\nhad occurred on September 30, 2021. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020 (collectively, the \u201cpro forma statements of income\u201d) give effect to the acquisition as if it\noccurred on January 1, 2020.\nThe pro forma financial information does not include adjustments to reflect any potential revenue or operational synergies or cost savings that may\nbe achievable in connection with the transaction contemplated therein.\nThe pro forma financial information may not be indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the events reflected therein had been\nin effect on the dates indicated or of the results that may be obtained in the future. The pro forma financial information should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements of CPRL and KCS referred to above.\n2.\nPrinciples of consolidation:\nThe pro forma financial information has been prepared on the basis that CPRL will account for the acquisition as a purchase of KCS using the\nacquisition method pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 805 \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d). Under the acquisition method,\nassets and liabilities of KCS are recorded at their fair value on the date of the acquisition and the total consideration is allocated to the tangible and\nintangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nThe adjustments to the pro forma financial information are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of presenting the pro forma\nfinancial information, which are necessary to comply with applicable disclosure and reporting requirements. The allocation of the estimated\nconsideration is pending finalization of various estimates, inputs and analyses. Since this pro forma financial information has been prepared based\non preliminary estimates of consideration and fair values attributable to the purchase of KCS, the actual amounts eventually recorded for the\npurchase accounting, including the identifiable intangibles and goodwill, may differ materially from the information presented. Refer to note 4.\n3.\nPresentation currency:\nCPRL\u2019s consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars whilst the consolidated financial statements of KCS are presented in\nU.S. dollars. For purposes of the pro forma financial information, the balance sheet of KCS has been translated to Canadian dollars at the September\n30, 2021 foreign exchange rate and the statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021\nhave been translated to Canadian dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the respective periods.\n178\nTable of

shares as of October 14, 2021, with such date being a date reasonably in proximity to the date of preparation of the pro forma financial\ninformation. The final purchase price equation will be based on the closing price of CPRL common shares on the date the transaction is completed.\n183\nTable of Contents\nThe number of issued and outstanding shares of KCS common stock was based on the shares outstanding at September 30, 2021 being 90,789,609\nshares of KCS common stock and 214,542 shares of KCS preferred stock.\nAs part of the transaction, the outstanding KCS equity awards are settled in cash and stock. The preliminary purchase price equation is based on\nan estimated payment to holders of the KCS equity awards of approximately C$240 million, net of the proceeds on the exercise of KCS stock\noptions (note 1).\nAn increase (decrease) of 10% in the price of CPRL common shares would cause a C$2,340 million increase (decrease) in the estimated value of the\ntotal consideration, and correspondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill and intangible assets. A five-cent increase (decrease) in the Canadian\ndollar relative to the U.S. dollar would cause a C$409 million increase (decrease) in the estimated value of the cash consideration, and\ncorrespondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill and intangible assets.\nb)\nFair value of non controlling interest\nAs of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the fair value of the interest held by others in Meridian Speedway LLC cannot be reasonably\nestimated and has been currently reflected at the carrying amount. When CPRL has finalized its determination of the fair value of the non\ncontrolling interest, the value ultimately determined could be materially different, with a corresponding impact on the amount of Goodwill and\nintangible assets.\nc)\nOther assets\nThe value of the right of use assets, which is included in this financial statement caption, is reduced by C$1 million to equal the remaining lease\nliability relating to these assets, in accordance with the requirements of ASC 805. In addition, goodwill included in the accounts of KCS of C$17\nmillion, which is reported in this caption, is eliminated.\nd)\nKCS transaction costs\nEstimated transaction costs of C$149 million expected to be incurred by KCS have been added to Accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The\nestimated transaction costs are preliminary and may change.\ne)\nLong-term debt\nThe change in value of Long-term debt reflects the adjustment to record the debt at its estimated fair value.\nf)\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nAt the date of preparation of this pro forma financial information, certain fair value adjustments have been made as identified above\u037e however, the\nfair values of KCS\u2019s identifiable assets and liabilities assumed and the impact of applying acquisition accounting have not been fully determined.\nAfter reflecting the fair value adjustments made herein, the excess of the total consideration over the recognized amounts has been presented in\nGoodwill and intangible assets at C$30,349 million. Once detailed valuations and related calculations are completed, a material portion of this\namount could be attributable to Properties, Goodwill and intangible assets, Other assets, Other long-term liabilities, and the related Deferred income\ntax balances.\ng)\nHistorical shareholders\u2019 equity\nThe historical shareholders\u2019 equity will be eliminated as part of the acquisition.\n184\nTable of Contents\nh)\nIncome taxes\nThe adjustment to income tax relates to the deferred tax impact of the pro forma adjustments to the balance sheet as a result of the preliminary\npurchase price calculation. The adjustment to income tax is calculated at an estimated effective rate of approximately 21% for 2021, and mainly\nrelates to the fair value adjustment for long-term debt (see note 4(e)) and the elimination of the tax impact of the CN agreement termination payment\n(see note 4(i)).\ni)\nTermination payments and reimbursements\nThe CN agreement termination payment and CN refund paid by CPRL to KCS in respect of KCS\u2019s termination payments to CN (or an affiliate of CN)\ntotaling US$1,400 million (C$1,773 million) have been reflected as part of the consideration paid to acquire KCS (\u201cthe CN termination payments\u201d).\nIncluded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of KCS is US$700 million (C$892 million) related to these payments. This amount is not\nreflected in the liabilities assumed in the acquisition as it has been reflected as a cost of the acquisition.\n5.\nOther transaction accounting adjustments:\nExplanations of the other transaction accounting adjustments to the pro forma financial information are as follows:\na)\nReclassification adjustments\nCertain reclassification adjustments have been made to the pro forma financial information to make the presentation conform to the presentation\nadopted by CPRL. At this time, CPRL is not aware of any material differences in accounting policies that would have a material impact on the pro\nforma financial information. Following the acquisition, CPRL will conduct a review of KCS\u2019s accounting policies in an effort to determine if there are\nany additional material differences that require reclassification of KCS\u2019s revenues, expenses, assets or liabilities to conform to CPRL\u2019s accounting\npolicies and classifications. As a result of that review, CPRL may identify differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that,\nwhen conformed, could have a material impact on the pro forma financial information.\nThe following reclassification adjustments have been made in the pro forma financial information:\nPro forma balance sheet\n\u2022\nRevised presentation of KCS operating lease right-of-use asset and the related lease liability to classify the amounts into the financial\nstatement captions used by CPRL.\n\u2022\nReclassified a portion of KCS\u2019s \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d to Pension and other benefits liabilities to classify the amounts into the\nfinancial statement captions used by CPRL.\nPro forma statements of income\n\u2022\nCPRL has aggregated its revenue into a single financial statement caption for purpose of the condensed presentation used in the pro\nforma statements of income.\n\u2022\nCPRL includes foreign exchange (gain) loss in the financial statement caption titled other (income) expense. The foreign exchange\n(gain) loss incurred by KCS has been reclassified into this caption.\n185\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nCPRL includes equity in net (earnings) losses from affiliates in the financial statement caption titled other (income) expense. KCS\u2019s\nequity in net (earnings) losses from affiliates has been reclassified into this caption.\n\u2022\nCPRL does not include impairment or the write-off of software costs as a separate financial statement caption in the income statement.\nThe write-off of software development costs incurred by KCS has been reclassified into Purchased services and other expenses.\n\u2022\nCPRL does not present restructuring costs on a separate financial statement caption in the income statement. The lease-related\nrestructuring costs incurred by KCS have been reclassified into Equipment rents and the compensation-related restructuring costs\nhave been reclassified into Compensation and benefits.\n\u2022\nCPRL does not present a financial statement caption representing materials and other and amounts classified in this caption by KCS\nhave been reclassified into Materials and Purchased services and other.\nb)\nTransaction costs\nAt September 30, 2021, C$147 million of transaction costs were recognized in Purchased services and other by CPRL and its affiliates and C$96\nmillion were recognized as Merger costs by KCS. These have subsequently been removed from the pro forma statement of income for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 and the amount of transaction costs incurred and expected to be incurred by CPRL and its affiliates of C$181\nmillion and by KCS of C$243 million, throughout the various stages of the acquisition, have been recognized in the pro forma statement of income\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020 in Purchased services and other. This is to reflect the acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.\nCPRL\u2019s Other expense (income) financial statement caption for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 includes C$295 million of which C$248\nmillion related to changes in the fair value on foreign exchange forward contracts, bond locks and forward starting floating-to-fix interest rate swaps\nassociated with the anticipated acquisition of KCS and C$47 million related to bridge financing fees associated with the anticipated funding of KCS.\nThis amount and the associated deferred tax impact, have been removed from the statement of income for the nine months ended September 30,\n2021 and reflected in 2020 along with additional amounts of C$4 million expected to be incurred by CPRL, as the pro forma statements of income\nreflect the acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.\nAdditionally, the pro forma balance sheet as at September 30, 2021 has been adjusted to include transaction costs expected to be incurred as at that\ndate of C$38 million by CPRL and C$149 million by KCS, as discussed above.\nIncluded in KCS\u2019s Merger costs for the nine month period ended September 30, 2021, is the C$876 million (US$700 million) CN agreement\ntermination payment made to CN. This amount has been eliminated from the pro forma statement of income for the nine months ended September\n30, 2021.\nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2021, CPRL recorded a non-recurring, merger termination payment of C$845 million (US$700 million)\nreceived in relation to the termination of the first merger agreement with KCS (i.e., the CP termination payment). This merger termination payment,\nalong with the associated current tax impact, has been removed from the pro forma statement of income for the nine months ended September 30,\n2021 and has been reflected in the pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as the pro forma statements of income\nreflect the acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.\n186\nTable of Contents\nThe CN termination payments have been included as a cost of the acquisition (note 4 (i)).\nThe estimated transaction costs and tax deductibility are preliminary, may change and are non-recurring adjustments.\nc)\nDebt and finance expenses\nPart of the consideration associated with the acquisition of KCS is the CN termination payments of US$1,400 million (approximately C$1,773 million\nbased on the US to Canadian dollar exchange rate as of the date that the termination payments were made). A portion of the termination payments\ntotalling US$400 million (C$506 million) were funded by existing cash resources with the remaining balance of US$1,000 million (C$1,267 million)\nfunded by short-term borrowings including commercial paper and a short-term loan facility that was established by CPRC and CPRL. The average\ncost of such short-term borrowings is approximately 1%. Interest costs related to these facilities has been included in the pro forma statements of\nincome based on the assumption that CPRC and CPRL will continue to finance a portion of the CN termination payments through its short-term\nborrowing facilities. Interest expense includes C$9 million and C$13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively, associated with these borrowings.\nCPRL and CPRC have arranged a commitment for a bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of US$8.5 billion on the terms set out in the debt\ncommitment letters that, if needed, will be available to CPRC, through surviving merger sub, to fund the cash consideration payable to the KCS\nstockholders for the preferred stock and the common stock, the cash settlement for the stock based compensation awards and approximately C$250\nmillion of transaction costs associated with the transaction. The pro forma balance sheet includes an amount of C$10,516 million assumed to be\nborrowed under this facility for these purposes. The floating interest rate on the bridge facility is assumed to be 4.5% and if drawn, the facility will\nmature 364 days after closing of the transaction. Interest costs related to this facility have been included in the pro forma statements of income\nbased on the assumption that CPRC and CPRL will continue to finance the remaining cash consideration through the bridge facility for its full term.\nNet interest expense includes C$355 million and C$473 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020,\nrespectively, associated with these borrowings.\nBridge facility fees expensed through Other (income) and expense associated with the bridge facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2021\nof C$47 million have been removed in the pro forma statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the expected total\nexpense of C$51 million has been recorded as an Other (income) expense in the pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31,\n2020.\nCPRL anticipates CPRC issuing a series of term notes with varying maturity dates that ultimately will be used, by surviving merger sub, to fund the\ncash consideration. It is currently expected that term notes will be issued prior to consummating the transaction such that the bridge facility will not\nbe drawn. The impact of a 220 basis point (2.2%) increase (decrease) in the rate of borrowing, relating to funds drawn under the bridge facility,\nwould increase (decrease) interest expense by approximately C$231 million per annum.\nThe debt assumed upon the acquisition of KCS is recorded in the purchase equation at fair value. The change in fair value is amortized into Net\ninterest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt instrument using the effective interest rate method. As a result, adjustments of\nC$38 million and C$54 million have been recorded as a reduction of Net interest expense in the pro forma statements of income for the nine months\nended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively.\n187\nTable of Contents\nUpon the closing of the transaction, it is presumed that CP has designated all incremental U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings as a foreign currency\nhedge of its net investment in foreign operations. Accordingly, foreign exchange gains and losses, from the dates of designation, on the translation\nof the U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings would be included in Other comprehensive income (loss).\nd)\nIncome taxes\nThe adjustment to income tax relates to the deferred tax impact of certain pro forma adjustments to the statement of income calculated at a KCS\nstatutory rate of 21% for 2020 and 2021 for KCS related adjustments and a CP statutory rate of 26% for 2020 and 2021 for CP related adjustments.\nThe tax treatment of the pro forma adjustments is preliminary and may change.\ne)\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nThe excess of the total purchase consideration over the recognized amounts of net assets has been presented as Goodwill and intangible assets in\nthe pro forma balance sheet. No depreciation or amortization has been recorded in relation to this amount and the determination of the amount that\nwill be associated with depreciable and amortizable assets is not yet known. For every $1 billion recorded as depreciable and amortizable assets,\nCPRL\u2019s annual depreciation and amortization expense would increase by C$30 million, assuming a 3% depreciation and amortization rate. The\ndepreciation and amortization rate of 3% approximates CPRL\u2019s estimated annual rate of depreciation and amortization. See the section entitled \u2013\n\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 37.\nf)\nPost-transaction compensation adjustments\nThe pro forma statement of income includes various adjustments to Compensation and benefits expense as summarized in the table noted below.\n(in millions of Canadian dollars)\nNine\nmonths\nended\nSeptember\n30,\n2021\nYear\nended\nDecember\n31,\n2020\nShare-based compensation (i)\n$\n6\n$\n34\nCash-based retention payments (ii)\n\u2014\n67\nShare-based retention payments (iii)\n1\n4\nOther (iv)\n\u2014\n1\n1\nTotal\n$\n7\n$\n116\nAmounts related to cash-based retention payments, share-based retention payments and other payments, of C$69 million are shown as an increase\nto Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the pro forma balance sheet.\ni) Share-based compensation\nThe vesting of certain share-based compensation arrangements of KCS are accelerated upon occurrence of the transaction. Share-based\narrangements that vest upon the closing of the transaction are reflected as part of the transaction\u2019s purchase price (note 4).\nUnvested KCS performance share awards will be converted into a cash-based award that entitles the holder thereof, upon vesting at the end of the\nthree-year requisite service period, to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration value for each performance share award held\nmultiplied by a performance factor of 200%. The fair value of the KCS\u2019s performance share awards attributable to pre-transaction service that\n188\nTable of Contents\nwill be assumed by CPRL as at the closing date is estimated at C$43 million, and forms part of the consideration paid by CPRL to acquire KCS. This\namount is included within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and in Other long-term liabilities on the pro forma balance sheet. The\ncompensation cost attributed to post-transaction services resulted in an adjustment to Compensation and benefits expense of C$6 million and C$34\nmillion reflected in the pro forma statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\nii) Cash-based retention payments\nKCS has established a cash-based retention program for KCS employees. Each award granted pursuant to the retention program will vest and\nbecome payable in two installments: (1) 25% on the earlier of (a) the date on which the closing date occurs and (b) February 21, 2022, and (2) 75%\non the earlier of (a) ninety (90) days after the date that CPRL acquires control of KCS and (b) June 1, 2023, subject, in each case, to the recipient\u2019s\ncontinued employment through the applicable vesting dates\u037e provided, however, that if the recipient experiences a qualifying termination, then the\nrecipient will be entitled to any then unpaid portion of the recipient\u2019s award.\nThe pro forma financial information gives effect to the acquisition of control of KCS, for income statement purposes, on January 1, 2020, as such,\nthe maximum amount payable under this retention program of C$67 million has been recorded in Compensation and benefits expenses for the year\nended December 31, 2020.\niii) Share-based retention payments\nKCS has established a restricted share-based retention program whereby employees and officers have received 17,934 KCS restricted share awards\nwith a vesting period of not less than one year. In connection with the transaction, the unvested KCS restricted share awards will be converted into\na right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration value in respect of each restricted share award, and (ii) the accrued but\nunpaid cash dividends corresponding to each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award, upon vesting. The pro\nforma adjustment to Compensation and benefits expenses includes C$1 million and C$4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and\nthe year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, associated with this retention program.\niv) Other compensation adjustment\nPursuant to the transaction, KCS employees who participate in the KCS annual bonus are eligible for an additional bonus payment that is based on\nthe achievement of the applicable performance goals at the greater of (1) target performance and (2) 130% of actual performance, but in no event\ngreater than 200% of target. An adjustment of C$11 million is reflected within Compensation and benefits expenses in the statement of income for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 representing the incremental bonus that would have been recorded had the adjustment been reflected in the\nannual bonus plan for the 2020 calendar year. This adjustment will not recur in the statement of income beyond twelve months after the transaction.\ng)\nCost savings and synergies\nThe pro forma financial information does not include adjustments to reflect any potential revenue synergies or cost savings that may be achievable\nin connection with the acquisition.\n189\nTable of Contents\n6.\nPro forma earnings per share:\nThe earnings per common share has been based on the following:\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2021\n(millions of shares)\nBasic\nDiluted\nCPRL\u2019s weighted average common shares outstanding for the period\n666.7\n669.8\nCPRL common shares issued upon the closing of the transaction\n262.4\n262.4\nPro forma weighted average number of common shares outstanding\n929.1\n932.2\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020\n(millions of shares)\nBasic\nDiluted\nCPRL\u2019s weighted average common shares outstanding for the period\n677.2\n679.9\nCPRL common shares issued upon the closing of the transaction\n262.4\n262.4\nPro forma weighted average number of common shares outstanding\n939.6\n942.3\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the number of basic and diluted CPRL common shares has been adjusted to give effect to the 5 for 1 share\nsplit that occurred in the second quarter of 2021.\n190\nTable of Contents\nBENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES",

CPRL\u2019s\narticles do not provide for cumulative voting.\nKCS\u2019s certificate of incorporation does not provide for\ncumulative voting.\nVacancies\nThe CBCA generally allows a vacancy on the board of\ndirectors to be filled by a quorum of directors, except a\nvacancy resulting from an increase in the number or the\nminimum or maximum number of directors or a failure to elect\nthe number or minimum number of directors provided for in\nthe articles. Any vacancy among the directors resulting from\nan increase in the number of directors as so determined may\nbe filled by resolution of the directors.\nThe KCS board has the power to fill all vacancies and\nnewly created directorships by a majority of the directors\nthen in office.\nVotes to Govern\nAt all meetings of the CPRL board, every question must be\ndecided by a majority of the votes cast.

The directors have a duty to manage,\nor supervise the management of, the business and affairs of\nCPRL. In exercising their powers and discharging their\nduties, the directors must: (i) act honestly and in good faith\nwith a view to the best interests of CPRL\u037e and (ii) exercise the\ncare, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person\nwould exercise in comparable circumstances. When acting\nwith a view to the best interests of CPRL, the directors\nUnder Delaware law, the directors of KCS owe a duty of\ncare and a duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that\ndirectors act on an informed basis after due consideration\nof the relevant materials and appropriate deliberation. The\nduty of care also requires that directors exercise care in\noverseeing and investigating the conduct of corporate\nemployees.

Canadian courts will scrutinize the\nprocess by which the directors make their decisions and the\napparent objectives of their actions. If business decisions\nhave been made honestly, prudently, in good faith, on\nreasonable grounds, and on an individual basis, Canadian\ncourts will generally decline to substitute their own opinion\nfor that of the board of directors, even where subsequent\nevents may cast doubt on the directors\u2019 determination.\nUnder the CBCA, the directors of CPRL may delegate their\nduties to a managing director who is a resident Canadian or\ncommittee of directors and delegate to such managing\ndirector or committee any of the powers of the directors, or to\nan officer of CPRL\u037e

complying\nwith its disclosure obligations under applicable Law or rules and policies of the NYSE, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position\ncontemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule

The Trustee shall take\nall actions reasonably requested by Holdco with respect to (including, without limitation, exercising all voting rights in respect of Trust Stock in favor of\nany proposal or action necessary or desirable to effect, or consistent with the effectuation of) any proposed direct or indirect sale or other disposition of\nthe whole or any part of the Trust Stock by Holdco. The Trustee shall at any time upon the receipt of a direction from Parent signed by its President and\nChief Executive Officer or one of its authorized officers designating the person or entity to whom Parent has directly or indirectly sold or otherwise\ndisposed of the whole or any part of the Trust Stock and certifying that such person or entity is not an affiliate of Parent and has all necessary regulatory\nauthority, if any be required, to purchase the Trust Stock (upon which certification the Trustee shall be entitled to rely), immediately transfer to the person\nor entity therein named all the Trustee\u2019s right, title and interest in such amount of the Trust Stock as may be set forth in said direction. If any regulatory\nauthority or approval, including STB approval, is required for such transfer, Parent will not give any such direction unless and until such regulatory\nauthority or approval is obtained. If the foregoing direction shall specify all of the Trust Stock, then following transfer of the Trustee\u2019s right, title and\ninterest therein, and in the event of a sale thereof, upon delivery to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of the Trust Certificates of the proceeds\nof such sale, this Trust shall cease and come to an end. If the foregoing direction is as to only a part of the Trust Stock, then this Trust shall cease as to\nsaid part upon such transfer, and distribution of the net proceeds therefrom in the event of sale, but shall remain in full force and effect as to the\nremaining part of the Trust Stock. In the event of a direct or indirect sale of Trust Stock by Parent, the Trustee shall, to the extent the consideration\ntherefor is payable to or controllable by the Trustee, promptly pay, or cause to be paid upon the order of Parent the net proceeds of such sale on a pro\nrata basis to the registered holder(s) of the Trust Certificates. It is the intention of this paragraph that no violations of 49 U.S.C. Section 11323 will result\nfrom a termination of this Trust.\n(b) In the event the STB Approval (as defined below) shall have been granted, then immediately upon the direction of Parent and the\ndelivery of a certified copy of such order of the STB or other governmental authority with respect thereof, or, in the event that Subtitle IV of Title 49 of the\nUnited States Code, or other controlling law, is amended to allow Parent or its affiliates to acquire control of the Company without obtaining STB or other\ngovernmental approval, upon delivery of an opinion of independent counsel selected by the Trustee that no order of the STB or other governmental\nauthority is required, the Trustee shall transfer to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates hereunder as then known to the\nTrustee, its right, title and interest in and to all of the Trust Stock then held by it in accordance with the terms, conditions and agreements of this Trust\nAgreement and not theretofore transferred by it as provided in subparagraph (a) hereof, and upon such transfer this Trust shall cease and come to an\nend.\n(c) In the event that there shall have been an STB Denial (as defined below), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, directly or\nindirectly, (i) sell the Trust Stock to one or more eligible purchasers, or (ii) otherwise dispose of the Trust Stock, during a period of two years after such\nSTB Denial or such extension of that period as the STB shall approve. Any such disposition shall be subject to any jurisdiction of the STB to oversee\nParent\u2019s direct or indirect divestiture of Trust Stock. At all times, the Trustee shall continue to perform its duties under this Trust Agreement and, should\nParent be unsuccessful in its efforts to directly or indirectly sell\nA-100\nTable of Contents\nor distribute the Trust Stock during the period referred to, the Trustee shall as soon as practicable sell the Trust Stock for cash to one or more eligible\npurchasers in such manner and for such price as the Trustee in its discretion shall deem reasonable after consultation with the Parent.

Parent agrees to cooperate with the Trustee in effecting such disposition, and the Trustee agrees to act in accordance with\nany direction made by Parent as to any specific terms or method of disposition, to the extent not inconsistent with the requirements of the terms of any\nSTB or court order. The proceeds of the sale shall be distributed on a pro rata basis to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of the Trust\nCertificates hereunder as then known to the Trustee. The Trustee may, in its reasonable discretion, require the surrender to it of the Trust Certificates\nhereunder before paying to the holder its share of the proceeds. Upon disposition of the Trust Stock pursuant to this Paragraph 9(c), this Trust shall\ncease and come to an end.\n(d) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to any other provision herein contained, this Trust Agreement shall terminate on December 31, 2025,\nand may be extended by the Parties hereto, so long as no violation of 49 U.S.C. Sections 11323 will result from such termination or extension.

In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory and/or financing services to the\nCompany, the Buyer and certain of their respective affiliates, and have received fees in connection with such services.
