There will not be a physical meeting\nlocation. In light of continuing public health and travel concerns arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, Zendesk\nbelieves hosting a virtual meeting helps ensure the health and safety of its stockholders, the Board of Directors\nand Zendesk management. Additionally, the virtual nature of the Special Meeting is generally designed to\nenable participation of and access by more Zendesk stockholders while decreasing the cost of conducting the\nSpecial Meeting. \nZendesk stockholders will be able to virtually attend and vote at the Special Meeting by visiting\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ZEN2022SM, which we refer to as the \u201cSpecial Meeting website.\u201d We\nencourage you to access the Special Meeting before it begins. Online check-in will start approximately 15\nminutes before the Special Meeting is scheduled to begin at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on September 19, 2022.\nQ:\nWhat am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nYou are being asked to vote on the following proposals:\n\u2022\nto adopt the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nto approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\nto approve the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nZendesk stockholders as of the Record Date of August 4, 2022 are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and\nto vote at the Special Meeting. Each holder of shares of Zendesk common stock shall be entitled to cast one\nvote on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each such share owned at the close of\nbusiness on the Record Date. Virtual attendance at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website is not\nrequired to vote.\nQ:\nMay I attend and vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nAll Zendesk stockholders as of the Record Date may attend and vote at the Special Meeting.\nShares held directly in your name as a Zendesk stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via\nthe Special Meeting website. Shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special\nMeeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nEven if you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed\nproxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or\nby telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement\n12TABLE OF CONTENTS\nentitled \u201cThe Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d) so that your vote will be counted if you later\ndecide not to or become unable to virtually attend the Special meeting. If you attend the Special Meeting and\nvote thereat, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $77.50 in cash,\nwithout interest, subject to any required tax withholding, for each share of Zendesk common stock that you own\n(other than any Unconverted Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you have properly and\nvalidly exercised and do not withdraw your appraisal rights in accordance with and complied with Section 262 of\nthe DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of Zendesk common stock, you will receive $7,750 in cash in\nexchange for your shares of Zendesk common stock (other than any Unconverted Shares), without interest and\nless any applicable withholding taxes. Unconverted Shares means (a) certain shares of Zendesk common stock\nthat are issued and outstanding and owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or its subsidiaries, including Merger\nSub, or held by Zendesk or its wholly owned subsidiaries, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time,\n(b) shares of Zendesk common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and\nthat are held by holders who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who have\nproperly and validly exercised (and not withdrawn) appraisal rights in accordance with, and who have complied\nwith, Section 262 of the DGCL and (c) shares of Zendesk common stock underlying or comprising unexercised,\nunvested or unsettled or not in-the-money Stock Options (i.e., with per share exercise prices that are equal to or\ngreater than the Merger Consideration (as defined in this section of this proxy statement)) and RSU Awards.\nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?\nA:\nThe exchange of Zendesk common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder who exchanges shares of Zendesk common stock for\ncash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the\namount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the\nshares of Zendesk common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S. Holder.\nWith respect to a non-U.S. Holder, the exchange of Zendesk common stock for cash in the Merger generally will\nnot result in tax to that non-U.S. Holder under United States federal income tax laws unless that non-U.S. Holder\nhas certain connections with the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the non-\nU.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from\nbackup withholding tax.\nThis proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the\nMerger. This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or\nother tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal\ntax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you\nof the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive for my RSU Award and Stock Options in the Merger?\nA:\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time:\n\u2022\nRSU Awards and in-the-money Stock Options that are vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time\n(assuming achievement of performance for performance-based RSU Awards using the same formula\nprovided for in the applicable award agreement) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the\nCash Amount equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Zendesk common stock subject to\nsuch award and (y) the Merger Consideration (and for Stock Options, less the exercise price per share of\nZendesk common stock subject to such Stock Option), less any required tax withholding and deductions.\n\u2022\nStock Options with per share exercise prices that are equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will\nbe canceled for no consideration.\n\u2022\nAny unvested in-the-money Stock Option and any unvested RSU Award will be canceled and converted\ninto a cash award for the Cash Amount (assuming achievement of performance for performance-based\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRSU Awards using the same formula provided for in the applicable award agreement), with such cash\nawards being subject to the same time-vesting terms and conditions that applied to the associated award,\nas applicable (except for performance-based vesting conditions), immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock entitled to\nvote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the\nshares of Zendesk common stock properly cast for the Compensation Proposal is required to approve the\nCompensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of either (a) a majority of the shares of Zendesk common stock\nproperly cast for the Adjournment Proposal, when a quorum is present, or (b) the affirmative vote of the holders\nof the shares of Zendesk common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person or\nrepresented by proxy at the Special Meeting, when a quorum is not present, is required, as applicable, for\napproval of the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any Zendesk stockholder of record to: (a) submit a\nsigned proxy card\u037e (b) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions\ndetailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d)\u037e or\n(c) vote virtually at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement\nProposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the\nAdjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,\nthe failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the\nCompensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,\nabstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a\nquorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Each\n\u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a\nquorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum\nis not present, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment Proposal. If you\nproperly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter,\nthe shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement\nProposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Zendesk stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any\nother reason, Zendesk stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Zendesk common stock.\nInstead, Zendesk will remain an independent public company, Zendesk common stock will continue to be listed\nand traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and Zendesk will continue to file periodic\nreports with the SEC.\nUnder specified circumstances, Zendesk will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $254 million, upon the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Termination Fees.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy are Zendesk stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Compensation\nProposal?\nA:\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Zendesk to seek an advisory (nonbinding) vote\nwith respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with\nthe Merger.\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat will happen if Zendesk stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with\nrespect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Zendesk. Therefore, if the\napproval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable\nunder the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Zendesk\u2019s named executive officers in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,\nincluding the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as\nthey contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign,\ndate and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant\nyour proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d), so that your\nshares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the voting\ninstruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.\nQ:\nShould I surrender my certificates or book-entry shares now?\nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment Procedures\u201d) will send each holder of record a letter of\ntransmittal (or an online portal for holders of record with valid email addresses if the Paying Agent does not\ncustomarily require a letter of transmittal) and written instructions that explain how to exchange shares of\nZendesk common stock represented by such holder\u2019s certificates or book-entry shares for the Merger\nConsideration.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Zendesk common stock after the Record Date but\nbefore the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger\nis expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of Zendesk common stock after the Record Date\nbut before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between\nyou and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Zendesk in\nwriting of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the\nMerger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to\nvote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Zendesk common\nstock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the\naccompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in\naccordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting-\nVoting at the Special Meeting\u201d).\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a Zendesk stockholder of record and holding shares in\n\u201cstreet name\u201d as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered to\nbe the \u201cstockholder of record\u201d with respect to those shares. In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy\ncard have been sent directly to you by Zendesk.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of\nshares of Zendesk common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to\nyou by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the Zendesk\nstockholder of record.

If you submit\nyour proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy\ncard.\nQ:\nHow many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address\nwith another Zendesk stockholder?\nA:\nThe SEC\u2019s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for\nproxy statements with respect to two or more Zendesk stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a\nsingle proxy statement to those Zendesk stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as\n\u201chouseholding,\u201d potentially provides extra convenience for Zendesk stockholders and cost savings for\ncompanies.\nZendesk and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy\nmaterials to multiple Zendesk stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninstructions have been received from the affected Zendesk stockholders. If at any time you no longer wish to\nparticipate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is\nreceiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single\ncopy, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Zendesk if you are a Zendesk\nstockholder of record by making a request to our Corporate Secretary at 989 Market Street, San Francisco, CA\n94103 or by calling (415) 418-7506. In addition, Zendesk will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the\naddress or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special Meeting. In\naddition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, Zendesk will file the final\nvoting results of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been certified, the preliminary\nresults) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nQ:\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nA:\nZendesk has engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc., which we refer to as \u201cMacKenzie,\u201d to assist in the solicitation\nof proxies for the Special Meeting. Zendesk estimates that it will pay MacKenzie a fee of approximately $50,000,\nplus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Zendesk has agreed to indemnify MacKenzie\nagainst various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain\nexceptions).\nZendesk also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective\nagents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of Zendesk common stock. Zendesk\ndirectors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in person. They\nwill not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe currently expect to complete the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, the exact timing of\ncompletion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified\nin the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our control.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain additional information about Zendesk?\nA:\nZendesk will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2022 Annual\nReport to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021,\nas amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A and Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A (which we refer to,\ncollectively, as \u201cAnnual Report\u201d), without charge to any Zendesk stockholder who makes a request in writing or\nby telephone to Zendesk\u2019s Corporate Secretary at 989 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103 or (415) 418-7506.\nIf you would like to request documents from us, please do so as soon as possible to receive them before the\nSpecial Meeting. Zendesk\u2019s Annual Report and other SEC filings may also be accessed at https://sec.gov or on\nZendesk\u2019s Investor website at https://investor.zendesk.com/.

A so-called\n\u201cbroker non-vote\u201d results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or\nmatters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal\nbecause they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting\ninstructions from the beneficial owner of such shares.

This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for business\ncombinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives. The Board of Directors has also regularly\nengaged with Zendesk stockholders to discuss and solicit their perspectives on Zendesk\u2019s strategic and financial\ndirection.\nOn October 28, 2021, Zendesk announced after market that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Momentive\nGlobal Inc., which we refer to as the \u201cMomentive Transaction.\u201d The Momentive Transaction was subject to Zendesk\nstockholder approval due to the amount of Zendesk common stock required to be issued to consummate the\ntransaction. A special meeting of Zendesk common stockholders to vote on the Momentive Transaction was later set\nfor February 25, 2022.\nThe closing price of Zendesk common stock the day the Momentive Transaction was announced after market was\n$119.01 per share. The closing price on the following day was $101.80, which represented a share price decline of\n14.5%. On that day, the NASDAQ Composite Index was 15,448, the IGV ETF (an index composed of North American\nequities in the expanded tech-software sector which includes Zendesk) was 435.63 and the BVP Emerging Cloud\nIndex (an index designed to track emerging public companies primarily involved in providing cloud software to\ncustomers which includes Zendesk) was 2,954.\nOn November 30, 2021, JANA Partners, a stockholder of Zendesk, sent an open letter to the Board of Directors\nexpressing its opposition to the Momentive Transaction and stating JANA Partners\u2019 intent to vote against the\nissuance of Zendesk common stock required to consummate the Momentive Transaction.\nOn February 7, 2022, the Board of Directors received an unsolicited, preliminary nonbinding proposal from a\nconsortium of private equity firms consisting of Permira, H&F and a financial sponsor (which we refer to as \u201cFinancial\nSponsor A,\u201d and together with Permira and H&F, the \u201cConsortium\u201d), regarding a potential acquisition of Zendesk for\nan indicative price range of between $127.00 and $132.00 per share in cash, subject to initiating and completing due\ndiligence, the negotiation of definitive transaction documents and approval from the Consortium members\u2019 respective\ninvestment committees prior to entry into final definitive agreements. The Consortium\u2019s preliminary nonbinding\nproposal was based solely on public information, as the Consortium had not received confidential information from\nZendesk, with the Consortium indicating they and their advisors would need access to Zendesk\u2019s business plan and\nCompany non-public data. On February 7, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk common stock was $98.43 per share.\n28TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 9, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting, together with its outside financial advisors, including\nGoldman Sachs, which had been engaged to act as financial advisor to Zendesk in connection with the Momentive\nTransaction, as well as its legal advisors, including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which we refer to as \u201cWachtell\nLipton.\u201d Following a review from representatives of its outside financial advisors of certain preliminary financial\naspects and analyses of the Consortium\u2019s preliminary nonbinding proposal and discussion among the participants of\nsuch financial analyses and the legal duties of the Board of Directors in connection with the evaluation of such\npreliminary nonbinding proposal, the Board of Directors concluded that the Consortium\u2019s preliminary nonbinding\nproposal significantly undervalued Zendesk and that it was not in the best interests of Zendesk and its stockholders\nto alter Zendesk\u2019s existing strategic plan and pursue the proposed transaction with the Consortium.\nOn February 10, 2022, Zendesk issued a press release announcing its rejection of the Consortium\u2019s preliminary\nnonbinding proposal.\nOn February 16, 2022, JANA Partners sent another open letter to the Board of Directors reiterating its opposition to\nthe Momentive Transaction and declaring its intent to nominate four director nominees for election to the Board of\nDirectors at Zendesk\u2019s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. JANA Partners also stated in the letter its belief that\nZendesk should engage with interested strategic and financial buyers to explore a sale of Zendesk. That same day,\nJANA Partners submitted a notice of nomination to Zendesk. Also that day, Zendesk issued a press release\nconfirming receipt of JANA Partners\u2019 notice of director nomination and stating that it would carefully review and\nevaluate the JANA Partners\u2019 director nominees.\nDuring the period prior to the February 25, 2022 special meeting of Zendesk stockholders held in connection with the\nMomentive Transaction, members of the Board of Directors and Zendesk management engaged in meetings and\nactive dialogue with Zendesk stockholders, including with JANA Partners. These discussions often concerned,\namong other things, the Momentive Transaction, governance matters, Zendesk\u2019s stock price performance and\npotential strategic alternatives, including the unsolicited preliminary nonbinding proposal from the Consortium.\nOn February 25, 2022, at the special meeting of Zendesk stockholders, a majority of votes cast by Zendesk\nstockholders did not vote to approve the issuance of Zendesk common stock in connection with the Momentive\nTransaction. Thereafter, Zendesk issued a press release announcing the termination of the Momentive Transaction.\nOn February 25, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk common stock was $115.48 per share.\nOn February 28, 2022, JANA Partners sent another open letter to the Board of Directors stating its belief that Zendesk\nrequired either significant board change, or in the absence of such change, should be sold.\nAt a meeting held on March 7, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed Zendesk\u2019s business and strategic\nplan, the current situation and the options and strategic alternatives potentially available to Zendesk, including\nZendesk\u2019s then current position and prospects as a standalone entity, the evolving competitive landscape, the\npressure on high-growth SaaS company share prices and multiples, the recent interest by the Consortium in a\npotential acquisition of Zendesk and JANA Partners\u2019 initiation of a proxy contest seeking representation on the\nBoard of Directors. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed a range of potential strategic alternatives,\nincluding continuing to execute on its standalone plan and whether it was the right time to consider a review of\nstrategic alternatives that could, among other things, lead to a potential sale of Zendesk, and considerations\nassociated with each alternative. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also provided the Board of Directors with an\noverview of a potential process for the sale of Zendesk, including illustrative timelines and stages for such a process\nand potential counterparties that might be interested in such a transaction. The Board of Directors, together with\nmembers of Zendesk management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, discussed the list of potential\ncounterparties and various considerations associated with reaching out to, and pursuing a strategic transaction with,\nsuch parties. After discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors determined to explore more intensively a\npotential process to review strategic alternatives for Zendesk. On March 7, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk\ncommon stock was $113.33 per share. Since October 28, 2021, the date of the announcement of the Momentive\nTransaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately 17%, the IGV ETF had declined\napproximately 28% and the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 42%.\nAt a meeting held on March 9, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed the potential engagement of Qatalyst\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPartners and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors to Zendesk in connection with a potential strategic review process,\ngiven their experience, expertise and qualifications. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of\nDirectors its fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with a potential strategic review process, including\nconsiderations in connection with pursuing either a standalone strategy or a sale of Zendesk.\nAt a meeting held on March 16, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed Qatalyst Partners\u2019 and Goldman Sachs\u2019 respective draft\nengagement letters and relationship disclosure letters made available to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting.\nThe Board of Directors and representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed certain of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 and Goldman\nSachs\u2019 prior relationships with members of the Consortium and/or their respective affiliates as well as Goldman Sachs\u2019\nrole as a counterparty to Zendesk\u2019s capped call options that had been disclosed, as further described in the section\nof this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.\u201d The Board of Directors reviewed the\ndisclosures and determined that none of the disclosed relationships would impact Qatalyst Partners\u2019 or Goldman\nSachs\u2019 ability to act in an independent and disinterested manner in rendering their services to the Board of Directors\nin connection with the potential transaction and approved Zendesk\u2019s entry into the engagement letters with Qatalyst\nPartners and Goldman Sachs, respectively.\nThereafter, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs joined the meeting, and the Board of Directors,\ntogether with members of Zendesk management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and\nWachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed considerations relating to a potential strategic review process, including as\nto the then current market backdrop, the valuation of Zendesk, investor sentiment about Zendesk, the pending proxy\ncontest with JANA Partners, and the recent interest in an acquisition of Zendesk by the Consortium. After\ndiscussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors (i) determined to commence a process to review strategic\nalternatives, including a potential sale of Zendesk, (ii) authorized representatives of Qatalyst Partners to contact\ncertain potential counterparties, including the Consortium, to ascertain their interest in a strategic transaction\ninvolving Zendesk, and (iii) authorized Wachtell Lipton, working with Zendesk management, to negotiate and execute\nnon-disclosure agreements with potential counterparties.\nCommencing on March 17, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners began contacting potential counterparties\nregarding a potential strategic transaction. At the Board of Directors\u2019 direction, representatives of Qatalyst Partners\ncontacted 26 potential counterparties (including and counting the members of the Consortium and their potential co-\ninvestors as one potential counterparty), including 16 potential strategic partners and 10 potential financial sponsors.\nEleven of the 26 potential counterparties (including and counting the members of the Consortium and their potential\nco-investors as one potential counterparty) entered into non-disclosure agreements with Zendesk and were provided\nwith preliminary due diligence materials. The non-disclosure agreements with nine of the potential counterparties\n(including and counting the members of the Consortium and their potential co-investors as one potential\ncounterparty) included standstill provisions, and none of the standstill provisions are currently in effect.\nAt a meeting held on March 23, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed the then current status of the\nstrategic review process, including the progress on the outreach to potential counterparties.\nAt a meeting held on March 30, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, again discussed the then current status of\nthe strategic review process, including the progress on the outreach to potential counterparties with respect to a\npotential transaction and feedback received thus far. Members of Zendesk management also discussed a proposed\nlong-range plan through calendar year 2025 for Zendesk that would be provided to potential bidders in the strategic\nreview process.\nBetween April 4, 2022, and April 20, 2022, Zendesk management conducted initial meetings with 10 potential\ncounterparties (including and counting the members of the Consortium and their potential co-investors as one\npotential counterparty), including four potential strategic partners and six potential financial sponsors. One potential\nstrategic partner that had executed a non-disclosure agreement withdrew from the process prior to attending a\nmanagement presentation.\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn April 6, 2022, at the request of the Consortium, Zendesk agreed to allow a limited partner of a member of the\nConsortium to join the Consortium as an additional source of equity financing (which we refer to as \u201cSignificant LP\nCo-Investor A\u201d), based on its belief that such additional equity financing source would increase the likelihood of an\nactionable bid to acquire Zendesk.\nOn April 7, 2022, Zendesk management opened an electronic data room with additional due diligence information and\nbegan providing access to the 10 potential counterparties that had entered into non-disclosure agreements with\nZendesk (including and counting the members of the Consortium and their potential co-investors as one\ncounterparty). The potential counterparties were also given the opportunity to spend additional time with\nrepresentatives of Zendesk management as part of their ongoing diligence.\nAlso on April 7, 2022, Mr. Carl Bass, the lead independent director of Zendesk, Ms. Hilarie Koplow-McAdams, an\nindependent director of Zendesk, and members of Zendesk management met with representatives of JANA Partners\nto discuss the then current proxy contest. During the discussion, the JANA Partners representatives noted that they\nwere primarily focused on a change in board composition of Zendesk, or alternatively, a sale of Zendesk. When asked\nwhether JANA Partners had expectations regarding the value of a potential sale transaction, the representatives of\nJANA Partners noted that they did not have a specific expectation but would generally defer to a value that was\nreached through a comprehensive sale process.\nOn or around April 12, 2022, a representative of the Consortium met with Mikkel Svane, the CEO of Zendesk, to\ndiscuss the potential transaction between the Consortium and Zendesk.\nAt a meeting held on April 13, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed an update on the\nstrategic review process, including meetings with representatives of Zendesk management and other discussions\nthat had taken place with the potential counterparties in the process and the perceived level of interest of each party,\nas well as the strategic parties and financial sponsors that had indicated that they would not be interested in\npursuing a potential transaction. The Board of Directors also discussed and reviewed the potential proxy contest\nwith JANA Partners, and continued this discussion at a meeting attended by members of the Board of Directors and a\nrepresentative of Wachtell Lipton on April 15, 2022.\nOn April 14, 2022, at the request of a financial sponsor (which we refer to as \u201cBidder 2\u201d), Zendesk agreed to allow a\nlimited partner of Bidder 2 to join Bidder 2 as an additional source of equity financing, based on its belief that such\nadditional equity financing source would increase the likelihood of an actionable bid to acquire Zendesk.\nOn April 18, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent a process letter to each of the counterparties that had\nentered into non-disclosure agreements with Zendesk, requesting preliminary indications of interest by May 5, 2022.\nAlso the same day, Bloomberg published an after-hours report that Zendesk was working with Qatalyst Partners and\nexploring a potential sale, with the stock price closing on April 19, 2022 at $129.12 per share, an increase of\napproximately 6.1% as compared to the closing price on April 18, 2022 of $121.69.\nBetween April 18, 2022 and April 19, 2022, a summary of financial performance for the first quarter of 2022 and a long-\nrange plan for Zendesk through calendar year 2025 that had been prepared by Zendesk\u2019s management, as further\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Certain Financial Projections-March 2022 Case,\u201d was\nprovided to the potential counterparties via the electronic data room. Zendesk achieved revenue of $388.3 million,\nrepresenting year-over-year growth of approximately 30% and outperformance relative to the analyst consensus by\napproximately 1%, and Annual Recurring Revenue of $1,535 million, representing year-over-year growth of\napproximately 30%. However, Zendesk recorded gross bookings of $136.0 million, representing year-over-year growth\nof only approximately 6%, which fell below the internal outlook of $159.3 million by 15%, and recorded net bookings\nof $86.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of only approximately 4%, which fell below the internal outlook\nof $104.3 million by 17%.\nOn April 19, 2022, at the request of the Consortium, Zendesk agreed to allow a limited partner of a member of the\nConsortium to join the Consortium as an additional source of equity financing (which we refer to as \u201cSignificant LP\nCo-Investor B\u201d), based on its belief that such additional equity financing source would increase the likelihood of an\nactionable bid to acquire Zendesk.\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt meetings held on April 20, 2022 and April 26, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed an update on\nthe strategic review process, including meetings with representatives of Zendesk management and other discussions\nthat had taken place with the potential counterparties in the process and the perceived level of interest of each\nremaining party, as well as the additional strategic parties and financial sponsors that had indicated that they would\nnot be interested in pursuing a potential transaction. The Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, also discussed potential\nalternatives to a sale of Zendesk, as well as updates on recent engagement with its stockholders, including JANA\nPartners.\nOn May 2, 2022, at the request of the Consortium, Zendesk agreed to allow a limited partner of a member of the\nConsortium (which we refer to as \u201cSignificant LP Co-Investor C\u201d) to join the Consortium as an additional source of\nequity financing, based on its belief that such additional equity financing source would increase the likelihood of an\nactionable bid to acquire Zendesk.\nOn May 3, 2022, at the request of Bidder 2, Zendesk agreed to allow a limited partner of Bidder 2 to join Bidder 2 as an\nadditional source of equity financing, based on its belief that such additional equity financing source would increase\nthe likelihood of an actionable bid to acquire Zendesk.\nOn May 4, 2022, prior to the initial deadline for preliminary indications of interest, representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nprovided to each of the remaining potential bidders in the strategic review process an updated long-range plan for\nZendesk through calendar year 2025 that had been prepared by Zendesk management primarily reflecting certain\nchanges to the long-range plan previously provided to the bidders, as further described in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c-Certain Financial Projections-March 2022 Case.\u201d\nOn May 5, 2022, two potential financial counterparties submitted preliminary indications of interest to acquire\nZendesk for cash: the Consortium, which indicated a price of $120.00 per share of Zendesk common stock, and Bidder\n2, which indicated a price range of $125.00 to $135.00 per share of Zendesk common stock. In making its submission,\nthe Consortium noted that (a) its bid remained subject to completion of diligence and (b) the market had corrected\ndramatically since submitting its preliminary nonbinding proposal on February 7, 2022, and that if Zendesk were\ntrading in line with comparable companies and the NASDAQ as a whole and without the impact of speculation\nregarding a potential acquisition of Zendesk, it would be trading in the range of $75.00 to $88.00 per share. In making\nits submission, Bidder 2 cited market uncertainty and concerns about business momentum, in light of Zendesk\u2019s\nperformance in the first quarter of 2022, for providing an indication as a range. Bidder 2 also referenced the impact of\nspeculation regarding a potential acquisition on Zendesk\u2019s then current share price and noted that it believed a share\nprice of $95.11 per share based on the last closing price of Zendesk common stock on November 29, 2021, prior to\nactivism by JANA Partners, as being more representative of the unaffected Zendesk share price. On May 5, 2022, the\nclosing price of Zendesk common stock was $117.73 per share. Since October 28, 2021, the date of the announcement\nof the Momentive Transaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately 20%, the IGV ETF had\ndeclined approximately 32% and the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 47%.\nAt a meeting held on May 6, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed the preliminary\nindications of interest received from the Consortium and Bidder 2. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman\nSachs and Wachtell Lipton discussed and reviewed with the Board of Directors the terms and conditions of the\nindications of interest, discussing with the Board of Directors the key assumptions underlying the indicative\nvaluations included in the preliminary indications of interest, proposed financing plans, timing of required internal\nand external approvals, as well as diligence requests made by the potential counterparties. Representatives of\nQatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton also provided the Board of Directors with a possible outline\nfor the next stages of the strategic review process with the potential counterparties, including the scheduling of\nadditional diligence sessions, as well as the timing for preparation and negotiation of definitive transaction\ndocuments with respect to a potential transaction. Following discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors\nauthorized Zendesk\u2019s advisors, working with Zendesk management, to proceed with the process of exploring a\npotential sale of Zendesk, permit access to additional diligence materials on Zendesk for each of the Consortium and\nBidder 2 and schedule additional diligence sessions with representatives of each of the Consortium and Bidder 2.\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBetween May 7, 2022 and May 8, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners had multiple discussions with\nrepresentatives of the Consortium and provided guidance to the Consortium that they would need to improve their\nproposed price of $120.00 per share.\nOn May 9, 2022, representatives of the Consortium contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to inform them that\nFinancial Sponsor A had withdrawn from the bidding group for a range of reasons, including that Financial Sponsor\nA was concerned with worsening market conditions and volatility as well as the inflated nature of Zendesk\u2019s trading\nprice. Representatives of the Consortium informed Qatalyst Partners that they were working to secure additional\nequity financing to enable them to continue in the strategic review process. On May 9, 2022, the closing price of\nZendesk common stock was $99.14 per share.\nBetween May 9, 2022 and May 24, 2022, representatives of the Consortium and representatives of Zendesk had\nmultiple meetings to discuss certain confirmatory due diligence matters, including among other things Zendesk\u2019s\nproduct offering and environment, cybersecurity and risk management, accounting, tax matters, legal matters, HR\nmatters and financial matters (including business momentum).\nBetween May 10, 2022 and May 17, 2022, representatives of Bidder 2 and representatives of Zendesk had multiple\nmeetings to discuss certain confirmatory due diligence matters, including among other things Zendesk\u2019s product\noffering and environment, cybersecurity and data privacy, accounting, legal matters, tax matters and financial matters\n(including business momentum).\nOn May 11, 2022, Zendesk circulated a form of merger agreement to the Consortium and Bidder 2, and instructed the\nbidders to contact Wachtell Lipton with any questions.\nAlso on May 11, 2022, representatives of the Consortium and Mr. Svane met to discuss, among other things,\nZendesk\u2019s business and growth opportunities.\nOn May 13, 2022, at the request of the Consortium, Zendesk agreed to allow two additional financial sponsors to join\nthe Consortium as additional sources of equity financing (which we refer to respectively as \u201cFinancial Sponsor B\u201d\nand \u201cFinancial Sponsor C\u201d), based on its belief that such partnering would increase the likelihood of an actionable\nbid to acquire Zendesk.\nAlso on May 13, 2022, Zendesk provided an update on its business momentum in April 2022 to the Consortium and\nBidder 2. In April 2022, Zendesk recorded gross bookings of $34.6 million, representing a year-over-year decline of\napproximately 7%, which fell below the internal outlook of $42.7 million by 19%, and net bookings of $16.5 million,\nrepresenting a year-over-year decline of approximately 13%, which fell below the internal outlook of $20.8 million by\n20%. In light of business momentum worsening relative to performance in the first quarter of 2022, both the\nConsortium and Bidder 2 requested additional diligence information and management time to better understand\nunderlying business trends.\nAlso on May 13, 2022, a representative of the Consortium met with Mr. Svane to discuss the potential transaction\nbetween the Consortium and Zendesk.\nOn May 16, 2022, to address Bidder 2\u2019s concerns around Zendesk\u2019s business momentum, Mr. Svane met with the\nCEO of Bidder 2 to discuss underlying trends driving Zendesk\u2019s then current business momentum and implications\nfor the long-term financial prospects of Zendesk\u2019s business.\nAlso on May 16, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent a process letter to each of the Consortium and\nBidder 2, requesting final, binding proposals by May 25, 2022.\nAt a meeting on May 18, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with Zendesk management and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed an update on the strategic review process,\nincluding the diligence process undertaken over the past several weeks by the Consortium and Bidder 2, the status of\nthe parties\u2019 financing efforts and then current market conditions. The same day, the Consortium spent additional time\nwith representatives of Zendesk management discussing bookings trends to address concerns around underlying\nbusiness momentum.\nOn May 21, 2022, outside counsel to Bidder 2 submitted a markup of the merger agreement and forms of limited\nguaranty and equity commitment letter to representatives of Wachtell Lipton and, on May 23, 2022,\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton provided preliminary feedback on the merger agreement to Bidder 2\u2019s outside\ncounsel, including with respect to the regulatory efforts standard reflected in Bidder 2\u2019s markup of the merger\nagreement as well as the proposed termination fee to be paid by Bidder 2 to Zendesk in certain circumstances.\nOn May 23, 2022, representatives of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP, counsel to the Consortium, which\nwe refer to as \u201cFried Frank,\u201d submitted a markup of the merger agreement and related disclosure schedules to\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton which proposed a reverse termination fee equal to 4% of Zendesk\u2019s equity value\npayable by the Consortium to Zendesk under certain circumstances and, on May 24, 2022, representatives of\nWachtell Lipton provided preliminary feedback on the merger agreement to representatives of Fried Frank, including\nwith respect to the regulatory efforts standard reflected in the Consortium\u2019s markup of the merger agreement as well\nas the proposed termination fee to be paid by the Consortium to Zendesk in certain circumstances.\nOn May 24, 2022, representatives of the Consortium contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to inform them\nthat Significant LP Co-Investor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C had withdrawn from the bidding\ngroup for a range of reasons, including concerns with the declining business momentum of Zendesk, persistent and\npotentially worsening market conditions and volatility as well as the inflated nature of Zendesk\u2019s trading price. As a\nresult, the Consortium had not yet arranged all the equity financing required to submit a nonbinding proposal and\nthey inquired whether Qatalyst Partners could partner them with other potential equity financing sources involved in\nthe strategic review process. They also indicated that, in light of recent declines in the valuations of comparable\ncompanies and deteriorating business momentum of Zendesk, they had lowered the value they believed they might\nbe prepared to offer to $96.00 per share of Zendesk common stock. On May 24, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk\ncommon stock was $88.18 per share.\nOn May 25, 2022, representatives of Bidder 2 confirmed that they would not be able to submit a proposal that day but\nwere continuing to work on a potential proposal. The closing price of Zendesk common stock was $92.19 per share, a\n22% decline relative to the closing price on May 5, 2022, the date initial indications of interest were requested. Also,\nsince October 28, 2021, the date of the announcement of the Momentive Transaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index\nhad declined approximately 26%, the IGV ETF had declined approximately 37% and the BVP Emerging Cloud Index\nhad declined approximately 54%.\nOn May 26, 2022, representatives of Bidder 2 contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and communicated that\nin light of declining valuations of comparable companies, ongoing market uncertainty and deteriorating business\nmomentum of Zendesk, they would not be able to submit a proposal within or close to their previously indicated\nrange. They indicated verbally that they may be able to offer as high as $110.00 per share of Zendesk common stock\nbut would require several additional weeks to secure the necessary equity financing.\nLater the same day, Bidder 2 submitted a nonbinding proposal, together with a markup of the merger agreement and\nrelated disclosure schedules, along with forms of limited guaranty, equity commitment letter and debt commitment\nletter, to acquire Zendesk for cash at a price of $110.00 per share of Zendesk common stock. The nonbinding proposal\nremained subject to the negotiation of definitive transaction documents and additional diligence regarding the\ndeteriorating business momentum of Zendesk, and Bidder 2 requested an additional 10 business days to finalize\nequity commitments.\nAt a meeting on May 27, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed an update on the strategic\nreview process, including the challenges both bidders were having securing financing and maintaining valuations in\nlight of recent market declines and the deteriorating business momentum of Zendesk. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners updated the Board of Directors that representatives of the Consortium had informed representatives of\nQatalyst Partners that the Consortium did not have the equity financing necessary to submit a final proposal to\nacquire Zendesk. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then summarized the nonbinding proposal that had been\nsubmitted by Bidder 2, but noted that Bidder 2 had informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it had not yet\narranged all the equity financing required for the nonbinding proposal and had requested an additional 10 business\ndays to attempt to finalize equity commitments. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs then\ndiscussed Zendesk\u2019s long- and short-term trading performance, hypothetical unaffected stock price, and an updated\nfinancial analysis of Zendesk. The Board of Directors discussed the uncertainty\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsurrounding Bidder 2\u2019s ability to secure equity financing necessary for its proposal and whether a higher price could\nbe obtained in the then current market. Following further discussion, the Board of Directors agreed to continue\ndiscussion of the nonbinding proposal and the potential response at a meeting the following day.\nAlso on May 27, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners communicated to representatives of the Consortium that\nthe Board of Directors would consider any actionable proposal, but until such time (i) would cease to engage with the\nConsortium because it had failed to deliver an actionable proposal and (ii) was focused on actionable proposals from\nother potential counterparties.\nAt a meeting on May 28, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton, continued its discussion and review of Bidder 2\u2019s nonbinding proposal to acquire\nZendesk, including the fact that Bidder 2 did not have sufficient equity financing and had requested an additional 10\nbusiness days to attempt to secure the necessary equity commitments, and the impact of the strategic review\nprocess, and the related uncertainty, on Zendesk\u2019s operations, management and other employees. Representatives of\nWachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with the\nstrategic review process and the Board of Directors\u2019 evaluation of Bidder 2\u2019s nonbinding proposal. Following\ndiscussion, the Board of Directors determined to instruct representatives of Qatalyst Partners to engage with Bidder\n2 in an effort to improve on the proposed price to $115.00 per share and to set a timeline to arrange the necessary\nequity financing for its proposal and reach a definitive agreement with respect to the proposal.\nAlso on May 28, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided guidance to Bidder 2 that they would need to\nimprove their proposed price to $115.00 per share.\nOn June 1, 2022, representatives of Bidder 2 indicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they were not able\nto offer $115.00 per share and suggested that they would only be able to transact somewhere between the then\ncurrent share price of Zendesk common stock (the closing price of Zendesk common stock on June 1, 2022 was\n$90.12) and $100.00 per share, but that even at that price range, deteriorating market conditions and volatility were\ncausing the internal processes for limited partners to secure equity commitments to be extended as their internal\ncommittees requested additional work and time for review.\nOn June 5, 2022, representatives of the Consortium inquired whether Qatalyst Partners could partner them with other\npotential equity financing sources involved in the process. No other bidders beyond the Consortium and Bidder 2\nremained actively engaged in the process after that point. In response to this request and after receiving approval\nfrom Zendesk, Qatalyst Partners inquired whether Bidder 2 would be willing to consider a partnership with a\nconsortium of potential financial sponsors involved in the process to acquire Zendesk. Bidder 2 stated that it was\nunwilling to do so, citing, among other things, the complexities in any such arrangement.\nAt a meeting held on June 6, 2022, the Board of Directors discussed, together with members of Zendesk management\nand representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, the fact that Bidder 2 had\ncommunicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that despite its efforts it was not able to secure the financing\nrequired for a bid at $110.00 per share, citing deteriorating business momentum of Zendesk, adverse market\nconditions and difficulties in securing financing to fully finance the bid and that the price would need to be in the\nrange of $90.00 to $100.00 per share for Bidder 2 to be able to transact, and that even at the lower range, Bidder 2\nwould still need to do additional work to secure the necessary financing. Following discussion, the Board of\nDirectors considered whether to continue the strategic review process or proceed as a standalone entity. It\nconsidered, among other things, that despite extending the strategic review process to provide interested\ncounterparties additional time and access to attempt to secure sufficient financing, no actionable proposals had been\nsubmitted, as well as the impact on Zendesk of the prolonged strategic review process and the resulting uncertainty.\nThe Board of Directors unanimously determined that continuing to execute on Zendesk\u2019s strategic plan as a\nstandalone public company would be in the best interests of Zendesk and its stockholders at that point in time. The\nBoard of Directors also unanimously determined that, in light of the disruptive impact of the market rumors on\nZendesk\u2019s business, Zendesk should publicly announce that it had completed a strategic review process and had\ndetermined to remain independent. At a second meeting held later on June 6, 2022, the Board of Directors further\ndiscussed, together with members of Zendesk management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wachtell\nLipton, potential engagement with JANA Partners in light of the potential public announcement of the termination of\nthe strategic review process. Following discussion, the Board of Directors\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nauthorized representatives of Wachtell Lipton to engage with outside counsel for JANA Partners to discuss a\npotential limited-duration non-disclosure agreement to allow Zendesk to inform JANA Partners of its intention to\nannounce that it had conducted and completed a strategic review process that did not produce any actionable offers\nand that Zendesk would be scheduling its 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, and to discuss potential settlement\nproposals with JANA Partners. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton engaged with outside counsel for JANA Partners\nafter the meeting.\nOn June 7, 2022, a representative of JANA Partners\u2019 outside counsel contacted representatives from Wachtell Lipton\nto express that JANA Partners was not willing to sign a limited duration non-disclosure agreement for the purpose of\nhaving discussions with Zendesk. On June 8, 2022, JANA Partners issued a press release announcing its intention to\nsue Zendesk to compel Zendesk to schedule the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders.\nOn June 8, 2022, representatives of the Consortium notified representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they continued\nto be interested in pursuing an acquisition of Zendesk and that they believed they may be able to secure the\nnecessary financing if given a few days and subject to completion of confirmatory diligence.\nAt a meeting later on June 8, 2022, the Board of Directors discussed again, together with members of Zendesk\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, the absence of any\nactionable proposals to acquire Zendesk, the possibility that, if given more time, the Consortium or Bidder 2 might\nsubmit an actionable proposal, the difficulties the bidders had experienced in securing financing and maintaining\nvaluations throughout the process despite the Board of Directors extending the process on multiple occasions, the\nimpact that publicly terminating the strategic review process may have on Zendesk\u2019s share price and the impact on\nZendesk of the prolonged strategic review process and the continued uncertainty on Zendesk\u2019s business, operations\nand employee morale. Following this discussion, the Board of Directors authorized the release of a public\nannouncement that the Board of Directors had conducted and completed a comprehensive review of strategic\nalternatives aimed at enhancing stockholder value, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, and had\ndetermined to remain independent in light of the results of the strategic review process.\nAlso on June 8, 2022, CNBC reported that Zendesk had terminated the previously rumored sale process. The closing\nprice of Zendesk common stock declined to $80.52 per share, approximately 7% lower than the closing price on June\n7, 2022.\nOn June 9, 2022, Zendesk issued the contemplated press release, disclosing that Zendesk and its advisors had\nsolicited interest from a wide range of potential strategic partners and financial sponsors regarding a potential sale of\nZendesk, that no actionable proposals had been submitted and that the Board of Directors had unanimously\ndetermined that continuing to execute on Zendesk\u2019s strategic plan as a standalone public company would be in the\nbest interests of Zendesk and its stockholders at that time. The press release also announced that Zendesk\u2019s 2022\nannual meeting of stockholders would be held on August 17, 2022. The day after the issuance of the press release,\nZendesk\u2019s closing stock price declined to $69.04 per share, approximately 14% lower than the closing price on June 8,\n2022.\nOn June 10, 2022, Zendesk\u2019s closing stock price declined further to $64.97 per share, approximately 6% lower than the\nclosing price on June 9, 2022.\nAt a meeting held on June 11, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the commencement of settlement discussions\nwith JANA Partners to seek to settle JANA Partners\u2019 announced proxy fight. Over the course of the next several\ndays, members of the Board of Directors and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wachtell Lipton had\ndiscussions with representatives of JANA Partners and their outside counsel with respect to a potential settlement.\nOn June 13, 2022, Zendesk\u2019s closing stock price declined further to $59.96 per share, approximately 8% lower than the\nclosing price on June 10, 2022.\nOn June 14, 2022, representatives of the Consortium contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express\nrenewed interest in submitting a proposal to acquire Zendesk, subject to receipt of additional due diligence, including\non actual results for gross and net bookings for May 2022 and an update on Zendesk\u2019s overall business momentum.\nThat same day, a representative of the Consortium verbally indicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that he\nbelieved such proposal could be as high as $82.00 per share, if actual\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nresults for May 2022 were in line with their expectations and subject to satisfactory responses to certain other\nconfirmatory due diligence items. Following the outreach from the Consortium, representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nreached out to Bidder 2 to inquire whether it had any interest in a renewed bid for Zendesk. Bidder 2 stated that it\nwould also need to understand actual results for gross and net bookings for May 2022 and receive an update on\nZendesk\u2019s overall business momentum, and that it would need to see improvement in these trends relative to the prior\nmonths to support the submission of a proposal. On June 14, 2022, Zendesk\u2019s share price declined further to $57.04\nper share, approximately 5% lower than the closing price on June 13, 2022.\nOn June 15, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided actual gross and net bookings for May 2022, which\nindicated weaker business momentum than in prior months, as well as an updated view of expected gross and net\nbookings for June 2022, to representatives of the Consortium and representatives of Bidder 2. In May 2022, Zendesk\nrecorded gross bookings of $35.7 million, representing a year-over-year decline of approximately 16%, which fell\nbelow the internal outlook of $51.6 million by 31%, and net bookings of $16.8 million, representing a year-over-year\ndecline of approximately 36%, which fell below the internal outlook of $32.2 million by 48%.\nLater, at a meeting on June 15, 2022, the Board of Directors discussed, together with members of Zendesk\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wachtell Lipton, the outreach by representatives of the\nConsortium and the expectation that the Consortium would be submitting a revised proposal to acquire Zendesk.\nMembers of Zendesk management discussed the then current economic environment and financial forecast,\nincluding the negative trends in gross and net bookings being experienced by Zendesk. The Board of Directors also\ndiscussed with members of Zendesk management and the advisors the potential terms of a settlement with JANA\nPartners.\nOn June 16, 2022, Zendesk\u2019s share price declined further to $54.53 per share, approximately 4% lower than the closing\nprice on June 14, 2022.\nOn June 17, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners received a nonbinding proposal from the Consortium offering\nto acquire 100% of the common stock of Zendesk for a price of $75.50 per share, subject to limited confirmatory due\ndiligence and the negotiation of definitive transaction documents, along with an updated markup of the draft merger\nagreement and disclosure schedules (which we refer to as the \u201cJune 17 Proposal\u201d). The draft merger agreement,\nreflected, among other things, a proposed reverse termination fee equal to 4% of Zendesk\u2019s equity value payable by\nthe Consortium to Zendesk under certain circumstances (consistent with the draft of the merger agreement submitted\nby Fried Frank on May 23, 2022). Along with the June 17 Proposal, the Consortium submitted a markup of the related\ndisclosure schedules, executed debt and preferred equity commitment letters and forms of equity commitment letters\nand fee funding agreements. As part of the June 17 Proposal, the Consortium informed Zendesk that Significant LP\nCo-Investor B and Significant LP Co-Investor C would be increasing their commitments and investing alongside the\nConsortium. During a conversation with representatives of the Consortium, such representatives indicated that they\nhad lowered the price at which they were willing to transact in light of the actual gross and net bookings results for\nMay 2022, which were weaker than they had expected, and the continued deterioration in business momentum at\nZendesk. On June 17, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk common stock was $55.87 per share, approximately 30%\nlower than the closing price on June 8, 2022 (since October 28, 2021, the date of the announcement of the Momentive\nTransaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately 31%, the IGV ETF had declined\napproximately 40%, the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 56% and the Zendesk share price had\ndeclined approximately 53%).\nFollowing receipt of the June 17 Proposal and after consultation with members of the Board of Directors,\nrepresentatives of Zendesk proposed a limited duration confidentiality agreement with JANA Partners to disclose to\nJANA Partners the June 17 Proposal in the context of settlement discussions with JANA Partners. JANA Partners\nagreed to enter into a limited duration confidentiality agreement on June 18, 2022.\nOn the morning of June 19, 2022, Mr. Bass and a representative of Wachtell Lipton met with representatives from\nJANA Partners, to discuss the June 17 Proposal pursuant to the confidentiality agreement entered into between\nZendesk and JANA Partners. The representatives of JANA Partners expressed support for Zendesk being open to\nthe proposed transaction and attempting to engage with the Consortium in an effort to see if it were possible to\nimprove on the proposed price.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt a meeting later on June 19, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with representatives of Qatalyst Partners,\nGoldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed the status of settlement discussions with JANA\nPartners and Mr. Bass\u2019s conversation with representatives of JANA Partners, as well as the June 17 Proposal as\ncompared to continuing to operate Zendesk on a standalone basis. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners summarized\nthe terms and conditions of the June 17 Proposal, discussing with the Board of Directors the key assumptions\nunderlying the indicative valuations included in the June 17 Proposal, proposed financing plans as well as the\nconfirmatory diligence requests made by the Consortium. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wachtell Lipton\nalso provided the Board of Directors with a potential timeline for a transaction with the Consortium, should the Board\nof Directors determine to consider the June 17 Proposal. Members of Zendesk management discussed with the Board\nof Directors the work that Zendesk management had commenced to update Zendesk\u2019s long-range plan to account for\nthe significant changes in economic conditions and negative trends in gross and net bookings for Zendesk and\ndeterioration in business momentum that deviated materially from the assumptions underlying the March 2022 Case.\nFollowing discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to\nengage with the Consortium in an effort to improve on the proposed price and authorized representatives of Wachtell\nLipton, working with Zendesk management, to proceed with negotiating definitive transaction documents with the\nConsortium with respect to a potential transaction.\nBetween June 17, 2022, and June 23, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners had multiple conversations with\nrepresentatives of Bidder 2 regarding whether they had secured the necessary equity financing and whether they\nplanned to submit a proposal to acquire Zendesk. The conclusion of these conversations was that, in light of\nongoing concerns around business momentum, Bidder 2 would not be prepared to submit a proposal without seeing\nactual gross and net bookings data for June 2022 and assurances that business momentum was improving.\nOn June 20, 2022, Mr. Svane and Mr. John Geschke, the Chief of Staff of Zendesk, met with representatives of the\nConsortium to discuss negative trends in gross and net bookings for May 2022, business momentum trends and\nforecasts for the second quarter of 2022 as well as possible adjustments to Zendesk\u2019s cost structure to reflect\nchanges in the macroeconomic outlook and business momentum.\nFollowing several discussions among representatives of Qatalyst Partners and the Consortium, on June 21, 2022, the\nConsortium submitted a \u201cbest and final\u201d proposal to acquire 100% of the common stock of Zendesk for a price of\n$77.50 per share, subject to limited confirmatory due diligence and the negotiation of definitive transaction\ndocuments (which we refer to as the \u201cJune 21 Proposal\u201d). Along with the June 21 Proposal, the Consortium submitted\nexecuted debt and preferred equity commitment letters as well as forms of equity commitment letters and fee funding\nagreements. Following the receipt of the June 21 Proposal, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reached out to Bidder\n2 again to inquire whether there was any interest in a renewed bid for Zendesk, and Bidder 2 re-confirmed that it was\nnot willing to submit a proposal, again citing concerns over the negative business momentum of Zendesk and\nchallenges relating to the overall economic environment, among other factors. On June 21, 2022, the closing price of\nZendesk common stock was $56.04 per share (since October 28, 2021, the date of the announcement of the\nMomentive Transaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately 28%, the IGV ETF had declined\napproximately 39%, the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 55% and the Zendesk share price had\ndeclined approximately 53%).\nOn June 21, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Fried Frank a revised draft of the merger\nagreement, and thereafter the parties continued to exchange drafts of the merger agreement and the ancillary\nagreements through their respective legal advisors, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Fried Frank\ncontinued to discuss the open issues in these agreements, including issues relating to the amount of the termination\nfee payable by the Consortium to Zendesk in certain circumstances, the treatment of equity awards and other\nemployee matters, restrictions on the operations of Zendesk between signing and closing and the remedies available\nto the parties (including the right to specific performance and damages in certain circumstances).\nOn June 21 and 22, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke further with representatives of JANA Partners to\napprise them of developments with respect to the proposed transaction, including the June 21 Proposal, and to\nunderstand JANA Partners\u2019 perspectives, including the Consortium having indicated its updated\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nproposed price was \u201cbest and final\u201d and Bidder 2 having indicated it would not be submitting a bid. Representatives\nof JANA Partners indicated that JANA Partners would not oppose a transaction at $77.50 per share and indicated\nthat it would expect to terminate its proxy contest upon an announcement of such a transaction.\nOn June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting, together with members of Zendesk management and\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, to discuss the status of negotiations with\nthe Consortium. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners updated the Board of Directors on discussions with\nrepresentatives of the Consortium, noting that representatives of the Consortium had reiterated to representatives of\nQatalyst Partners that $77.50 was their \u201cbest and final\u201d offer. Members of Zendesk management also presented an\nupdated operating plan for Zendesk for the year ending December 31, 2022, along with an updated 2031 long-range\nplan for Zendesk (which we define as the \u201cJune 2022 Case\u201d in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Certain\nFinancial Projections\u201d) in light of the changes in the internal and external business environment, including below-\nexpectation actual gross and net bookings for the months of April and May 2022, challenges to Zendesk\u2019s\nperformance resulting from elevated levels of attrition in critical sales functions and employee distraction as well as\nsignificant changes in economic conditions facing Zendesk and its industry more generally, including increased risk\nof recession, persistent high inflation and the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on Zendesk\u2019s customer segments.\nRepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board of Directors their financial\nanalyses with respect to Zendesk based on Zendesk management\u2019s projections. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton\nthen provided the Board of Directors with an overview of the material open issues in the draft merger agreement and\nfinancing documents, including the acquiror termination fee of approximately 4% of Zendesk\u2019s equity value proposed\nby the Consortium, the regulatory approvals that would be required in connection with a transaction and the\nobligations of the parties in the draft transaction documents related to such regulatory efforts. Following discussion,\nthe Board of Directors authorized the advisors to move forward to seek to finalize proposed definitive agreements for\na transaction at the $77.50 per share cash price.\nOn June 23, 2022, representatives of Fried Frank sent representatives of Wachtell Lipton a revised draft of the merger\nagreement which proposed, among other things, a reverse termination fee payable to Zendesk under certain\ncircumstances of approximately 5% of Zendesk\u2019s equity value (an increase of 1% from the prior draft of merger\nagreement submitted by the Consortium).\nThereafter, on June 23, 2022, representatives of Fried Frank and representatives of Wachtell Lipton met via\nconference call to discuss the draft of merger agreement submitted by representatives of Fried Frank to\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Fried Frank noted to representatives of Wachtell Lipton that a\nreverse termination fee of approximately 6% of Zendesk\u2019s equity value payable by the Consortium under certain\ncircumstances would be acceptable to the Consortium if Zendesk accepted the Consortium\u2019s proposals on certain\nother matters. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton indicated that this proposal may be acceptable to Zendesk.\nOn June 23, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, held a meeting to discuss and consider whether to approve\nentry into definitive transaction documents providing for a merger of Zendesk with and into an affiliate of the\nConsortium. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties under\nDelaware law in connection with a potential sale of Zendesk. Members of Zendesk management discussed the June\n2022 Case that had been previously provided to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved its use\nby Zendesk\u2019s financial advisors in connection with their analyses of the potential transaction. Representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs reviewed and discussed their respective financial analyses regarding the\nproposed Merger Consideration of $77.50 per share in cash. Thereafter, at the request of the Board of Directors,\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners rendered Qatalyst Partners\u2019 oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by\ndelivery of a written opinion, to the Board of Directors that, as of the date of such opinion, based upon and subject\nto the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration\nto be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of\nZendesk common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nholders, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP.\u201d\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs, at the request of the Board of Directors, then rendered Goldman Sachs\u2019 oral\nopinion to the\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard of Directors, subsequently confirmed in writing on June 24, 2022, to the effect that, as of June 24, 2022, and\nbased upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the\n$77.50 in cash per share of Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of\nsuch shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders as further\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.\u201d\nOn June 23, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk common stock was $57.95 per share (since October 28, 2021, the date\nof the announcement of the Momentive Transaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately\n27%, the IGV ETF had declined approximately 36%, the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 52%\nand the Zendesk share price had declined approximately 51%).\nRepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton then summarized the terms of the proposed merger agreement and financing\ndocuments compared to the terms previously reviewed, including a reverse termination fee of approximately 6% of\nZendesk\u2019s equity value payable by the Consortium under certain circumstances, the regulatory approvals that would\nbe required in connection with the transaction and the obligations of the parties in the proposed transaction\ndocuments related to such regulatory efforts. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton also provided a summary of a\nproposed retention equity award and severance program to promote the retention of certain key employees during\nthe pendency of a transaction. Following discussion, the members of the Board of Directors and the compensation\ncommittee of the Board of Directors approved the proposed compensation arrangements. After discussion, the Board\nof Directors directed representatives of Wachtell Lipton to discuss with JANA Partners the potential imminent entry\nby Zendesk into definitive agreements with respect to a sale of Zendesk and determine whether JANA Partners\nwould be prepared to enter into an agreement to withdraw its nominations. The Board of Directors recessed the\nmeeting and representatives of Wachtell Lipton contacted counsel for JANA Partners, who expressed JANA\nPartners\u2019 willingness to agree to withdraw its director nomination notice effective as of 5:00 p.m. on June 24, 2022 if\nZendesk were to announce an agreement for a sale of Zendesk at the $77.50 per share cash price no later than the\nopening of market on June 24, 2022.\nThereafter, on June 23, 2022, the Board of Directors reconvened. Following further discussion and deliberation,\nincluding taking into account the factors described below in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201c-Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,\u201d the Board of Directors\nunanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable, fair\nto and in the best interests of Zendesk and its stockholders\u037e (b) approved the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement\u037e (c)\nresolved to recommend that Zendesk stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e and (d) directed that the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by Zendesk stockholders at the Special Meeting.\nFollowing the meeting of the Board of Directors, representatives of the parties executed the Merger Agreement and\nthe other transaction documents early on June 24, 2022.

The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Merger\nConsideration is all cash, which provides Zendesk stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity\nfor their shares of Zendesk common stock and enables Zendesk stockholders to realize value that has been\ncreated by Zendesk and does not expose them to any future risks related to the business or the financial\nmarkets generally, as compared to Zendesk remaining independent (especially when viewed against the\npotential risks and uncertainties inherent in Zendesk\u2019s business, including risks related to changing\nexternal and internal business factors, including a challenging macroeconomic environment and related\nimpacts on key customer segments). Specifically, among other things, the Board of Directors considered:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration represents a premium value for Zendesk stockholders,\nincluding a 34% premium over the closing price of Zendesk common stock as of June 23, 2022, the last\ntrading day before the public announcement of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe trading price of Zendesk common stock since its initial public offering, including the trading price\nsubsequent to the public announcement of the termination of the strategic review process on June 9,\n2022, and the Merger Consideration relative to such prices\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the Merger Consideration represents the highest price that the Consortium was willing\nto pay considering the negotiations between the parties\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration is fixed and that the Merger Consideration will not fluctuate\nbased upon changes in the market price of Zendesk\u2019s publicly traded shares.\n\u2022\nValue Relative to Standalone Prospects of Zendesk. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the\nMerger Consideration compares favorably to the potential value of Zendesk and Zendesk common stock if\nZendesk were to remain as a standalone entity after taking into account the significant risks and\nuncertainties associated with this alternative, in light of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nZendesk\u2019s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position and historical and projected\nfinancial performance, taking into account negative trends in gross and net bookings momentum, as\nwell as the risk that such trends could persist or worsen, including below expectation gross and net\nbookings actuals for:\n\u2022\nthe first quarter of 2022: actual gross bookings of $136.0 million, which represented year-over-\nyear growth of approximately 6% and fell below the internal outlook of $159.3 million by 15%, and\nnet bookings of $86.6 million, which represented year-over-year growth of approximately 4% and\nfell below the internal outlook of $104.3 million by 17%\u037e\n\u2022\nthe month of April 2022: actual gross bookings of $34.6 million, which represented a year-over-\nyear decline of 7% and fell below the internal outlook of $42.7 million by 19%, and net bookings\nof $16.5 million, which represented a year-over-year decline of approximately 13% and fell below\nthe internal outlook of $20.8 million by 20%\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe month of May 2022: actual gross bookings of $35.7 million, which represented a year-over-\nyear decline of approximately 16% and fell below the internal outlook of $51.6 million by 31%, and\nnet bookings of $16.8 million, which represented a year-over-year decline of approximately 36%\nand fell below the internal outlook of $32.2 million by 48%.\n\u2022\nas a result of the then current business momentum and recessionary concerns, management\nexpectations for fiscal year 2023 revenue based on the June 2022 Case versus the March 2022 Case\ndecreased approximately 10% from $2,172 million to $1,961 million, implying a decline in expected year-\nover-year growth from approximately 27% to approximately 17%, and management expectations for the\nthird quarter, fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 revenues are below street expectations as of June 23,\n2022 by approximately 2%, 4% and 7%, respectively\u037e\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nsignificant compression in valuations of publicly-traded SaaS companies between the announcement\nof the Momentive Transaction on October 28, 2021 and June 23, 2022 (between October 28, 2021 and\nJune 23, 2022, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately 27%, the IGV ETF had\ndeclined approximately 36%, the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 52% and the\nshare price of Zendesk common stock had declined approximately 51%)\u037e\n\u2022\na belief, based on analysis of historical valuation trends, that elevated valuation multiples for publicly-\ntraded SaaS companies over the previous two years were extraordinary and that the recent\ncompression in multiples for the industry could be long-standing\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that, prior to the public announcement of the termination of the strategic review process on\nJune 9, 2022, shares of Zendesk common stock were trading on an \u201caffected basis\u201d and reflected a\npremium driven by takeover speculation and that the share price following the public announcement\nmore accurately reflected the fundamental value of Zendesk common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nrecent market volatility related to the evolving macroeconomic headwinds facing Zendesk and its\nindustry more generally, including increased risk of recession, persistent high inflation and the impact\nof changed economic circumstances on key customer segments\u037e\n\u2022\nthe strategic alternatives reasonably available to Zendesk on a standalone basis, and the risks and\nuncertainties associated with those alternatives\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and uncertainties relating to Zendesk\u2019s efforts to develop and market new products\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and uncertainties related to increased competition in the markets in which Zendesk competes\nor may compete in the future\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that Zendesk\u2019s competitors may be more successful in attracting talent and resources\nand the negative result that such competitive pressure may have on the ability of Zendesk to execute\non its core business objectives, including as evidenced by elevated levels of attrition in Zendesk\u2019s\ncritical sales function and the resulting negative impact on execution.\n\u2022\nThe Sale Process. The Board of Directors also considered:\n\u2022\nthat an extensive review of strategic alternatives was conducted and that Zendesk, with the assistance\nof Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs, actively solicited interest in potential transactions from both\nstrategic and financial sponsors, including with those parties that were believed to be the most able\nand willing to transact, as more fully described above in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-\nBackground of the Merger\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthat of the 26 potential bidders (including and counting the members of the Consortium and their\npotential co-investors as one bidder) contacted, 11 bidders (including and counting the members of\nthe Consortium and their potential co-investors as one bidder) entered into non-disclosure\nagreements with Zendesk, and 10 of these 11 bidders (including and counting the members of the\nConsortium and their potential co-investors as one bidder) attended initial meetings with\nrepresentatives of Zendesk management and were granted due diligence access to Zendesk\u037e\n\u2022\nthat only two of the potential bidders (including and counting the members of the Consortium and\ntheir potential co-investors as one bidder) that engaged in discussions regarding a potential\nacquisition of Zendesk submitted an indication of interest with regard to the acquisition of Zendesk\nand that only the Consortium submitted a definitive proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the strategic review process, even after media coverage regarding Zendesk\u2019s discussions\nwith potentially interested parties, did not result in any proposals to acquire Zendesk that the Board\nof Directors believed were more likely to create greater value and certainty of value for the Zendesk\nstockholders than the Merger\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Consortium\u2019s indication to the Board of Directors that the Merger Consideration of $77.50 per\nshare was the highest price they were willing to offer, and that such offer had been increased\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbecause of the negotiating efforts of the Board of Directors and Zendesk\u2019s advisors, and the Board of\nDirectors\u2019 belief, after discussion with its advisors and based on the course of negotiations with the\nConsortium, that $77.50 per share was the maximum price that the Consortium would offer.\n\u2022\nNegotiation Process. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement\nwere informed by the advice and professional experience of Zendesk\u2019s advisors and the result of robust\nnegotiations.\n\u2022\nStockholder Feedback. The Board of Directors considered the feedback from JANA Partners and other\nsignificant Zendesk stockholders received in engagements during the course of the strategic review\nprocess. Feedback from significant Zendesk stockholders indicated a preference that Zendesk pursue a\nsale process and, to the extent a comprehensive process was completed, provide Zendesk stockholders\nwith the opportunity to make a decision regarding any actionable proposals received.\n\u2022\nOpinion of Financial Advisors. The Board of Directors considered the oral opinion of (a) Qatalyst Partners,\nsubsequently confirmed in writing, to the Board of Directors that, as of the date of such opinion, based\nupon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein,\nthe Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger\nAgreement by the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent)\nwas fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as further described in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP,\u201d and the full text of the opinion, which is attached as\nAnnex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety and\n(b) Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, dated June 24, 2022, to the\neffect that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the various factors,\nassumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the $77.50 in cash per share of\nZendesk common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares\npursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders as further\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,\u201d and the\nfull text of the opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated by\nreference in this proxy statement in its entirety.\n\u2022\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors considered the terms and conditions of the Merger\nAgreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe provision allowing the Board of Directors to change its recommendation prior to obtaining\nstockholder approval of the Merger in specified circumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or\nIntervening Event, subject to Parent\u2019s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment\nof the termination fee of $254 million\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision allowing the Board of Directors to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a\nSuperior Proposal, subject to certain conditions (including payment of the termination fee of $254\nmillion and certain rights of Parent to match the Superior Proposal)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board of Directors\u2019 belief, after discussion with Zendesk\u2019s advisors, that the $254 million\ntermination fee, which constitutes approximately 2.5% of Zendesk\u2019s equity value in the Merger, would\nnot preclude a Superior Proposal from being made\u037e\n\u2022\nParent having obtained committed debt and preferred equity financing from reputable financial\ninstitutions and committed equity financing from affiliated funds of the members of the Consortium in\nan aggregate amount, together with Zendesk\u2019s cash on hand, sufficient to fund the required amounts\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision obligating Parent to use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things\nnecessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing and Equity Financing on\nterms (subject to certain exceptions) and conditions described in the commitment letters\u037e\n\u2022\nthe termination fee of $610 million that may be owed by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement\nunder certain circumstances, and the fact that affiliates of the members of the Consortium provided fee\nfunding agreements with respect to their portion of the payment of such termination fee, as\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwell as certain associated enforcement costs and certain other reimbursement obligations that may be\nowed by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in each case subject to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement and the Fee Funding Agreements\u037e\n\u2022\nthe likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, including the limited number and nature of the\nconditions to complete the Merger (including regulatory conditions), and the provisions of the\nMerger Agreement requiring Parent to use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all\nactions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable under the Merger\nAgreement and applicable law to obtain as expeditiously as possible all consents, registrations,\napprovals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be\nobtained from any third party or any governmental entity to consummate the Merger or any of the\nother transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe availability of statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the Merger.\n\u2022\nOpportunity for Zendesk Stockholders to Vote. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Merger\nwould be subject to the approval of Zendesk stockholders, and Zendesk stockholders would be free to\nevaluate the Merger and vote for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.\n\u2022\nTiming of Completion. The Board of Directors considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of\nthe Merger and concluded that the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly\nmanner. The Board of Directors also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable\ntimeframe could reduce the period during which Zendesk\u2019s business would be subject to the potential\nuncertainty of closing and related disruption.\n\u2022\nOperating Flexibility. The fact that the Merger Agreement provides Zendesk sufficient operating flexibility\nto conduct its business in the ordinary course until the earlier of the consummation of the Merger and the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement (as more fully described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conduct of\nBusiness Pending the Merger\u201d).\n\u2022\nSpecific Performance. Zendesk\u2019s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek\nspecific performance of Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent\nother breaches of the Merger Agreement.\nIn the course of their deliberations, the Board of Directors also considered certain risks and other potentially negative\nfactors concerning the Merger, including:\n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Board of Directors considered the fact\nthat the nature of the Merger as an all-cash transaction means that Zendesk would no longer exist as an\nindependent public company following the consummation of the Merger and that Zendesk stockholders\nwill not participate in future earnings or growth of Parent and will not benefit from any appreciation in value\nof the Surviving Corporation.\n\u2022\nClosing Conditions and Financing. The Board of Directors considered the fact that there can be no\nassurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied even if\nthe Merger Agreement is adopted by Zendesk stockholders, as well as the risk that the Financing\ncontemplated by the Commitment Letters will not be obtained, resulting in Parent and Merger Sub not\nhaving sufficient funds to complete the Merger, or that Parent and Merger Sub may otherwise not obtain\nsufficient funds to complete the Merger.\n\u2022\nRisks Associated with Parent and Merger Sub. The Board of Directors considered the fact that Parent and\nMerger Sub are newly formed entities with essentially no assets and the Fee Funding Agreements,\nprovided by each of the Equity Financing Sources, guarantees Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligations\nunder the Merger Agreement only with respect to payment of the termination fee of $610 million payable by\nParent, certain associated enforcement costs and certain other indemnification and reimbursement\nobligations.\n\u2022\nInterim Operating Risks. The Board of Directors considered the restrictions placed on the conduct of\nZendesk\u2019s business prior to the completion of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAgreement, which, despite providing sufficient flexibility for Zendesk to operate its business in the\nordinary course, could delay or prevent Zendesk from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or\nany other action it would otherwise take with respect to the operations of Zendesk absent the pending\ncompletion of the Merger.\n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board of Directors considered the\npossibility that the Merger might not be consummated, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated:\n\u2022\nZendesk\u2019s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and\neffort and will have experienced significant distraction from their work during the pendency of the\nMerger\u037e\n\u2022\nZendesk will have incurred significant transaction costs\u037e\n\u2022\nZendesk\u2019s continuing business relationships with customers, vendors, partners and employees may\nbe adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nthe trading price of shares of Zendesk common stock could be materially and adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s perceptions of Zendesk\u2019s prospects could be adversely affected\u037e and\n\u2022\nZendesk could lose key management or other personnel of Zendesk during the pendency of the\nMerger.\n\u2022\nNo Solicitation and Termination Fee. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Merger\nAgreement precludes Zendesk from soliciting or, subject to certain limited exceptions, considering\nAlternative Proposals and requires Zendesk to pay Parent a termination fee of $254 million in certain\ncircumstances.\n\u2022\nRemedies. The Board of Directors considered the fact that Zendesk\u2019s remedies in the event that the Merger\nAgreement is terminated may be limited to the Parent Termination Fee of $610 million, payable by Parent\nunder certain circumstances and certain associated enforcement costs and certain other reimbursement\nobligations, which may be inadequate to compensate Zendesk for any damage caused. In addition, the\nBoard of Directors considered that such termination fee may not be available in all instances where the\nMerger is not consummated and, even if available, rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to\nenforce, and the success of any such action may be uncertain.\n\u2022\nEffects of Transaction Announcement. The Board of Directors considered the potential effects of the public\nannouncement of the Merger Agreement, including potential effects on Zendesk\u2019s ability to attract and\nretain key personnel during the pendency of the Merger, as well as the potential for legal proceedings,\njudgments or settlements following the announcement of the Merger and the associated costs, burden and\ninconvenience involved in defending those proceedings, judgments and settlements.\n\u2022\nTiming Risks. The Board of Directors considered the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger,\nincluding that completion of the Merger depends on factors outside of Zendesk\u2019s or the Consortium\u2019s\ncontrol (including the approval of the Merger by Zendesk stockholders and certain governmental\nauthorities), and the risk that the pendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following the\nannouncement of the execution of the Merger Agreement could divert Zendesk management\u2019s attention\nand have an adverse impact on Zendesk, including its client and other business relationships.\n\u2022\nTaxable Consideration. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the exchange of Zendesk common\nstock for cash in the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\u2022\nOther Risks. The Board of Directors considered the other risks described in and incorporated by reference\nin this proxy statement, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Zendesk\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2021, as amended, incorporated by reference herein and the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Board of Directors concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger\nwere outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger.\nIn addition to considering the factors described above, the Board of Directors also considered that some of\nZendesk\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of\nZendesk stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of these interests and considered them at the time\nit approved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation to Zendesk stockholders. For more information,\nplease see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Interests of Zendesk\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the\nMerger.\u201d The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is not\nintended to be exhaustive, but includes the material positive and negative factors considered by the Board of\nDirectors. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the complexity of\nthese matters, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative\nweights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual\ndirectors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board of Directors did not undertake to make any\nspecific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or\ndid not support its ultimate determination. The Board of Directors based its unanimous recommendation on the\ntotality of the information presented, including the factors described above. This explanation of the reasoning of the\nBoard of Directors and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read\nin light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOpinion of Qatalyst Partners LP\nZendesk retained Qatalyst Partners to act as one of its financial advisors in connection with a potential transaction\nsuch as the Merger and to evaluate whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance\nwith, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or\nany affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Zendesk selected Qatalyst Partners to\nact as Zendesk\u2019s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of\nthe business and affairs of Zendesk and the industry in which it operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written\nconsent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement.

Qatalyst Partners delivered\nits written opinion, dated June 23, 2022, to the Board of Directors following the meeting of the Board of Directors.\nThe full text of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 written opinion, dated June 23, 2022, is attached hereto as Annex B and is\nincorporated by reference herein.

It\ndoes not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Zendesk common stock should vote with\nrespect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Zendesk common\nstock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, certain related documents and\ncertain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Zendesk. Qatalyst\nPartners also reviewed the June 2022 Case prepared by Zendesk management, described in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c-Certain Financial Projections.\u201d Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current\noperations and financial condition and the prospects of Zendesk with senior\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmanagement of Zendesk. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Zendesk\ncommon stock and compared the financial performance of Zendesk and the prices and trading activity of Zendesk\ncommon stock with that of certain other selected publicly traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst\nPartners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and\nperformed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Qatalyst\nPartners deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy\nand completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or\ndiscussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Zendesk. With respect to the June 2022 Case, Qatalyst Partners was advised by\nZendesk management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based on discussions with Zendesk management and the\nBoard of Directors, that the June 2022 Case had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently\navailable estimates and judgments of Zendesk management of the future financial performance of Zendesk and other\nmatters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the terms of the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by\nQatalyst Partners would not differ materially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger will be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or\ndelay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the\nMerger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on\nZendesk or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the Merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any\nindependent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Zendesk or its affiliates,\nnor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied,\nwithout independent verification, upon the assessment of Zendesk management as to the existing and future\ntechnology and products of Zendesk and the risks associated with such technology and products.

Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion does not address the\nunderlying business decision of Zendesk to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to\nany strategic alternatives that may be available to Zendesk. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is limited to the fairness, from\na financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of\nthe Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of\nParent), and Qatalyst Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the\ncompensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of Zendesk or any of its affiliates, or any class of such\npersons, relative to such consideration.\nThe following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its\nopinion dated June 23, 2022. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering\nany portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion. For purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners\nutilized, among other things, the June 2022 Case, described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Certain\nFinancial Projections.\u201d Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular\nformat. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used\nby Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set\nforth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies\nand assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners\u2019\nfinancial analyses.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of\npotential per-share present values for Zendesk common stock as of March 31, 2022 (which is the end of Zendesk\u2019s\nmost recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet date) by:\n\u2022\nadding:\n\u2022\nthe implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows excluding the impact of\nstock-based compensation (which are referred to as the \u201cUFCF\u201d) of Zendesk, based on the June 2022\nCase for the second quarter of calendar year 2022 through calendar year 2026 (which implied present\nvalue was calculated using a range of discount rates of 9.5% to 13.0%, based on an estimated\nweighted average cost of capital for Zendesk)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Zendesk, calculated by multiplying\nZendesk\u2019s estimated UFCF excluding the impact of stock-based compensation in calendar year 2027 of\napproximately $815 million, based on the June 2022 Case, by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to\nnext-twelve-months\u2019 estimated UFCF multiples of 16.0x to 25.0x (which were chosen based on Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 professional judgment and experience), and discounted to present value using the same\nrange of discount rates used in the first bullet above\u037e\n\u2022\nthe cash and cash equivalents of Zendesk as of March 31, 2022, as provided by Zendesk\nmanagement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe implied net present value of estimated federal tax savings due to its net operating losses and\nresearch and development tax credits for calendar years 2028 and beyond, discounted to present value\nusing the same range of discount rates used in the first bullet above\u037e and\n\u2022\nsubtracting:\n\u2022\nthe face value of Zendesk\u2019s outstanding convertible debt as of March 31, 2022, as provided by\nZendesk management\u037e and\n\u2022\ndividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Zendesk common stock outstanding\n(calculated using the treasury stock method and excluding approximately 371,000 restricted stock units to\nbe issued under Zendesk\u2019s proposed $28.75 million retention pool), adjusted for restricted stock units,\nperformance stock units, stock options and in-the-money convertible notes (calculated using the net share\nsettlement method and excluding any make-whole shares or other change of control adjustments), all as\nprovided by Zendesk management as of June 22, 2022, with each of the above-referenced estimated future\nUFCFs, terminal value and federal tax savings due to net operating losses and research and development\ntax credits for calendar years 2028 and beyond having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated\ndilution to current stockholders through each respective applicable period (which totaled approximately\n21% in the case of the terminal value) due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations\nrelated to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Zendesk\nmanagement.\nBased on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for Zendesk common stock of\napproximately $58.27 to $96.42 per share.\nSelected Companies Analysis\nQatalyst Partners reviewed and compared selected financial information and public market multiples for Zendesk with\npublicly available financial information and public market multiples for selected companies. The companies used in\nthis comparison were those companies listed below, which were selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional\njudgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of business to Zendesk,\nhave a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have other relevant or similar characteristics.\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates as of June 23, 2022 and using the closing prices as of\nJune 23, 2022 for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the fully-diluted\nenterprise value divided by the estimated consensus revenue for calendar year 2023 (which are referred to as the\n\u201cCY2023E revenue multiples\u201d), for each of the selected companies, as shown below:\nSelected Companies\nCY2023E Revenue\nMultiple\nAdobe Inc.\n8.8x\nIntuit Inc.\n7.7x\nFive9 Inc.\n7.6x\nBlackLine, Inc.\n7.5x\nInstructure Holdings, Inc.\n7.0x\nHubSpot, Inc.\n6.9x\nAvalara, Inc.\n6.6x\nCoupa Software Incorporated\n6.3x\nZoom Video Communications, Inc.\n6.1x\nWorkday, Inc.\n5.0x\nDocuSign, Inc.\n4.9x\nSalesforce.com, inc.\n4.7x\nQualtrics, LLC\n4.5x\nFreshworks Inc.\n4.2x\nBox, Inc.\n4.0x\nTeamViewer AG\n4.0x\nDropbox, Inc.\n3.6x\nRingCentral, Inc.\n2.9x\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E revenue multiples for the selected companies and the application of its\nprofessional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 3.0x to 6.0x.\nQatalyst Partners then applied this range to Zendesk\u2019s estimated revenue for calendar year 2023, based on the June\n2022 Case. Based on the fully diluted shares of Zendesk common stock outstanding as of June 22, 2022 (calculated\nutilizing the same methodology as used in the above section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Discounted Cash Flow\nAnalysis\u201d), this analysis implied a range of values for Zendesk common stock of approximately $47.29 to $91.92 per\nshare.\nNo company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Zendesk. In evaluating the selected\ncompanies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control\nof Zendesk, such as the impact of competition on Zendesk\u2019s business and the industry in general, industry growth\nand the absence of any material adverse change in Zendesk\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in\nthe financial markets in general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic\nmean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nQatalyst Partners compared forty selected public company transactions, including transactions involving companies\nparticipating in similar lines of business to Zendesk or with similar business models, similar financial performance or\nother relevant or similar characteristics.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (a) the implied\nfully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of last-twelve-months\u2019 revenue of the target\ncompany (which are referred to as the \u201cLTM revenue multiples\u201d) and (b) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of\nthe target company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the next-twelve-months\u2019\nrevenue of the target company (which are referred to as the \u201cNTM revenue multiples\u201d).\nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nLTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nNTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\n12/01/20\nSlack Technologies, Inc.\nSalesforce, Inc.\n37.4x\n29.0x\n03/20/18\nMuleSoft, Inc.\nSalesforce, Inc.\n21.8x\n15.7x\n04/11/22\nSailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n15.7x\n13.3x\n06/06/22\nAnaplan, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n16.0x\n12.8x*\n10/15/18\nSendGrid, Inc.\nTwilio Inc.\n14.3x\n11.5x\n06/10/19\nTableau Software, Inc.\nSalesforce, Inc.\n13.2x\n10.9x\n07/26/21\nMedallia, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n13.0x\n10.8x\n09/18/14\nConcur Technologies, Inc.\nSAP SE\n12.6x\n10.2x\n04/26/21\nProofpoint, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n10.8x\n9.4x\n10/28/18\nRed Hat, Inc.\nInternational Business Machines Corporation\n10.8x\n9.3x\n07/28/16\nNetSuite Inc.\nOracle Corporation\n11.8x\n9.1x\n06/01/16\nDemandware, Inc.\nSalesforce, Inc.\n11.2x\n8.9x\n08/19/21\nInovalon Holdings, Inc.\nNordic Capital Limited\n10.0x\n8.8x\n12/07/21\nMimecast Limited\nPermira Holdings Limited\n10.0x\n8.8x\n12/03/11\nSuccessFactors, Inc.\nSAP SE\n10.9x\n8.7x\n03/08/21\nPluralsight, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n9.8x\n8.4x\n02/04/19\nThe Ultimate Software Group, Inc.\nInvestor Group led by Hellman & Friedman, LLC\n10.0x\n8.4x\n04/11/22\nDatto Holding Corp.\nKaseya Inc. & Insight Partners, LLC\n9.7x\n8.3x\n01/29/18\nCallidus Software Inc.\nSAP SE\n9.8x\n8.3x\n12/21/20\nRealPage, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n9.1x\n8.2x\n12/17/17\nAconex Limited\nOracle Corporation\n9.4x\n8.1x\n05/22/12\nAriba, Inc.\nSAP SE\n8.8x\n7.8x\n06/12/19\nMedidata Solutions, Inc.\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes SE\n8.8x\n7.5x\n03/10/21\nTalend S.A.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n8.5x\n7.4x\n11/11/18\nApptio Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n8.1x\n7.0x\n12/20/13\nResponsys, Inc.\nOracle Corporation\n8.1x\n6.9x\n12/24/18\nMINDBODY, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n7.8x\n6.7x\n04/18/16\nCvent, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n8.0x\n6.5x\n06/04/13\nExactTarget, Inc.\nSalesforce, Inc.\n7.9x\n6.5x\n12/04/19\nInstructure Holdings, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n7.7x\n6.5x\n08/01/16\nFleetmatics Group PLC\nVerizon Communications, Inc.\n7.6x\n6.3x\n10/24/11\nRightNow Technologies, Inc.\nOracle Corporation\n7.4x\n6.2x\n05/31/16\nMarketo, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n7.5x\n5.9x\n02/09/12\nTaleo Corporation\nOracle Corporation\n6.3x\n5.3x\n10/23/17\nBroadSoft, Inc.\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n5.3x\n4.6x\n06/15/15\nDealerTrack Technologies, Inc.\nCox Automotive, Inc.\n4.9x\n4.1x\n05/18/16\ninContact, Inc.\nNICE Ltd.\n4.2x\n3.6x\n08/27/12\nKenexa Corporation\nInternational Business Machines Corporation\n4.0x\n3.3x\n07/01/11\nBlackboard Inc.\nProvidence Equity Partners L.L.C.\n3.7x\n3.2x\n11/02/15\nConstant Contact, Inc.\nEndurance International Group Holdings, Inc.\n2.6x\n2.3x\n*\nBased on the total consideration payable by Thoma Bravo, L.P. for Anaplan, Inc. as of June 2022.\nBased on the analysis of the LTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment,\nQatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 6.3x to 13.2x then applied this range to Zendesk\u2019s last-\ntwelve months\u2019 revenue (calculated as the four quarters ended on March 31, 2022). Based on the fully diluted shares\nof Zendesk common stock outstanding as of June 22, 2022 (calculated utilizing the same\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmethodology as used in the above section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,\u201d with\nthe exception of assuming cash settlement of the convertible notes with an assumed make-whole adjustment and\ncash settlement of the capped calls based on a Black-Scholes option calculation model, each based on an assumed\nSeptember 30, 2022 closing date for the Merger), as provided by Zendesk management, this analysis implied a range\nof values for Zendesk common stock of approximately $71.56 to $142.65 per share.\nBased on the analysis of the NTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment,\nQatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 5.3x to 10.9x then applied this range to Zendesk\u2019s\nestimated next-twelve-months\u2019 revenue (calculated as the four quarters ending on March 31, 2023) based on the June\n2022 Case. Based on the same fully diluted share count as used in the immediately preceding paragraph, this analysis\nimplied a range of values for Zendesk common stock of approximately $73.58 to $144.03 per share.\nNo company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Zendesk or the Merger. In\nevaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry\nperformance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are\nbeyond Zendesk\u2019s control, such as the impact of competition on Zendesk\u2019s business or the industry generally,\nindustry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in Zendesk\u2019s financial condition and prospects or\nthe industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and\nthe aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical\nanalysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of\nusing selected transactional data. Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the Merger,\nQatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.\nMiscellaneous\nIn connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of\nfinancial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a\ncomplex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its\nopinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular\nweight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses,\nwithout considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying\nits analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given various analyses and factors more or less\nweight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other\nassumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not\nbe taken to be Qatalyst Partners\u2019 view of the actual value of Zendesk. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners\nmade numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Zendesk. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or\nless favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nQatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of\nthe Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of\nParent), to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price at which Zendesk\ncommon stock might actually trade at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors considered by the\nBoard of Directors in deciding to approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above\nshould not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board of Directors with respect to the Merger\nConsideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders\nof shares of Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) or of whether the Board of Directors\nwould have been willing to agree to a different consideration. The Merger Consideration payable in the Merger was\ndetermined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Zendesk and Parent and was approved by the Board of\nDirectors. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Zendesk during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not,\nhowever, recommend any specific consideration to Zendesk or that any specific consideration constituted the only\nappropriate consideration for the Merger.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,\ndomestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these\nactivities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise\neffect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Zendesk, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.\nDuring the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion, no material relationship existed between\nQatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and Zendesk or any member of the Consortium (Permira, H&F, Significant LP\nCo-Investor B and Significant LP Co-Investor C) or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst\nPartners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners has provided financial advisory services to Permira and received a fee of\n$15 million in connection with such services. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide\ninvestment banking and other financial services to Zendesk or Parent and their respective affiliates for which\nQatalyst Partners would expect to receive compensation.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided Zendesk with financial advisory services in\nconnection with the Merger for which it will be paid an aggregate amount currently estimated at approximately $56\nmillion, $250,000 of which was payable upon the execution of the engagement letter, $5 million of which was\npayable upon delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), $2 million of which was\npayable upon the resolution of the proxy contest with JANA Partners, and the remaining portion of which will be\npaid upon, and subject to, the closing of the Merger. Zendesk has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its\nexpenses incurred in performing its services. Zendesk has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its\naffiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person controlling\nQatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities\nlaws, and certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 engagement.\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nAt the meeting of the Board of Directors on June 23, 2022, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Board of\nDirectors, subsequently confirmed in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, dated June 24, 2022, to the effect that, as of the\ndate of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth\ntherein, the $77.50 in cash per share of Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its\naffiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated June 24, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex C. The summary of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion contained in this proxy\nstatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion. Goldman Sachs\nprovided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors in connection\nwith its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of\nshares of Zendesk common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman\nSachs reviewed, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Zendesk for the five fiscal years\nended December 31, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Zendesk\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for Zendesk\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain other communications from Zendesk to its stockholders\u037e and\n\u2022\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Zendesk (which forecasts are referred to as the June\n2022 Case and summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Certain Financial Projections\u201d)\n(including a schedule of expected utilization of net operating loss carryforwards by Zendesk) prepared by\nZendesk management, as approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Zendesk, which we refer to as the\n\u201cForecasts\u201d in this section of this proxy statement.\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Zendesk regarding their\nassessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Zendesk\u037e\nreviewed the reported price and trading activity for Zendesk common stock\u037e compared certain financial and stock\nmarket information for Zendesk with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are\npublicly traded\u037e reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the software industry and in\nother industries\u037e and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as Goldman\nSachs deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Board of Directors, relied upon and\nassumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information\nprovided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent\nverification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Board of Directors that the\nForecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of Zendesk\nmanagement. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities\n(including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Zendesk or any of its\nsubsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed\nthat all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger\nwould be obtained without any adverse effect on Zendesk or on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way\nmeaningful to Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the Merger would be consummated on the\nterms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of\nwhich would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Zendesk to engage in the Merger, or\nthe relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Zendesk\u037e nor does\nit address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion addressed only the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view, as of the date of its written opinion, of the $77.50 in cash per share of Zendesk common stock\nto be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger\nAgreement or the Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or any\nconsideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of Zendesk\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable\nto any of the officers, directors or employees of Zendesk, or any class of such persons in connection with the\nMerger, whether relative to the $77.50 in cash per share of Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders of such\nshares (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\nwas necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made\navailable to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of the written opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for\nupdating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date\nof its written opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of\nZendesk common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock\nmarkets on Zendesk, Parent or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of Zendesk\nor Parent or the ability of Zendesk or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs\u2019\nopinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board of Directors in\nconnection with rendering to the Board of Directors the opinion described above. The following summary, however,\ndoes not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the\norder of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some\nof the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read\ntogether with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial\nanalyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market\ndata, is based on market data as it existed on or before June 23, 2022, the last trading day before the public\nannouncement of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current or future market conditions.\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nImplied Premia Analysis\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia and multiples described below based on the $77.50 in\ncash per share of Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares\npursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $77.50 in cash per share of Zendesk common stock\nrelative to:\n\u2022\n$57.95, the closing price for Zendesk common stock on June 23, 2022, the last full trading day prior to\nsigning the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the \u201cCurrent Share Price\u201d in this section of this proxy\nstatement)\u037e\n\u2022\n$153.43, the highest trading price of Zendesk common stock over the 52-week period ended June 23, 2022\n(which we refer to as the \u201c52-Week High\u201d in this section of this proxy statement)\u037e\n\u2022\n$54.16, the lowest trading price of Zendesk common stock over the 52-week period ended June 23, 2022\n(which we refer to as the \u201c52-Week Low\u201d in this section of this proxy statement)\u037e\n\u2022\n$59.28, the average closing trading price of Zendesk common stock since the conclusion of the strategic\nreview process was announced pre-market on June 9, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201cPost-Strategic Review\nPrice\u201d in this section of this proxy statement\u037e\n\u2022\n$76.42, the average closing trading price of Zendesk common stock over the one-month period ended June\n23, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201c1-Month Average\u201d in this section of this proxy statement)\u037e and\n\u2022\n$102.81, the average closing trading price of Zendesk common stock over the three-month period ended\nJune 23, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201c3-Month Average\u201d in this section of this proxy statement).\nThe results of these calculations and comparisons were as follows:\nCommon Stock Reference Price\nImplied Premium\nRepresented by \n$77.50 in Cash per Share of\nZendesk Common Stock\nCurrent Share Price of $57.95\n34%\n52-Week High of $153.43\n(49)%\n52-Week Low of $54.16\n43%\nPost-Strategic Review Price of $59.28\n31%\n1-Month Average of $76.42\n1%\n3-Month Average of $102.81\n(25)%\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nUsing the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis of Zendesk. Using a\nmid-year discounting convention and discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 12.0%, reflecting estimates of Zendesk\u2019s\nweighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of March 31, 2022 (a) estimates of\nthe unlevered free cash flows (excluding the impact of net operating losses), which are referred to as \u201cUFCF,\u201d for the\nsecond, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022 and fiscal years 2023 through 2030 as reflected in the Forecasts,\nand (b) a range of illustrative terminal values for Zendesk, which were calculated by applying exit terminal year, next\ntwelve months\u2019, which we refer to as \u201cNTM,\u201d UFCF multiples ranging from 20.0x to 32.5x, to a terminal year NTM\nUFCF, to be generated by Zendesk, as reflected in the Forecasts (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates\nranging from 5.0% to 8.9%). Goldman Sachs derived the discount rates referenced above by application of the Capital\nAsset Pricing Model, which is referred to as \u201cCAPM,\u201d which requires certain company-specific inputs, including\nZendesk\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and\na beta for Zendesk, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The\nillustrative terminal value to NTM UFCF multiple\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrange for Zendesk was derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into\naccount, among other things, enterprise value over NTM UFCF as of June 23, 2022 of certain publicly traded\ncompanies, as described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Selected Public Company\nComparables.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Zendesk by adding the ranges of present values it\nderived as described in the immediately preceding paragraph. Goldman Sachs then added to the range of illustrative\nenterprise values it derived for Zendesk the amount of net cash of Zendesk as of March 31, 2022 and the net present\nvalue of net operating losses as reflected in the Forecasts, in each case, as provided by Zendesk management and\napproved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Zendesk management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for\nZendesk. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted\noutstanding shares of Zendesk common stock, calculated using the treasury stock method, as provided by Zendesk\nmanagement and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Zendesk management, to derive a range of illustrative present\nvalues per share of Zendesk common stock ranging from $66 to $116, rounded to the nearest dollar.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price\nGoldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share\nof Zendesk common stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2022\nthrough 2025. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value per share of Zendesk common stock as of\nDecember 31, for each of the fiscal years 2022 through 2024, by applying multiples of enterprise value to NTM\nrevenue, which we refer to as \u201cEV/NTM revenue\u201d in this section of this proxy statement, of 4.5x to 8.0x to estimates\nof Zendesk\u2019s revenue for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025. These illustrative EV/NTM revenue multiple estimates\nwere derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and\nhistorical EV/NTM revenue multiples for Zendesk during the six-month, one-year, three-year and five-year periods\nending June 23, 2022, as described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Historical EV/NTM Trading\nMultiples.\u201d Goldman Sachs then added the amount of Zendesk\u2019s forecasted net cash as of December 31 for each of\nthe fiscal years 2022 to 2024, as provided by Zendesk management, from the respective implied enterprise values in\norder to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Zendesk. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the\nnumber of projected year-end fully diluted outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock for each of the fiscal years\n2022 to 2024, calculated based on estimated annual dilution and the number of fully diluted shares of Zendesk\ncommon stock estimated to be outstanding as of June 22, 2022, calculated using the treasury stock method, each as\nprovided and approved by Zendesk management. Goldman Sachs then discounted the implied per share future equity\nvalues for the twelve-month periods ending on December 31, 2022, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively, back to March 31, 2022, using an illustrative discount rate of 10.9%, reflecting an estimate of Zendesk\u2019s\ncost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of CAPM, which requires certain company-\nspecific inputs, including a beta for the company as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial\nmarkets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Zendesk common stock of\n$64 to $124, rounded to the nearest dollar.\nGoldman Sachs also performed an illustrative present value of future share price analysis, by calculating the implied\nenterprise values per share of Zendesk common stock as of December 31, for each of the fiscal years 2022 through\n2024, by applying enterprise value to growth-adjusted EV/NTM revenue multiples adjusted using NTM revenue\ngrowth, of 0.2375x to 0.3500x to NTM revenue estimates and NTM revenue growth for Zendesk for each of the fiscal\nyears 2023 to 2025. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2022 through\n2025. These illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and\nexperience, taking into account current and historical growth-adjusted EV/NTM revenue multiples for Zendesk, as\ndescribed below in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Historical EV/NTM Trading Multiples.\u201d Goldman\nSachs then added the amount of Zendesk\u2019s forecasted net cash as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2022 to\n2024, as provided by Zendesk management, from the respective implied enterprise values in order to derive a range of\nillustrative equity values for Zendesk. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the number of projected year-end\nfully diluted outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, calculated based\non estimated annual dilution and the number of fully diluted shares of Zendesk common stock estimated to be\noutstanding as of June 22, 2022, calculated using the treasury stock method, each as provided and approved by\nZendesk management. Goldman\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSachs then discounted the implied per share future equity values for the twelve-month periods ending on December\n31, 2022, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively, back to March 31, 2022, using an illustrative\ndiscount rate of 10.9%, reflecting an estimate of Zendesk\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate\nby application of CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as\ncertain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied\npresent values per share of Zendesk common stock of $58 to $119, rounded to the nearest dollar.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis\nGoldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions in the\nsoftware industry since 2016. For each of the selected transactions where information was publicly available,\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied EV/NTM revenue of the applicable target company based on the\ntotal consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of the target company\u2019s NTM revenue based on Institutional\nBrokers\u2019 Estimate System estimates (which are referred to as \u201cIBES estimates\u201d) at the time each such selected\ntransaction was announced.\nThe following table identifies the transactions reviewed by Goldman Sachs as part of this analysis:\nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nEV/NTM\nRevenue\nApr 2022\nSailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n13.3x\nMar 2022\nAnaplan, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n13.9x*\nJul 2021\nMedallia, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n10.8x\nApr 2021\nNuance Communications, Inc.\nMicrosoft Corporation\n14.2x\nDec 2020\nSlack Technologies, Inc.\nSalesforce.com, inc.\n29.2x\nJun 2019\nTableau Software, Inc.\nSalesforce.com, inc.\n11.0x\nFeb 2019\nThe Ultimate Software Group, Inc.\nHellman & Friedman LLC\n8.3x\nDec 2018\nMINDBODY, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n6.7x\nNov 2018\nQualtrics International Inc.\nSAP SE\n15.0x\nNov 2018\nApptio, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n7.1x\nOct 2018\nSendGrid, Inc.\nTwilio Inc.\n11.5x\nOct 2018\nRed Hat, Inc.\nInternational Business Machines Corporation\n9.4x\nOct 2018\nHortonworks, Inc.\nCloudera, Inc.\n5.3x\nJun 2018\nAdaptive Insights, Inc.\nWorkday, Inc.\n10.9x\nMar 2018\nMuleSoft, Inc.\nSalesforce.com, inc.\n15.7x\nJan 2018\nCallidus Software Inc.\nSAP SE\n8.3x\nJul 2016\nNetSuite Inc.\nOracle Corporation\n9.2x\nJun 2016\nDemandware, Inc.\nSalesforce.com, inc.\n8.9x\nJun 2016\nLinkedIn Corporation\nMicrosoft Corporation\n6.8x\nMay 2016\nMarketo, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n5.9x\nApr 2016\nTextura Corporation\nOracle Corporation\n6.1x\nMedian\n9.4x\n25th Percentile\n7.0x\n75th Percentile\n13.6x\n*\nBased on the total consideration payable by Thoma Bravo, L.P. for Anaplan, Inc. as of March 2022.\nWhile none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to Zendesk, the\ncompanies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations that for purposes of this\nanalysis may be considered similar based on certain characteristics of Zendesk\u2019s results, market size and product\nprofile.\nBased on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs\u2019 analyses of the various transactions and its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs used NTM revenue of $1,811 million, calculated using a time-\nweighting of fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023 as of June 23, 2022, to derive a range of implied\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nenterprise values for Zendesk. Goldman Sachs then added to the range of implied enterprise values the amount of\nZendesk\u2019s net cash as of March 31, 2022, as provided by Zendesk management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019\nuse by Zendesk management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Zendesk. Goldman Sachs divided the\nresults by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock, calculated using the treasury\nstock method, as provided by Zendesk management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Zendesk management,\nto derive a range of implied equity values per share of Zendesk common stock of $98 to $186, rounded to the nearest\ndollar.\nPrecedent M&A Premia\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash\nacquisition transactions announced during the time period from April 2016 through June 2022 involving a public\ncompany in the software industry as the target where the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were greater\nthan $1 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th\npercentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in each of the transactions relative to the target\u2019s last\nundisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium\nof 36% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 20% and 75th percentile premium\nof 56% across the period. Using this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a\nreference range of illustrative premia of 20% to 56% to the closing price per share of Zendesk common stock of $57.95\nas of June 23, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Zendesk common stock of $70 to $90,\nrounded to the nearest dollar.\nHistorical EV/NTM Revenue Multiples\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared EV/NTM revenue multiples and growth-adjusted EV/NTM revenue\nmultiples adjusted using NTM revenue growth for Zendesk based on financial and trading data as of June 23, 2022,\ninformation Goldman Sachs obtained from Bloomberg, publicly available historical data, market data and IBES\nestimates. Goldman Sachs calculated average EV/NTM revenue multiples and average growth-adjusted EV/NTM\nrevenue multiples over certain time periods prior to and including June 23, 2022.\nThe results of these calculations are as follows:\nEV/NTM Revenue Multiple Over Time\nAverage\nZendesk\nSix-Months\n7.2x\nOne-Year\n8.3x\nThree-Year\n9.3x\nFive-Year\n8.7x\nGrowth-Adjusted EV/NTM Revenue Multiple Over Time(1)\nSix-Months\n0.27x\nOne-Year\n0.32x\nThree-Year\n0.35x\nFive-Year\n0.31x\n(1)\nGrowth adjusted using next fiscal year growth as an approximation for NTM revenue growth over time and adjusted to reflect\ncurrent NTM offset.\nSelected Public Company Comparables\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for the following publicly\ntraded corporations, which we refer to in this section of this proxy statement as the \u201ccomparable companies\u201d:\n\u2022\nAdobe Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nDynatrace, Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nMicrosoft Corporation\u037e\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nOracle Corporation\u037e\n\u2022\nSalesforce.com, inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nSAP SE\u037e\n\u2022\nServiceNow, Inc.\u037e and\n\u2022\nWorkday, Inc.\nAlthough none of the comparable companies is directly comparable to Zendesk, the comparable companies were\nchosen because they are mature publicly traded companies in the software industry with operations that for\npurposes of this analysis would be considered similar to certain projected operations of Zendesk.\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared the enterprise value as of June 23, 2022 as a multiple of NTM unlevered free\ncash flow for the comparable companies based on financial and trading data as of June 23, 2022, information Goldman\nSachs obtained from Bloomberg, IBES estimates and publicly available historical and market data.\nThe results of this review is summarized as follows:\nComparable Company\nEV/NTM unlevered free cash\nflow\nAdobe Inc.\n22x\nDynatrace, Inc.\n33x\nMicrosoft Corporation\n25x\nOracle Corporation\n21x\nSalesforce.com, inc.\n24x\nSAP SE\n20x\nServiceNow, Inc.\n37x\nWorkday, Inc.\n26x\nMedian\n24x\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or\nsummary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the\nanalyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In\narriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to\nfairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.\nNo company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Zendesk or the\nMerger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Board of Directors as to the\nfairness from a financial point of view to Zendesk, as of the date of its written opinion, of the $77.50 in cash per share\nof Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at\nwhich businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by\nthese analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Zendesk, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any\nother person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Zendesk and Parent and was\napproved by the Board of Directors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Zendesk during these negotiations. Goldman\nSachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to Zendesk or the Board of Directors or\nthat any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the Board of Directors in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing\nsummary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection\nwith the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached\nas Annex C to this proxy statement.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and\ntrading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various\npersons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in\nwhich they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold\nor vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit\ndefault swaps and other financial instruments of Zendesk, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties,\nincluding Permira and H&F, each of which is an affiliate of a significant equityholder of Parent, and any of their\nrespective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in\nthe Merger or other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nGoldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Zendesk in connection with, and participated in certain of the\nnegotiations leading to, the Merger. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting\nservices to Zendesk and its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs\nhas received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as bookrunner with respect to the public\noffering by Zendesk of 2025 Convertible Notes (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Capped\nCall Transactions\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $1.15 billion in June 2020. During the two-year period ended\nJune 24, 2022, Goldman Sachs has not recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services\nprovided by its Investment Banking Division to Zendesk and/or its affiliates.\nAs further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Capped Call Transactions,\u201d in March 2018,\nZendesk offered its 2023 Convertible Notes (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Capped Call\nTransactions\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $575 million, with respect to which Goldman Sachs acted as\nbookrunner and, concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible Notes (as defined in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c-Capped Call Transactions\u201d), Zendesk entered into the Capped Call Transactions with the Capped\nCall Counterparties (each as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Capped Call Transactions\u201d),\nincluding Goldman Sachs (with respect to 50% of the 2023 Convertible Notes and 20% of the 2025 Convertible Notes,\nrespectively), each acting as principal for its own account, consisting of the purchase by Zendesk of capped call\noptions with respect to collectively approximately 4,558,428 shares of Zendesk common stock from the 2023\nConvertible Notes and 2,114,712 shares of Zendesk common stock from the 2025 Convertible Notes, the aggregate\nnumber of shares of Zendesk common stock underlying the Convertible Notes (at the initial conversion rate of 9.1944\nshares of Zendesk common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes and of 15.8554 shares of\nZendesk common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2023 Convertible Notes). As of July 20, 2022, 100% of the\n2020 Capped Call Transactions (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Capped Call\nTransactions\u201d) remain outstanding, with a strike price of approximately $108.76 and a cap price of $164.17 and\napproximately 26% of the 2018 Capped Call Transactions (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-\nCapped Call Transactions\u201d) remain outstanding, with a strike price of approximately $63.07 and a cap price of $95.20.\nThe Capped Call Transactions were intended to offset a portion of the potential dilutive effect on Zendesk\nstockholders of the conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or any potential cash payment in excess of the principal\namount of the Convertible Notes that Zendesk may make in connection with a cash settlement of the Convertible\nNotes, up to the cap price. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Capped Call Transactions\u201d for a\ndetailed description of the Capped Call Transactions, including Goldman Sachs\u2019 and the other Capped Call\nCounterparties\u2019 ability to adjust the terms of the Capped Call Transactions in connection with certain events\n(including the Merger).\nAs a result of the Capped Call Transactions, the Capped Call Counterparties are expected to have market exposure to\nthe price of the shares of Zendesk common stock. It is the ordinary practice of the Capped Call Counterparties to\nengage in hedging activities to limit their respective market exposure to the price of the stock underlying privately\nnegotiated equity derivative transactions with issuers of such stock, such as the Capped Call Transactions. In\nconnection with the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, Goldman Sachs (and its affiliates) have engaged,\nand will continue to engage, in accordance with applicable law in hedging and other\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmarket transactions (which may include the entering into or unwinding of various derivative transactions with\nrespect to Zendesk common stock) that are generally intended to substantially neutralize Goldman Sachs\u2019 exposure\nas a result of the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party to changes in the price of Zendesk common stock.\nSuch hedging activity is at Goldman Sachs\u2019 own risk and may result in a gain or loss to Goldman Sachs that may be\ngreater than or less than the initial expected contractual benefit to Goldman Sachs under the Capped Call\nTransactions to which it is a party. The amount of any such gain or loss will not be known until the applicable\nCapped Call Transactions have been exercised, expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and Goldman\nSachs shall have completed all of its hedge unwind activities. To mitigate the exposure from the Capped Call\nTransactions, as of July 20, 2022, Goldman Sachs held a net long economic position of approximately 750,000 shares\nof Zendesk common stock.\nGoldman Sachs provided to management of Zendesk, for the information of the Board of Directors, materials that\nsummarized, based on theoretical models, the potential effects of the announcement and of the consummation of an\nacquisition of Zendesk on the Capped Call Transactions. The materials included preliminary illustrative analyses by\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division for a range of stated assumptions regarding takeout prices for shares\nof Zendesk common stock and volatilities, as well as based on other reasonable assumptions, in the event of an\nacquisition of Zendesk for greater than 10 percent cash consideration. In accordance with industry practice, Goldman\nSachs maintains customary institutional information barriers reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized\ndisclosure of confidential information by personnel in its Investment Banking Division to the personnel in its\nSecurities Division who are undertaking hedging and other market transactions with respect to Goldman Sachs\u2019\ncapped call transactions. In connection with the preparation of presentations to senior management of Zendesk and\nthe Board of Directors, personnel in Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division, including the representatives of\nGoldman Sachs who have advised Zendesk in connection with the Merger, from time to time, have received or may\nreceive input from personnel in Goldman Sachs\u2019 Securities Division into how to model, or reports of historical\nmeasures or estimates of, Goldman Sachs\u2019 and/or Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division\u2019s profit and/or loss\nover certain measurement periods related to the Capped Call Transactions.\nGoldman Sachs has advised Zendesk that as of July 20, 2022, assuming the Merger is consummated on July 25, 2022,\nGoldman Sachs expects to realize a net gain of up to approximately $1.4 million with respect to the 2018 Capped Call\nTransactions, and a net gain ranging from approximately $1.1 million to approximately $4.0 million with respect to the\n2020 Capped Call Transactions, in each case, as a result of the Merger, after giving effect to its hedging activities\nbased on the ordinary hedging practices described above and based on a range of stated assumptions, including\nvolatilities (from 35 percent to 70 percent) and other reasonable assumptions. The amount of any such gain will not\nbe known until the Capped Call Transactions have been exercised, expired or terminated in accordance with their\nterms and Goldman Sachs and its affiliates have completed all of their unwind activities, and such amount may differ\nfrom the estimates provided above.

On June 11,\n2020, in connection with the pricing of Zendesk\u2019s 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (which we refer to as the\n\u201c2025 Convertible Notes\u201d and, together with the 2023 Convertible Notes, the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), Zendesk entered\ninto privately negotiated capped call transactions (which we refer to as the \u201c2020 Base Capped Call Transactions\u201d)\nwith each of Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Goldman Sachs, Bank of Montreal, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,\nBarclays Bank PLC or their respective affiliates (which we refer to as the \u201c2020 Capped Call Counterparties\u201d and,\ntogether with the 2018 Capped Call Counterparties, the \u201cCapped Call Counterparties\u201d). On June 12, 2020, in\nconnection with the initial purchasers\u2019 exercise of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, Zendesk\nentered into additional capped call transactions with each of the 2020 Capped Call Counterparties (which we refer to\nas the \u201c2020 Additional Capped Call Transactions\u201d and, together with the 2020 Base Capped Call Transactions, the\n\u201c2020 Capped Call Transactions\u201d, and together with the 2018 Capped Call Transactions, the \u201cCapped Call\nTransactions\u201d). The Capped Call Transactions initially covered, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the\nnumber of shares of Zendesk common stock that initially underlie the applicable Existing Notes (as defined in the\nMerger Agreement). The\n61TABLE OF CONTENTS\nstrike price of the 2018 Capped Call Transactions is $63.07 per share of Zendesk common stock, and the cap price of\nthe 2018 Capped Call Transactions is $95.20 per share of Zendesk common stock, and is subject to certain\nadjustments under the terms of the 2018 Capped Call Transactions.

The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to\nZendesk stockholders upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset the potential cash payments that\nZendesk could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted Convertible Notes upon\nconversion thereof, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price.\nIf the Merger is consummated, holders of the Existing Notes may convert their Existing Notes, and the consummation\nof the Merger is expected to result in termination of the Capped Call Transactions. The value received by the\nCompany in connection with the termination or unwind of the Capped Call Transactions would be determined by the\nCapped Call Counterparties based on the fair value of the Capped Call Transactions, which is contingent on a variety\nof factors including, but not limited to, volatility, spot price and liquidity.\nIn addition, following the announcement of the Merger, the Capped Call Counterparties may adjust the terms of the\napplicable Capped Call Transactions on more than one occasion to reflect the economic effect of such\nannouncement, including if such economic effect is material, and regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.\nEach Capped Call Counterparty shall, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, in its capacity as\ncalculation agent with respect to its Capped Call Transaction, determine whether such announcement has had a\nmaterial economic effect, in the case of the 2020 Capped Call Transactions, or an economic effect in the case of the\n2018 Capped Call Transactions, in either case on such Capped Call Transaction and may take into account a number\nof factors, including the date of the announcement (and the remaining term of its Capped Call Transaction at that\ntime), the stock price of Zendesk common stock and changes in volatility, stock loan rate, liquidity and expected\ndividends of Zendesk common stock, in determining whether an adjustment to the cap price of its Capped Call\nTransaction is appropriate.

The Management Projections were\nalso provided to and used by Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs, Zendesk\u2019s financial advisors, for the purpose of\nperforming financial analyses in connection with the strategic review process and, in the case of the June 2022 Case,\nfor the purpose of evaluating the fairness of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view. As described\nabove, the March 2022 Projections (but not the extrapolations from 2026 to 2031) were also made available to bidders\nin the strategic review process.\nThe Management Projections are not included in this proxy statement to influence any decision on whether to vote\nfor the Merger Agreement Proposal, but rather are included in this proxy statement to give stockholders access to\ncertain non-public information that was provided to the Board of Directors, Zendesk\u2019s financial advisors and Parent\nfor purposes of considering and evaluating the Merger. The inclusion of the Management Projections should not be\nregarded as an indication that the Board of Directors, Zendesk, Parent, or their respective affiliates or financial\nadvisors or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, them to be necessarily predictive of\nactual future results, and they should not be relied on as such. There can be no assurance that the projected results\nwill be realized or that actual results will not be materially lower or higher than estimated, whether or not the Merger is\ncompleted.\nThe Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward\ncompliance with the published guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information, or GAAP, but, in the view of\nZendesk management, were reasonably prepared in good faith on a basis reflecting the best available estimates and\njudgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation. However, this information is not\nfact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily predictive of actual future results, and readers of this proxy\nstatement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Management Projections. Although the Management\nProjections were prepared on a reasonable basis, Zendesk cautions stockholders that actual future results could be\nmaterially different from the Management Projections. Zendesk\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm,\nErnst & Young LLP, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect\nto the Management Projections and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with\nrespect thereto.\nThe Management Projections are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to\ninterpretation. While presented with numerical specificity, the Management Projections are based upon\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\na variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by Zendesk\nmanagement, as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be impacted by any\nnumber of factors, including general economic conditions, trends in the software industry, regulatory and financial\nmarket conditions and the risks and uncertainties described or incorporated by reference in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond\nthe control of Zendesk. The Management Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that\nare subject to change. Because the Management Projections were developed for Zendesk as an independent\ncompany without giving effect to the Merger, they do not reflect any divestitures or other restrictions that may be\nimposed in connection with the receipt of any necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, or any changes to\nZendesk\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after completion of the Merger. There can be no assurance\nthat the Management Projections will be realized, and actual results will likely differ, and may differ materially, from\nthose shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the Management Projections relate, the less predictive the\ninformation becomes.\nThe Management Projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Zendesk management believes are\nhelpful in understanding Zendesk\u2019s past financial performance and future results. Zendesk management regularly\nuses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring\nfinancial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for comparable GAAP measures. While Zendesk believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide\nmeaningful information to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze Zendesk\u2019s financial and\nbusiness trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported\nby all of Zendesk\u2019s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Zendesk\u2019s\ncompetitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise\nrequire a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provided to a board of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed business\ncombination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition,\nreconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the Board of Directors, Parent, or their\nrespective affiliates or financial advisors in connection with their respective evaluations of the Merger. Accordingly,\nZendesk has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Management\nProjections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nNone of Zendesk, Parent, or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives can\nprovide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Management Projections, and, except as required by\napplicable law, none of Zendesk, Parent, or their respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update, or\notherwise revise or reconcile, the Management Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the\nManagement Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all\nof the assumptions underlying the Management Projections are shown to be inappropriate. None of Zendesk or its\naffiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any Zendesk\nstockholder or other person regarding Zendesk\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the\nManagement Projections or that forecasted results will be achieved. Zendesk has made no representation to Parent,\nin the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Management Projections.\nInterests of Zendesk\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, Zendesk\nstockholders should be aware that Zendesk\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may\nbe different from, or in addition to, the interests of Zendesk stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware\nof these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, in\nreaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\n(including the Merger) and in recommending to Zendesk stockholders that the Merger Agreement Proposal be\napproved. Such interests are described below. There are no current or former Zendesk executive officers, other than\nthe Zendesk \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d (as defined below), who have interests in the Merger that are different from,\nor in addition to, the interests of Zendesk stockholders generally.\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in\nthis section, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe relevant price per share of Zendesk common stock is $77.50, which is the Merger Consideration\u037e\n\u2022\nThe Effective Time as referenced in this section of this proxy statement occurred on December 1, 2022,\nwhich is the assumed date of the Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section of this\nproxy statement\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe employment of each executive officer of Zendesk is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d or due to the executive\nofficer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and agreements), in\neither case immediately following the assumed Effective Time.\nThe amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be\naccurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation\nactions that may occur before completion of the Merger. For purposes of the discussion in this section of this proxy\nstatement, \u201csingle trigger\u201d refers to benefits that arise solely as a result of the completion of the Merger and \u201cdouble\ntrigger\u201d refers to benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the Merger and either the\ncompletion of a subsequent, time-based vesting period or a qualifying termination of employment on or following the\nEffective Time.\nTreatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, outstanding Zendesk equity awards\n(including those held by the executive officers of Zendesk) will be treated as follows, subject to all required tax\nwithholdings:\n\u2022\nat the Effective Time, each in-the-money Stock Option that is vested by its terms and outstanding\nimmediately prior to Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive, without interest,\nat the Effective Time, a cash award equal to the Aggregate Option Spread Value of such Stock Option.\n\u2022\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time, each in-the-money Stock Option that is then outstanding and not\nvested by its terms will be canceled and converted as of the Effective Time into a cash award equal to the\nAggregate Option Spread Value of such Stock Option, which will remain subject to the same time-vesting\nterms and conditions that applied to the associated Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,\nincluding the requirement of continued service with the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates through the\napplicable vesting date, as applicable, and the applicable cash amounts will be paid out, without interest,\non the next payroll date following the applicable vesting dates, so long as the applicable portion of the\ncash award became or becomes vested prior to the applicable holder\u2019s termination of service with the\nSurviving Corporation and its affiliates.\n\u2022\nat the Effective Time, each Stock Option (whether vested or unvested) for which the exercise price per share\nis equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled at the Closing (as defined in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Closing and Effective Time\u201d) without payment.\n\u2022\nat the Effective Time, each vested RSU Award will cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares\nof Zendesk common stock, will be canceled and will entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive from\nthe Surviving Corporation, without interest, at the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the Merger\nConsideration in respect of each share underlying such RSU Award.\n\u2022\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time, each unvested RSU Award will be canceled and converted as of the\nEffective Time into a cash award (assuming achievement of performance for performance-based RSU Award\nusing the same formula provided for in the applicable award agreement). Such cash award will equal the\namount of the Merger Consideration in respect of each share underlying such RSU Award and will remain\nsubject to the same time-vesting terms and conditions that applied to such RSU Award (except for any\nperformance-based vesting conditions), immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the requirement\nof continued service with the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates through the applicable vesting date or\nthrough the end of the original performance period, as applicable, and the\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\napplicable cash amounts will be paid out, without interest, on the next payroll date following the applicable\nvesting dates, so long as the applicable portion of the cash award became or becomes vested prior to the\napplicable holder\u2019s termination of service with the Surviving Corporation and its affiliates.\nBased on the assumptions described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Certain Assumptions,\u201d the\nestimated aggregate value of the unvested Zendesk equity awards that will be held by Zendesk\u2019s executive officers\nas of the Closing Date are as follows: (a) Aggregate Option Spread Value of vested in-the-money Stock Options -\n$167,463,269.10\u037e (b) Aggregate Option Spread Value of unvested in-the-money Stock Options - $34,753.68\u037e and (c)\nunvested RSU Awards (with performance for performance-based unvested RSUs deemed achieved at target) -\n$27,267,135.00. Zendesk\u2019s executive officers do not hold any vested RSU Awards. Please see the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Zendesk\u2019s Named Executive Officers in\nConnection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated value of each named executive officer\u2019s unvested Zendesk equity\nawards, all of which are afforded \u201cdouble trigger\u201d treatment.\nBased on the assumptions described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Certain Assumptions,\u201d the\nestimated aggregate value of the unvested RSU Awards held by Zendesk\u2019s nonemployee directors, all of which will\nbecome fully vested upon the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, is\n$1,800,000, and they are afforded \u201csingle-trigger\u201d treatment. Zendesk\u2019s nonemployee directors do not hold any Stock\nOptions.\nChange in Control Acceleration Plan\nEach of our named executive officers is a participant in the Zendesk Change in Control Acceleration Plan (which we\nrefer to as the \u201cCIC Plan\u201d). Under the CIC Plan, in the event that a participant\u2019s employment is terminated on or within\n12 months following the date of a change in control (which the Merger will constitute) either (a) by Zendesk other\nthan for cause (as defined in the CIC Plan), death or disability, or (b) by the participant with good reason (as defined\nin the CIC Plan), the vesting of all outstanding unvested stock options and other stock-based awards (including the\nRetention Grants described below and the cash awards described above) that are subject to time-based vesting and\nthat are then held by the participant will immediately accelerate and become exercisable or nonforfeitable, as\napplicable, as of the date of such a termination. The CIC Plan also provides that payments under the CIC Plan will be\nreduced in order to eliminate exposure to an excise tax that would otherwise be imposed under Section 4999 of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if the participant will retain a greater net after-tax amount if such\nreduction is applied (a \u201cbetter of net after-tax cutback\u201d).\nSeverance Plan\nIn connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, Zendesk is implementing a severance plan (which we refer\nto as the \u201cSeverance Plan\u201d) for all employees of Zendesk, including Zendesk\u2019s executive officers. The Severance Plan\nprovides for different levels of severance benefits depending on the participant\u2019s seniority with Zendesk in\nconnection with a termination of the participant\u2019s employment by Zendesk without cause or by the participant for\ngood reason (each term as defined in the Severance Plan). For Zendesk\u2019s executive officers, those severance benefits\nare: (a) a lump sum severance payment equal to the sum of the participant\u2019s (i) annual rate of base salary and (ii)\nannual target bonus opportunity\u037e (b) 12 months of COBRA premium payments\u037e and (c) either (i) if the termination\noccurs prior to the Effective Time, acceleration of equity awards that would have become vested within six months\nafter termination, or (ii) if the termination occurs during the one year after the Effective Time, acceleration of vesting\nof all then outstanding equity awards pursuant to the CIC Plan, including any cash awards into which the\nparticipant\u2019s Zendesk equity awards were converted in connection with the Merger. Participants must sign a release\nof claims against Zendesk to receive these severance payments. The Severance Plan does not provide for a gross-up\npayment to any of the executive officers, or any other eligible employee, to offset any excise taxes that may be\nimposed under Section 4999 of the Code.\nPlease see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to\nZendesk\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated value of each named executive\nofficer\u2019s severance benefits under the Severance Plan.\nEquity Retention Grants\nOn June 23, 2022, the Board of Directors adopted an equity-based retention program, pursuant to which certain\nexecutives at or above the level of Vice President and above, including Messrs. McDermott and Gennaro,\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand Mses. Glaser and Constantinople, were granted RSU Awards that vest one year from the grant date (or earlier in\naccordance with the terms of the CIC Plan), subject to the recipient\u2019s continued employment with Zendesk and its\nsubsidiaries through such date (which we refer to as the \u201cRetention Grants\u201d). The Retention Grants will be converted\ninto cash awards in connection with the Merger, as provided above.\nPlease see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to\nZendesk\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated value of each named executive\nofficer\u2019s Retention Grant, which is afforded \u201cdouble trigger\u201d treatment.\nTransaction Incentive Pool\nIn connection with the Merger, the Compensation Committee may award up to $30 million in discretionary bonuses to\nZendesk employees for retention purposes, including up to $7.5 million, in the aggregate, in discretionary bonuses\n(which we refer to as the \u201cIncentive Bonuses\u201d) to certain executive officers (other than the CEO), subject to\ncontinued employment of such officers through January 1, 2023 (or, if earlier, on and after the Closing, a severance-\nqualifying event under the Severance Plan) and the Compensation Committee\u2019s evaluation, as of the Closing Date, of\neach such officer\u2019s individual performance during the period between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the\nClosing Date. If the Effective Time has not occurred by March 15, 2023, the amount of the Incentive Bonus will be\ncredited against any annual cash incentive bonus that becomes payable under the 2022 bonus plan (as described\nbelow). The Compensation Committee has not determined the amount of discretionary bonuses, if any, that may\nbecome payable to any of the executive officers pursuant to the transaction incentive pool.\nTreatment of 2022 Annual Bonus\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, if the Effective Time occurs on or before December 31, 2022, Parent will,\nand will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its affiliates to, honor, in accordance with its terms, each of the\nZendesk benefit plans providing for annual cash incentive bonus opportunities for 2022 (or portion thereof). Parent\nwill, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its affiliates to, pay to each Zendesk employee (including\nMessrs. Svane, McDermott and Gennaro, and Mses. Glaser and Constantinople (our \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d for\npurposes of this proxy statement)) who participates in a 2022 bonus plan a bonus otherwise earned in accordance\nwith the terms and conditions of such 2022 bonus plan (including any condition of continued employment)\u037e provided\nthat the aggregate of all such employee bonuses company-wide to be paid under the 2022 bonus plan must be no\nless than 50% of the aggregate target bonus amount for all such employees. The Compensation Committee has not\nyet determined the level of performance achievement under the 2022 bonus plan, and therefore has not yet\ndetermined the amount of annual cash incentive bonuses, if any, that may become payable to any of the executive\nofficers pursuant to the 2022 bonus plan.\nTransition Services Agreement with Alex Constantinople\nOn July 28, 2022, Zendesk and Alex Constantinople entered into a transition services agreement, under which Ms.\nConstantinople will continue to serve in her role as Chief Marketing Officer of Zendesk through September 30, 2022\n(or such earlier date as Zendesk may determine), at which time Ms. Constantinople\u2019s employment with Zendesk will\nend. In consideration of the foregoing, and subject to execution of a release of claims at the end of employment, Ms.\nConstantinople will receive: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to $210,000 (six months of her current base salary),\n(b) immediate vesting of any then-unvested stock options and time-vesting restricted stock unit awards (excluding\nthe award granted to her on June 23, 2022) that are otherwise scheduled to vest on or before March 31, 2023, and (c) a\nprorated portion of her target bonus for the nine-month period of service during the fiscal year equal to $189,000\n(paid at such time as annual bonuses are payable). By entering into this transition services agreement, Ms.\nConstantinople ceases to be eligible to receive any payments or benefits under any other severance or equity\nacceleration plans of Zendesk, including the CIC Plan. In addition, Zendesk has waived the obligation that Ms.\nConstantinople repay the remaining portion of the signing bonus she received when she commenced employment in\n2021.\nPotential Employment Arrangements with Parent\nAny of Zendesk\u2019s executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide\nservices to Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, prior to, on or following the Closing, enter into\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnew compensation arrangements with Parent or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no\nnew individualized compensation arrangements between Zendesk\u2019s executive officers and Parent or the Surviving\nCorporation have been established.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Zendesk\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled, among\nother things, to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six years following the Effective Time\nunder directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation. This indemnification and\ninsurance coverage is further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-\nIndemnification and Insurance.\u201d\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Zendesk\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the\nMerger\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-K, which\nrequires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of Zendesk that is\nbased on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, neither our former chief financial officer\nElena Gomez, nor our former deputy chief financial officer and interim chief financial officer Michael Cabi, is\nreferenced below, because their employment terminated prior to the end of our most recently completed fiscal year, at\nwhich time both such individuals ceased to be eligible for any compensatory payments or benefits described in this\nproxy statement.

            "text": "Appraisal Rights\nIf the Merger is consummated, Zendesk stockholders who continuously hold shares of Zendesk common stock\nthrough the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and properly demand\nappraisal of their shares and otherwise comply with the statutory requirements of Section 262 of the\n72TABLE OF CONTENTS\nDGCL will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is\nqualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and\nincorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not\nconstitute a recommendation that Zendesk stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All\nreferences in Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder,\u201d \u201cholder of shares of Zendesk common stock\u201d or\n\u201cZendesk stockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of Zendesk common stock unless otherwise expressly\nnoted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of Zendesk common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the\nshares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Zendesk common stock\nheld of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker, fiduciary (such as a trustee, guardian or\ncustodian), depository or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps\nsummarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Zendesk\ncommon stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should\nconsult with your bank, broker or other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, Zendesk stockholders who: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal\nof their shares\u037e (b) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (c) continuously are the record\nholders of such shares through the Effective Time\u037e and (d) otherwise exactly follow the procedures set forth in\nSection 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive\npayment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Zendesk common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising\nfrom the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to\nbe fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. However, after an appraisal petition has been\nfiled, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Zendesk stockholders who have\nasserted appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and\nperfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock as measured in accordance with\nsubsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (ii) the value of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of\nZendesk common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million (conditions (i)\nand (ii) which are referred to as the \u201cownership thresholds\u201d). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its\ndiscretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound\nquarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any time before the\nDelaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily\npay to each Zendesk stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in\nwhich case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if\nany, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nin addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The\nSurviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, such as the Special\nMeeting, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was\nsuch on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available that\nappraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes\nZendesk\u2019s notice to its stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text\nof Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with the Merger, any Zendesk\nstockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should\nreview this discussion and Annex D carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a\ntimely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A Zendesk stockholder who\nloses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in the Merger\nAgreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares\nof Zendesk common stock, Zendesk believes that if a Zendesk stockholder considers exercising such rights, that\nZendesk stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nZendesk stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Zendesk common stock\nmust do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe Zendesk stockholder must not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e\n73\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe Zendesk stockholder must deliver to Zendesk a written demand for appraisal before the vote by the\nZendesk stockholders is taken on the Merger Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Zendesk stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Zendesk common stock from the date of\nmaking the demand through the Effective Time (a Zendesk stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the\nZendesk stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Zendesk stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Zendesk common stock\nheld either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must\nfile a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares\nwithin 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any\npetition and has no intention of doing so.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement, a Zendesk stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must\nvote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny Zendesk stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Zendesk, before the vote on the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will\nbe submitted to Zendesk stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such Zendesk stockholder\u2019s shares, and\nthat Zendesk stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A\nZendesk stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for\nappraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is\nsubmitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the Zendesk stockholder\u2019s appraisal rights. Therefore, a\nZendesk stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy\ncontaining instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting, or otherwise\nfail to vote, on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement\nnor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself,\nconstitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal\nmust be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or\nvote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A Zendesk stockholder\u2019s failure to\nmake the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special\nMeeting of Zendesk stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Zendesk common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares\nregistered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Zendesk common stock must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform Zendesk of the identity of the holder\nand state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the Merger.\nIf the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or\ncustodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record\nby more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf\nof all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a\ndemand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners\nand expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nZENDESK STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER\nNOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR\nBANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES\nFOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES.\nA PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER\nPERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR\n74\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN\nA TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be in writing and should be mailed or delivered to:\nZendesk, Inc.\nAttention: Shanti Ariker, Corporate Secretary\nsecretary@zendesk.com\n989 Market Street\nSan Francisco, CA 94103\nAt any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Zendesk stockholder who has delivered a written demand to\nZendesk and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may\nwithdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering to Zendesk a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days\nafter the Effective Time shall require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any Zendesk stockholder without the approval of the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndeems just\u037e provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any Zendesk stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such Zendesk\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the Merger Consideration within 60 days after the Effective Time. If\nan appraisal proceeding is commenced and Zendesk, as the Surviving Corporation, does not approve a request to\nwithdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any Zendesk stockholder\nwho withdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a Zendesk\nstockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal\nproceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the Merger Consideration being offered pursuant\nto the Merger Agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each\nZendesk stockholder who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has\nnot voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective\ndate thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any Zendesk stockholder\nwho has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any\nbeneficial owner of shares of Zendesk common stock held either in a voting trust or by nominee on behalf of such\nperson) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy\nserved on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a Zendesk stockholder (or beneficial owner),\ndemanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting Zendesk stockholders entitled to\nappraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and\nZendesk stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any\nnegotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Zendesk common stock. Accordingly, any Zendesk\nstockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal\nrights in respect of their shares of Zendesk common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section\n262. The failure of a Zendesk stockholder to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could\nnullify the Zendesk stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any Zendesk stockholder who has complied with the requirements of\nSection 262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from\nthe Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Zendesk common stock not\nvoted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Zendesk has received demands\nfor appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail such\nstatement to the requesting Zendesk stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the Surviving\n75\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCorporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery\nof demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of Zendesk common stock held either in a\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking\nappraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph. As noted above,\nhowever, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a Zendesk stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a Zendesk stockholder or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is served\nupon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to\nfile with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all Zendesk\nstockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares\nhave not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of\nthe time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the Zendesk\nstockholders shown on such verified list at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least\none week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,\nDelaware, or in another publication determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs of these notices are\nborne by the Surviving Corporation. After notice to Zendesk stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those Zendesk stockholders who\nhave complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of\nChancery may require Zendesk stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates\n(if any) to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any\nZendesk stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that Zendesk\nstockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all\nZendesk stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of \u201cFair Value\u201d\nAfter determining the Zendesk stockholders entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above has been satisfied as to Zendesk stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will\nbe conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of the shares of Zendesk common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value\n(subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation\npursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 that have the effect of limiting the sum on which interest accrues as\ndescribed below). In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.\nUnless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal\nReserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the\nEffective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery\nenters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each Zendesk stockholder\nentitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on\nan amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary\npayment, unless paid at such time.\nIn Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which\nare generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts\nthat could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwhich rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In\nWeinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,\nmay be considered.\u201d\nZendesk stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they\nwould receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an\ninvestment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is\nnot an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as\nto the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and Zendesk\nstockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower\nthan, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Zendesk nor Parent anticipates offering more than the\nMerger Consideration to any Zendesk stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Zendesk and Parent\nreserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any\nappraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Zendesk common stock is less\nthan the Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above has been satisfied as to Zendesk stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an\nappraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and\nexpenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the\nDelaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a Zendesk stockholder,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a Zendesk\nstockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and\nexpenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all of the shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence\nof such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any Zendesk stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Zendesk common stock under Section\n262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the Zendesk stockholder\u2019s\nshares of Zendesk common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to\nreceive the Merger Consideration, without interest. A Zendesk stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or\nwithdraw, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if\nneither of the ownership thresholds described above is met or if the Zendesk stockholder properly delivers to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of such holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger\nConsideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no Zendesk stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote\nsuch shares of Zendesk common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on\nthe stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of Zendesk common stock, if any, payable to\nZendesk stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the\nownership thresholds described above is met, or if the Zendesk stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a\nwritten withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the\nEffective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such Zendesk\nstockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nhowever, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any Zendesk stockholder without the approval of the\ncourt, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just\u037e provided, however, that the\nforegoing shall not affect the right of any Zendesk stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such Zendesk stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept\nthe terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a Zendesk\nstockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Zendesk stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights\nis encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",

The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants filed or caused to be filed\na materially false and misleading preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to the Merger in violation of\nSection 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiffs seek as\nrelief, among other things, injunctive relief preventing defendants from filing a definitive proxy statement and from\nconsummating the Merger unless additional disclosures are made, rescission of the Merger in the event the Merger is\nconsummated or awarding of rescissory damages, relief directing the defendants to account to plaintiffs for all\ndamages suffered as a result of the alleged violations, and an award of costs and disbursements, including\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees and expenses. On August 7, 2022, one purported Zendesk stockholder sent a\ndraft complaint, and another purported Zendesk stockholder sent a demand letter, each alleging to have identified\nmaterially misleading and incomplete statements in the preliminary proxy statement.\nAdditionally, Zendesk received a demand letter dated August 5, 2022 on behalf of a purported Zendesk stockholder\npursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL requesting to inspect certain of Zendesk\u2019s books and records relating to, among\nother things, the Merger.\nZendesk believes the claims asserted in each of the lawsuits, draft complaint and demand letters are without merit.\nAdditional lawsuits arising out of the Merger may also be filed in the future.",

This\ndiscussion is limited to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders who hold their shares of Zendesk common stock as\n\u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This\ndiscussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published\npositions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on\nthe date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time,\npossibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the\nstatements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or\nthat a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax considerations described in this discussion. No\nadvance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed below.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the\nU.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and\ncircumstances, or to Zendesk stockholders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including,\nfor example:\n\u2022\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\n\u2022\nmutual funds\u037e\n\u2022\ninsurance companies\u037e\n\u2022\nbrokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities\u037e\n\u2022\ndealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of\nZendesk common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nregulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts\u037e\n\u2022\nretirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts\u037e\n\u2022\ntax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations\nand pension funds\u037e\n78TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nholders that hold shares of Zendesk common stock as part of a \u201cstraddle,\u201d hedge, constructive sale, or\nother integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\nPartnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, \u201cS\ncorporations,\u201d or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such\nentities)\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Zendesk common\nstock (by vote or value)\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that received their shares of Zendesk common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax-\nqualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that own an equity interest in Parent following the Merger\u037e and\n\u2022\npersons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to Zendesk\ncommon stock as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.\nThis discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax\n(such as estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or foreign income or non-income tax\nconsiderations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations arising under the unearned income\nMedicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the alternative\nminimum tax or any considerations in respect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the\nTreasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into in connection\ntherewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement).\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a\nbeneficial owner of shares of Zendesk common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such\npartnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and\ncertain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of Zendesk\ncommon stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY\nPARTICULAR ZENDESK STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE ZENDESK STOCKHOLDER\u2019S\nPARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO\nTHE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX\nCONSEQUENCES.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of Zendesk common stock that is\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the\nlaws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless\nof its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration\nof such trust and one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority\nto control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust validly elected to be treated as a United\nStates person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA \u201cnon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Zendesk common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or\narrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes.\n79\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Zendesk common stock pursuant to the Merger will be\na taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an\namount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis\nin the shares of Zendesk common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis\ngenerally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Zendesk common stock. A U.S. Holder\u2019s\ngain or loss on the disposition of shares of Zendesk common stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or\nloss. Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such\nshares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-\ncorporate holders, including individuals, currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Zendesk common\nstock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period\nseparately with respect to each block of Zendesk common stock.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nIn general, subject to the discussion below regarding potential backup withholding, the receipt of cash by a non-U.S.\nHolder in exchange for shares of Zendesk common stock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to United States\nfederal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain, if any, recognized by the non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with a trade or business of the\nnon-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to\nthe non-U.S. Holder\u2019s permanent establishment in the United States)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable\nyear of the exchange of shares of Zendesk common stock pursuant to the Merger and certain other\nconditions are met\u037e or\n\u2022\nshares of Zendesk common stock constitute a United States real property interest by reason of Zendesk\u2019s\nstatus as a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the\nCode (which we refer to as \u201cUSRPHC\u201d) at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the\ndate of the Effective Time or the period that the non-U.S. Holder held the applicable shares of Zendesk\ncommon stock (which we refer to as the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d).\nGain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to United States federal income tax on a net\nincome basis in substantially the same manner as if the non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder (unless an applicable\nincome tax treaty provides otherwise), and if the non-U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, it may also be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be\nprovided by an applicable income tax treaty) on its \u201ceffectively connected earnings and profits\u201d for the taxable year,\nas adjusted for certain items.\nA non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of\n30% (or such lower rate as may be provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on any gain recognized, which may\nbe offset by U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year (if any).\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, Zendesk believes it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC\nduring the five-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time. Even if Zendesk is or was a USRPHC during the\nrelevant period, gain arising from a non-U.S. Holder\u2019s receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Zendesk common\nstock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if the Zendesk common stock is \u201cregularly\ntraded,\u201d as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such non-U.S. Holder\nowned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of the Zendesk common stock throughout the Relevant Period.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders and non-\nU.S. Holders in connection with the Merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder\npursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a\n80\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nproperly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification number\nand certifying that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and\notherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.\nA non-U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax (currently, at a rate of 24%)\nunless the non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS\nForm W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8), attesting to such non-U.S. Holder\u2019s status\nas a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder\nor a non-U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder\u2019s or non-U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder or non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX\nCONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY\nSTATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS\nREGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF\nTHEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.",

Additionally, we may seek to\nadjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special\nMeeting.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal (a) when a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the\nshares of Zendesk common stock properly cast for the Adjournment Proposal, and (b) when a quorum is not present,\nrequires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock representing a majority of the voting\npower present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting.\nAssuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect\non the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal, (b) abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment\nProposal and (c) broker \u201cnon-votes\u201d (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. If a\nquorum is not present, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nShares of Zendesk common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be\nvoted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a Zendesk stockholder returns a signed proxy card\nwithout indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of Zendesk common stock represented by that\nproxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and\nall of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\n108TABLE OF CONTENTS\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT",

The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the\nMerger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value\n$0.01 per share, of the Company that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the\nMerger (such shares, collectively, \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d or \u201cShares\u201d and each, a \u201cShare\u201d), other than (i) each\nShare that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or its Subsidiaries (as such term is defined in the Merger\nAgreement), including Merger Sub, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger or held by the Company or\nits wholly owned subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (in each case, other than any such\nShares held in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of third parties), (ii) Dissenting Shares (as such\nterm is defined in the Merger Agreement) and (iii) Shares underlying or comprising unexercised, unvested or\nunsettled Company Equity Awards (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) shall be converted\nautomatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $77.50 in cash, without interest (the \u201cMerger\nConsideration\u201d), subject to any required Tax (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) withholding as\nprovided in the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger\nAgreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in\naccordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other\nthan Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated June 23, 2022\n(the \u201cDraft Merger Agreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and\nother business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information\nrelating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial projections and operating\ndata of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d). Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and\nfinancial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. We also reviewed\nthe historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance\nof the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock with that of certain other selected\npublicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly\navailable, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information\nand considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed\nwith, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the\nCompany, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of Directors of the Company,\nthat they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of\nthe management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered\nthereby. We express no view as to the Company Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. We have\nassumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the final executed Merger\nAgreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in\nOne Maritime Plaza | 24th Floor | San Francisco, CA 94111\nTel: 415.844.7700 | www.qatalyst.com | Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u202f\naccordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition,\nwe have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no\ndelays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or\nthe contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent\nevaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have\nwe been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we have relied, without independent\nverification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and\nproducts of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our\nservices, a portion of which will become payable upon delivery of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger\nfee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us\nfor certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material\nrelationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company or Parent pursuant to which\ncompensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except that Qatalyst Partners has provided financial\nadvisory services to Permira and received a fee of $15 million in connection with such services. Qatalyst Partners\nand/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or\nParent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,\ndomestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these\nactivities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise\neffect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.\nThis opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion\nis for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without\nour prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how to vote with respect to the\nMerger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company Common Stock will trade\nat any time.\nOur opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion\nand the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this\nopinion.
