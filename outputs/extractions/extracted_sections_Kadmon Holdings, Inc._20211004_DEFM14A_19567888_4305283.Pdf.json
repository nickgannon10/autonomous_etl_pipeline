In the event it is not possible or advisable to hold the Special\nMeeting in person, we will announce by issuance of a press release alternative arrangements for the meeting as\npromptly as practicable, which may include holding the Special Meeting solely by means of remote communication.\nIn person attendance at the Special Meeting will be subject to applicable health and safety restrictions relating to\nCOVID-19, and as a result, stockholders are encouraged to vote by submitting a proxy by telephone, over the\nInternet, by returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope.\nAt the Special Meeting, holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock will be asked to:\n1.\nconsider and vote upon the proposal (the \u201cMerger Proposal\u201d) to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve\nthe Merger, as more fully described in this proxy statement and under \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger\nAgreement\u201d beginning on page 74\u037e and\n2.\nconsider and vote upon the proposal (the \u201cAdjournment Proposal\u201d) to adjourn the Special Meeting, if\nnecessary and for a minimum period of time reasonable under the circumstances, to ensure that any\nnecessary supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is provided to Company stockholders a\nreasonable amount of time in advance of the Special Meeting, or to solicit additional proxies if there are\ninsufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Proposal, as more fully\ndescribed in this proxy statement and under \u201cProposal 2: Adjournment of the Special Meeting\u201d beginning\non page 75.\n1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nRecord Date and Quorum\nYou are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting if you owned shares of Common Stock\nand/or Preferred Stock at the close of business on September 27, 2021, which the Company has set as the record date\nfor the Special Meeting (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d). You will have one vote for each share of Common Stock that you owned\non the Record Date and approximately 134 votes for each share of Preferred Stock that you owned as of the Record\nDate. As of the Record Date, there were 176,242,263 shares of Common Stock and 28,708 shares of Preferred Stock\n(which, on an as-converted basis, represents voting rights equivalent to approximately 3,851,031 shares of Common\nStock) outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or\nrepresented by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued\nand outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date will constitute a quorum, permitting the conduct of business\nat the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (as described below) are counted as present for the\npurpose of determining whether a quorum is present.\nVote Required\nApproval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares\nof Common Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock) entitled\nto vote thereon. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the\nMerger Proposal.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock) present in\nperson or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is\npresent. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against approval of this proposal. Broker non-votes are not\ncounted for purposes of this proposal.\nLitigation Related to the Merger\nOn October 1 and 4, 2021, two alleged stockholders of the Company filed actions in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York against the Company and the members of its Board of Directors under the following\ncaptions: (i) Nancy Jaser v. Kadmon Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-08154 (S.D.N.Y.) (the \u201cJaser Action\u201d)\u037e (ii) John\nDillon v. Kadmon Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-08169 (S.D.N.Y.) (the \u201cDillon Action,\u201d and collectively, the\n\u201cActions\u201d). The Actions assert claims solely on behalf of the individual stockholders and generally allege that the\nCompany and its Board of Directors failed to disclose allegedly material information in the proxy statement. The\nActions seek an order enjoining the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and\nawarding damages. We believe that the claims asserted in the Actions are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising\nout of the Merger Agreement may be filed in the future. If additional similar lawsuits are filed, absent new or different\nallegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily announce such additional filings.\nProxies and Revocation\nAny stockholder of record entitled to vote at the Special Meeting may submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet,\nby returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or may vote in person by\nappearing at the Special Meeting.

If you fail to\nsubmit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, or do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other\nnominee with instructions, as applicable, your shares of Common Stock will not be voted on the Merger Proposal,\nwhich will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the Merger Proposal, and your shares of Common Stock\nwill not have an effect on the Adjournment Proposal.\nYou have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before\nit is exercised, by voting again at a later date through any of the methods available to you, by giving written notice of\nrevocation to our Secretary or by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person.\n2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Merger\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge\nwith and into the Company.

injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened\nbreaches) of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement.\nMarket Price of Common Stock\nThe closing price of Common Stock on NASDAQ on September 7, 2021, the last trading day prior to the public\nannouncement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, was $5.30 per share of Common Stock. On October 1, 2021,\nthe most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our stockholders, the closing price for\nCommon Stock on NASDAQ was $8.87 per share of Common Stock.

This means that you are entitled to have the fair value of your shares of Common\nStock and/or Preferred Stock determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment based on that\nvaluation in lieu of the Merger Consideration if you follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL. The\nultimate amount you receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount you\nwould have received under the Merger Agreement.\nTo exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is\ntaken on the Merger Agreement and you must not vote, either in person or by proxy, in favor of the Merger Proposal.\nYour failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights.\nSee \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 79 and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute reproduced in its\nentirety as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through a bank, brokerage\nfirm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or\nother nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by your bank,\nbrokerage firm or other nominee. In view of the complexity of the DGCL, stockholders who wish to pursue appraisal\nrights should consult their legal and financial advisors promptly.\nDelisting and Deregistration of Common Stock\nIf the Merger is completed, the Common Stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange\nAct, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.\n9\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER",

If the\nMerger Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger\nAgreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company\nbecoming a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Sanofi. As a result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be\na public company and you will cease to hold Common Stock or Preferred Stock or have any interest in the\nCompany\u2019s future earnings or growth. In addition, following the Merger, the Common Stock will be delisted from\nNASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.\nQ.\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is completed?\nA.\nUpon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration,\nwithout interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Common Stock that you own\nand/or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, less any applicable tax withholding, for each\nshare of Preferred Stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal\nrights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100 shares of Common Stock, you\nwill receive $950 in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes, in exchange for your shares.

Assuming timely receipt of required\nregulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions, including approval by our stockholders of the\nMerger Proposal, we expect the Merger to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, we cannot\nassure completion by any particular date, if at all.\nQ.\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA.\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the stockholders of the Company or if the Merger is not completed\nfor any other reason, you will continue to hold your shares of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock and you\nwill not receive any payment for such shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain an\nindependent public company, and the Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ. Under\nspecified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay to Sanofi a fee with respect to the termination of\nthe Merger Agreement as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fees and Expenses.\u201d\nQ.\nWhat conditions must be satisfied to complete the Merger?\nA.\nThe respective obligations of the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to\nthe satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by\nour stockholders, receipt of certain regulatory approvals, the absence of any legal prohibitions, the accuracy of\nthe representations and warranties of the parties, compliance by the parties with their respective obligations\nunder the Merger Agreement and the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).\nFor a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the\nMerger, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to Completion of the Merger\u201d and \u201cThe Merger-Regulatory\nApprovals\u201d.\nQ.\nIs the Merger expected to be taxable to me?\nA.\nThe exchange of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable\ntransaction to U.S. holders (as defined in \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the\nMerger\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder and you exchange your shares of\nCommon Stock or Preferred Stock in the Merger for cash, you will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares, including any applicable\nwithholding taxes, and your adjusted tax basis in such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock. Backup\nwithholding may also apply to the cash received by a non-corporate U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger unless\nsuch U.S. holder provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies that such number is correct and that is not\nsubject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. You\nshould read \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d for a more detailed\ndiscussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You should also consult your tax advisor\nfor a complete analysis of the effect of the Merger on your federal, state and local and/or foreign taxes.\nQ:\nWhat will holders of Company equity-based awards receive in the Merger?\nA:\nAs a result of, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Merger:\n\u2022\nWithout any action on the part of any holder of Company Options (i) all unvested Company Options which\nare outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will fully vest and become exercisable Company\nOptions, and (ii) to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option will be\ncanceled at the Effective Time, with the former holder of such canceled Company Option becoming entitled\nto receive an amount in cash equal to the Company Option Merger Consideration.

As a result, if you fail to submit a proxy or vote in person at the Special Meeting,\nor abstain, or you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with instructions, as applicable,\nthis will have the same effect as a vote against the Merger Proposal.\nAs of close of business on the Record Date, there were 176,242,263 outstanding shares of Common Stock and\n28,708 outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (which, on an as-converted basis, represents voting rights\nequivalent to approximately 3,851,031 shares of common stock as of the Record Date).\nQ.\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal?\nA.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock)\npresent in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting, whether or\nnot a quorum is present.\nAbstaining will have the same effect as a vote against the Adjournment Proposal.

This householding process reduces the volume of duplicate information\nand reduces printing and mailing expenses. We have not instituted householding for stockholders of record\u037e\nhowever, certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of Common Stock held\nthrough brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding Common Stock, you may have already\nreceived householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any\nquestions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate\ncopy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke\nyour decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.\nQ.\nWho can help answer any other questions I might have?\nA.\nIf you have additional questions about the Merger, need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your\nshares, or need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact DF King, our\nproxy solicitor, by calling toll-free at (800) 249-7120 or via email at KDMN@dfking.com.\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",

We believe that\nthe claims asserted in the Actions are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising out of the Merger Agreement may be\nfiled in the future. If additional similar lawsuits are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the\nCompany will not necessarily announce such additional filings.\nProxies and Revocation",

The Company will be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, will become a wholly\nowned indirect subsidiary of Sanofi and will continue to exist following the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the\nCompany will cease to be a publicly traded company, the Common Stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and\nderegistered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the\nMerger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of Sanofi or the Surviving Corporation.\nThe Effective Time will occur upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware as provided under the DGCL (or at such later time as we and Sanofi may agree and specify in the certificate\nof merger).\nIn the Merger, each outstanding share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other\nthan Excluded Shares) will be canceled and cease to exist and converted into the right to receive the Common Stock\nMerger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThe following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board of Directors,\nmembers of Company management or the representatives of the Company and other parties.\nThe Board of Directors, with the Company\u2019s senior management, regularly reviews the Company\u2019s business,\noperations, financial performance and strategic direction for the purpose of increasing stockholder value. As part of\nthis on-going review, the Board of Directors considers the Company\u2019s long-term strategies and plans, changes in the\nindustry and markets in which the Company operates, execution opportunities and risks, potential strategic\ntransaction opportunities, including partnership and collaboration opportunities and financial alternatives in light of\ndevelopments of the Company\u2019s clinical and commercial stage products. As part of this process, Company\nmanagement regularly engages in business development and strategic discussions with various participants in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry.\nOn February 16, 2021, the Company issued 3.625% convertible senior notes due 2027 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) in the\naggregate principal amount of $240 million, the proceeds of which the Company anticipated would enable it to\nadvance its planned commercial launch efforts for belumosudil and advance certain of its other pipeline product\ncandidates, including KD033, part of the Company\u2019s immuno-oncology platform.\nOn June 26, 2021, Matthieu Merlin, Head of Business Development and Licensing (General Medicines Business Unit)\nof Sanofi, reached out to a representative of the Company to set up an introductory meeting to explore potential\nopportunities for collaboration between the two companies. At the time of Sanofi\u2019s outreach, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) was reviewing the New Drug Application for belumosudil, the Company\u2019s lead product\ncandidate, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of August 30, 2021. Other of the Company\u2019s\nproduct candidates remain in different stages of clinical and preclinical development.\nThe Company has from time to time utilized the services of Moelis and Cantor Fitzgerald for investment banking and\nother financial services unrelated to the Merger, including Cantor Fitzgerald acting as sole bookrunner\n23TABLE OF CONTENTS\nin connection with the Company\u2019s issuance of the Convertible Notes in February 2021, acting as the placement agent\nfor the Company\u2019s ongoing at-the-market offering program, executing two block trades on behalf of the Company in\nOctober 2019 and May 2020 and acting as the joint bookrunner for the Company\u2019s public offering of Common Stock\nin November 2019.\nOn June 16, 2021, a representative from a potential strategic bidder for the Company (\u201cParty A\u201d) sent an email to\nrepresentatives of Moelis, requesting an introduction to the Company. On June 29, 2021, a representative of Moelis\nintroduced the representative of Party A to Steven Meehan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of\nthe Company.\nOn July 8, 2021, representatives of Party A held a conference call with representatives of the Company, including\nHarlan W. Waksal, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Mr. Meehan, during which the\nparties discussed a general corporate overview of each company and potential synergies that may arise from a\ncollaboration or other strategic transaction.\nOn July 12, 2021, Mr. Merlin held a video conference with Gregory S. Moss, Executive Vice President, General\nCounsel and Corporate Secretary, Chief Compliance Officer of the Company, during which Mr. Merlin and Mr. Moss\neach introduced their company to the other, and Mr. Merlin discussed Sanofi\u2019s interest in belumosudil. Mr. Moss\ndiscussed the Company\u2019s overall development plan with respect to belumosudil, including its focus on the United\nStates and pursuing various global approvals via the FDA\u2019s Project Orbis framework. Mr. Moss also discussed the\nCompany\u2019s innovative pipeline and various corporate aspects of its business.\nOn July 16, 2021, the FDA approved belumosudil for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older\nwith chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. The FDA reviewed\nthe New Drug Application six weeks ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of August 30, 2021. As a\nresult of the announcement, the per share price of the Company\u2019s common stock closed at $4.28 on July 16, 2021, up\nfrom $3.55 from the prior trading day\u2019s closing price.\nOn July 20, 2021, Mr. Merlin held a videoconference with Mr. Moss and other representatives of the Company, during\nwhich Mr. Merlin affirmed Sanofi\u2019s interest in belumosudil but also indicated that Sanofi may be interested in\nexploring a larger transaction taking into account the Company\u2019s product candidates still in development in addition\nto the commercialization of belumosudil. Mr. Merlin also noted that Sanofi was interested in learning more about the\nCompany\u2019s immuno-oncology platform and other pipeline assets and programs. On July 20, 2021, the Company\nentered into a confidentiality agreement with Sanofi which did not contain standstill provisions.\nMr. Merlin and Mr. Moss held a videoconference on July 21, 2021, where Mr. Merlin asked about the Company\u2019s\nwork-to-date around potentially separating out the Company\u2019s immuno-oncology platform. Mr. Moss responded that\na detailed analysis had not been conducted but informal options had been contemplated and considered. Mr. Merlin\nindicated that Sanofi\u2019s interest was firm and expeditious, and Mr. Merlin and Mr. Moss agreed that an in-person\nmanagement presentation was an appropriate next step, as well as contemporaneous subject matter expert\ndiscussion.\nOn July 26, 2021, Kadmon and Party A entered into a confidentiality agreement with standstill provisions (which\npermitted private waivers of the standstill provision and contained a customary \u201cfallaway\u201d provision in the event the\nCompany announced a change of control transaction).\nOn July 27, 2021, representatives of the Company, including Dr. Waksal, Mr. Moss, and Dr. Jeegar Patel, Senior Vice\nPresident, Research and Non-Clinical Development, held a meeting with representatives from Sanofi (including Mr.\nJean-Baptiste de Chatillon, Chief Financial Officer of Sanofi, Mr. Olivier Charmeil, Executive Vice President - General\nMedicines of Sanofi, Mr. Loic Gonnet, Global Head of Mergers & Acquisitions of Sanofi, and Mr. Merlin), with Mr.\nMeehan and other representatives of Sanofi participating by videoconference. During this meeting the parties\ndiscussed information regarding belumosudil, the Company\u2019s immuno-oncology platform and other information\nregarding the Company and its additional pipeline candidates. At a dinner following the meeting, Mr. de Chatillon,\nMr. Charmeil and Mr. Gonnet confirmed that Sanofi was interested in acquiring the Company.\nOn July 28, 2021, representatives of the Company, including Dr. Waksal, Mr. Moss and Dr. Patel met with\nrepresentatives of Party A in their European headquarters with Mr. Meehan and certain representatives of Party A\nparticipating by videoconference. During this meeting the parties discussed belumosudil, the Company\u2019s product\npipeline and other information. Also, during this meeting, Party A indicated that it was interested in acquiring the\nCompany.\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA potential strategic bidder for the Company (\u201cParty B\u201d) had previously indicated an interest in exploring potential\nbusiness development opportunities with the Company following approval of belumosudil. Accordingly, as the\nCompany began to have discussions with Sanofi and Party A, the Company and representatives of the Company\nFinancial Advisors discussed reaching out to Party B. On July 29, 2021, Mr. Meehan had a telephone call with a\nrepresentative of Party B to let them know the Company may be considering a potential collaboration or other\nstrategic transactions and to gauge their interest in exploring such a potential transaction.\nOn July 30, 2021, Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss held an informal discussion with Mr. Tasos Konidaris,\nChairman of the Board of Directors, and directors Mr. Arthur Kirsch and Ms. Nancy Miller-Rich, during which\nmanagement provided an update of the discussions with Sanofi, Party A and Party B.\nOn July 30, 2021, the Company received an e-mail from a representative of Party B introducing representatives of the\nCompany, including Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss, to other representatives of Party B for purposes of discussing a\npotential transaction.\nOn August 1, 2021, the Company and Sanofi amended their confidentiality agreement to provide for standstill\nprovisions (which permitted private waivers of the standstill provisions and contained a customary \u201cfallaway\u201d\nprovision in the event the Company announced a change of control transaction).\nOn August 3, 2021, the Board of Directors held a regular meeting attended by Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss, representatives\nof each of the Company Financial Advisors and a representative of DLA Piper LLP (US) (\u201cDLA Piper\u201d), outside\ncounsel to the Company. Management discussed with the Board of Directors the interest in the Company by Sanofi,\nParty A and Party B and the related discussions to date. The representative of DLA Piper then reviewed with the\nBoard of Directors their fiduciary duties and related considerations. After discussion and deliberation, including with\nrespect to potential benefits to the Company\u2019s stockholders of a potential sale of the Company and the risk and\nuncertainties if the Company were to remain an independent public company, the Board of Directors determined it to\nbe in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to take further steps to confidentially explore the\npotential interest of third parties to acquire the Company, including the interest of Sanofi, Party A and Party B. The\nBoard of Directors also designated Mr. Konidaris, Mr. Kirsch and Ms. Miller-Rich, each of whom is an independent,\ndisinterested director, and Dr. Waksal, as members of a transaction committee of the Board of Directors (the\n\u201cTransaction Committee\u201d) and instructed the Transaction Committee to engage Cantor Fitzgerald and Moelis, and to\noversee the activities of management and Cantor Fitzgerald and Moelis in connection with exploring a potential sale\nof the Company and to provide follow-up communication to the Board of Directors, as appropriate. However, the\nBoard of Directors determined that final authority with respect to any transaction would reside with the full Board of\nDirectors. The Transaction Committee was set up for efficiency purposes, and not due to any perceived conflict of\ninterest with respect to any member of the Board of Directors.\nOn August 4, 2021, each of Sanofi and Party A were notified that the Board of Directors had engaged the Company\nFinancial Advisors and authorized the exploration of a potential sale of the Company. In addition, Party A was\nprovided access to a virtual data room. Also on August 4, 2021, the Company received a non-binding indication of\ninterest from Sanofi to acquire all of the Common Stock for $7.00 per share, a 55% premium to the closing price per\nshare on August 3, 2021, and with a request to enter into an exclusivity agreement. After receipt of the non-binding\nindication of interest, the Transaction Committee held a virtual meeting attended by Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss, Kyle\nCarver, the Company\u2019s Chief Accounting Officer, representatives of the Company Financial Advisors and\nrepresentatives of DLA Piper to review the Sanofi non-binding indication of interest and, after discussion, determined\nthat it undervalued the Company. After discussion, the Transaction Committee directed management of the Company\nto inform Sanofi that the proposal undervalued the Company and the Company was not interested in a transaction at\nthat level. Following the meeting, management delivered the Board of Director\u2019s message to Sanofi.\nBetween August 4, 2021 and August 23, 2021, Party A conducted due diligence.\nOn August 5, 6 and 7, 2021, the Company Financial Advisors held calls with representatives of Centerview Partners,\nfinancial advisor to Sanofi (\u201cCenterview\u201d) to discuss the Company\u2019s rationale for rejecting Sanofi\u2019s August 4, 2021\nproposal.\nOn August 5, 2021, the Company and Party B entered into a confidentiality agreement that contained standstill\nprovisions (which permitted private waivers of the standstill provision, private offers to the Board of Directors and\ncontained a customary \u201cfallaway\u201d provision in the event the Company announced a change of control transaction).\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 6, 2021, Party B was provided access to the virtual data room. Also on August 6, 2021, representatives of\nthe Company, including Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss and Mr. Patel held a telephone conference with Party A,\nin which the parties discussed research and development related to the Company\u2019s products other than belumosudil.\nOn August 9, 2021, the Company received a revised non-binding indication of interest from Sanofi to acquire all of\nthe Common Stock for $9.00 per share, an 81% premium to the closing price per share on August 6, 2021, and with a\nrequest to enter into an exclusivity agreement.\nOn August 10, the Transaction Committee, together with Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss, met to discuss interactions to\ndate with Sanofi, Party A and Party B and to review Sanofi\u2019s August 9, 2021 revised non-binding indication of\ninterest. The Transaction Committee instructed the management team to explore potential transaction opportunities\nwith parties other than Sanofi, Party A and Party B. The Transaction Committee also instructed the Company\u2019s\nmanagement team to convey to Sanofi that the Company would not agree to exclusivity at an offer price of $9.00 per\nshare, but that it would allow Sanofi to begin conducting its due diligence.

For some of the factors considered, see \u201cThe Merger-Reasons for Recommendation.\u201d\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be\naware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition\nto, yours. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the\nMerger and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company. See under\nthe heading \u201cThe Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the Merger Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d approval of\nthe Adjournment Proposal.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nthe Board of Directors consulted with the Company\u2019s senior management, as well as representatives of its financial\nadvisors and outside legal counsel. In the course of making its determination (1) that the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of,\nthe Company and its stockholders and (2) to recommend that the Board of Directors approve and declare advisable\nthe Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, the Board\nof Directors considered numerous factors, including the following non-exhaustive list of material factors and benefits\nof the Merger, each of which the Board of Directors believed supported its determination and recommendation:\nCommon Stock Merger Consideration. The Board of Directors considered:\n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of the Common Stock, including the performance of the Common\nStock relative to other participants in the Company\u2019s industry\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Common Stock Merger Consideration represented a premium value for the Company\u2019s\nstockholders, including a premium of 79% over the closing price on September 7, 2021 and a premium of\napproximately 113% over the volume weighted average price for the 60 trading days prior to such date\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe trading history of the Company and the offer price relative to such history.\nBusiness and Financial Condition. The Board of Directors considered the Company\u2019s historical and projected\nbusiness, industry, markets, financial performance and condition and its prospects.\n29TABLE OF CONTENTS\nRisks and Uncertainties. The Board of Directors considered, among other factors, that the Company\u2019s business and\nthat its stockholders would continue to be subject to significant risks and uncertainties if the Company remained an\nindependent public company, including:\n\u2022\nthat the achievement of the Company\u2019s standalone plan has been and would continue to be subject to\nnumerous risks and uncertainties, including those related to the regulatory approval and market acceptance\nof the Company\u2019s product pipeline and the cost and complexity associated with globally commercializing\nREZUROCKTM (belumosudil)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe pace and magnitude of on-going changes in the markets in which the Company operates and competes\u037e\n\u2022\nthat changes to U.S. legislative, FDA or global regulations may make it more difficult for us to obtain\nregulatory approval of the Company\u2019s products and/or manufacture its products\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the Company\u2019s revenue depends in part upon a limited number of direct customers and strategic\npartners\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the Company faces both business disruption risks and opportunities related to the COVID-19\npandemic and that developments with respect to the pandemic, including the pace of vaccinations, the\nonset of additional outbreaks and changing regulatory priorities are difficult to predict and could have an\nadverse effect on its business\u037e\n\u2022\nthat if the Company\u2019s products contribute to a death or a serious injury, it can result in voluntary corrective\nactions or agency enforcement actions\u037e\n\u2022\nthat developing, introducing and growing the Company\u2019s new products and services requires long-term\nand strategic investments, and the significant risks that these products and services will not be successful\nor realize favorable returns\u037e\n\u2022\nthe difficulties for the Company to accurately forecast demand for its products and overall Company\nperformance in light of these and other risks and uncertainties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of whether future trading values would reach the Common Stock Merger Consideration as\ncompared to the certainty of realizing a compelling value for shares of Common Stock in the Merger\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe risks set forth in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2020 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\nThe Sale Process. The Board of Directors considered:\n\u2022\nthat after receiving the initial indication of interest from Sanofi, the Board of Directors commenced a sale\nprocess and considered each of the strategic acquirers it believed most likely and capable of acquiring the\nCompany\u037e\n\u2022\nthat representatives of the Company, including through the Company Financial Advisors, had contact with\nnine potential strategic acquirers regarding their potential interest in acquiring the Company and that three\nof the nine expressed an interest in such discussions, entered into confidentiality agreements with the\nCompany and were granted further access to the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nthat of the three potential strategic acquirers that engaged in discussion regarding a potential acquisition\nof the Company, only one, Sanofi, made a final offer to acquire the Company and that the Company would\nrisk losing the opportunity with Sanofi in the event the Company sought to continue discussions with\nsuch third parties or pursue discussions with additional third parties prior to entry into the Merger\nAgreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthat Sanofi increased the price per share of Common Stock it was willing to pay from $7.00 to $9.50 in the\ncourse of their negotiations with the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nthe adequacy and results of the Company\u2019s process of exploring strategic alternatives and the Board of\nDirectors\u2019 belief that the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share represents the highest\nprice reasonably obtainable\u037e and\n\u2022\nthat the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share was the only final offer received at the\nconclusion of the Company\u2019s process of exploring strategic alternatives.\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNegotiation Process. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement were the\nresult of robust arm\u2019s-length negotiations conducted by the Company, with the knowledge and at the direction of the\nBoard of Directors, and with the assistance of independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel.\nCantor Fitzgerald\u2019s Financial Analysis. The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis of the Common\nStock Merger Consideration that Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed with the Board of Directors on September 6, 2021,\nincluding Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion rendered to the Board of Directors on September 7, 2021, to the effect that, as of\nsuch date and based upon and subject to various assumptions, matters considered and limitations, conditions and\nqualifications described in its opinion, the Common Stock Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by\nholders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates) was fair from a financial\npoint of view to such holders. For a description of Cantor Fitzgerald's opinion, please see below under \u201c-Opinions of\nthe Company Financial Advisors-Opinion of Cantor Fitzgerald.\u201d The written opinion delivered by Cantor Fitzgerald is\nattached hereto as Annex C.\nMoelis\u2019s Financial Analysis. The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis of the Common Stock Merger\nConsideration that Moelis reviewed with the Board of Directors on September 6, 2021, including Moelis\u2019 opinion\nrendered to the Board of Directors on September 7, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and\nsubject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations\nset forth therein, the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share to be received in the Merger by holders\nof Common Stock, other than Sanofi and its affiliates and holders of Excluded Shares, pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a description of the Moelis\u2019 opinion, please\nsee below under \u201c-Opinions of the Company Financial Advisors-Opinion of Moelis & Company LLC\u201d. The written\nopinion delivered by Moelis is attached hereto as Annex D.\nCertainty of Consideration. The Board of Directors considered that the all-cash nature of the consideration to be\npaid in the Merger allows Company stockholders to realize immediate and certain premium cash value and liquidity,\nwhile avoiding the significant future risks and uncertainties for the Company and the markets generally.\nCompany Projections. The Board of Directors considered Company Projections, which reflect an application of\nvarious assumptions of the Company\u2019s senior management. The Board of Directors considered the inherent\nuncertainty of attaining management\u2019s forecasts, including those set forth in \u201c-Company Projections,\u201d and that due\nto such uncertainty the Company\u2019s actual financial results in future periods could differ materially from management\u2019s\nforecasted results.\nLikelihood of Completion\u037e Certainty of Payment. The Board of Directors considered its belief that, absent a superior\nproposal, the Merger represented a transaction that would likely be consummated based on, among other factors:\n\u2022\nthe absence of any financing condition to the consummation of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Agreement requires Sanofi to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain applicable\nregulatory approvals to consummate the Merger as further described below under the heading \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Regulatory Approvals\u037e\u201d\n\u2022\nthe exceptions contained within the \u201cCompany Material Adverse Effect\u201d definition, which generally defines\nthe standard for closing risk\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the conditions to the closing of the Merger are specific and limited in scope\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to request that the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of\nChancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the County of New Castle,\nDelaware) specifically enforce the Merger Agreement, including the consummation of the Merger, under\ncertain circumstances described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Specific Performance.\u201d\nOther Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors considered other terms of the Merger Agreement,\nwhich are more fully described below under the heading \u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d Certain provisions of the Merger\nAgreement that the Board of Directors considered significant include:\n\u2022\nAbility to Respond to Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals. Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement\nby the Company\u2019s stockholders, the Company may provide confidential information and/or engage in\ndiscussions or negotiations in connection with a bona fide unsolicited written acquisition proposal (as\nmore\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfully described below under the headings \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Change in Recommendation or\nAlternative Acquisition Agreement\u201d) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation\nwith its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal either constitutes a\nsuperior proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal and that the failure to take such\naction would be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to certain\nnotice requirements in favor of Sanofi and the entry into an acceptable confidentiality agreement with the\nunsolicited bidder\u037e\n\u2022\nChange in Recommendation in Response to a Superior Proposal. The ability of the Company to terminate\nthe Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, subject to Sanofi\u2019s ability to match such\nsuperior proposal and subject to paying Sanofi a termination fee of approximately $60.125 million and the\nother conditions of the Merger Agreement (as more fully described below under the heading \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Termination Fee\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nCompany Termination Fee. The fact that the termination fee described above is approximately 3.25% of the\npurchase price of the Company, which amount the Board of Directors believed was reasonable in light of,\namong other things, the typical size of such termination fees in similar transactions, the benefits of the\nMerger to the Company\u2019s stockholders, the likelihood that a fee of such size would not be preclusive of\nother offers and that the Company had concluded a process to explore strategic alternatives prior to\nentering into the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nTermination Date. The fact that the Termination Date under the Merger Agreement on which either party,\nsubject to certain exceptions, can terminate the Merger Agreement allows for sufficient time to consummate\nthe Merger, while minimizing the length of time during which the Company would be required to operate\nsubject to the restrictions on interim operations set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The availability of statutory appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the\nMerger.\nThe Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors in its\ndeliberations concerning the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including\nthe following:\n\u2022\nNo Participation in the Company\u2019s Future. The Board of Directors considered that if the Merger is\nconsummated, Company stockholders will receive the Merger Consideration in cash and will no longer\nhave the opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the Company or benefit from any\npotential future appreciation in the value of Company shares, including any value that could be achieved if\nthe Company engages in future strategic or other transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nNon-Solicitation Covenant. The Board of Directors considered that the Merger Agreement imposes\nrestrictions on the Company\u2019s solicitation of acquisition proposals from third parties. However, based upon\nthe process to review strategic alternatives described above in \u201c-Background of the Merger,\u201d and the fact\nthat the most likely potential acquirers of the Company were contacted during such process, the Board of\nDirectors believed it had a strong basis for determining that the Merger was the best transaction\nreasonably likely to be available to the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nTermination Fee. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Company must pay Sanofi a\ntermination fee of approximately $60.125 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain\ncircumstances, including to accept a superior proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nInterim Operating Covenants. The Board of Directors considered that the Merger Agreement imposes\nrestrictions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, requiring\nthe Company and its subsidiaries to (A) ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries conduct its and their\nrespective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects\u037e (B) use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its and their respective current business organizations,\nkeep available the services of its and their respective current officers and employees and maintain its and\ntheir respective relations and goodwill with material customers, suppliers, landlords, governmental\nauthorities and other persons having material business relationships with the Company or its subsidiaries\u037e\nand (C) keep in full force and effect all appropriate insurance policies covering all material assets of the\nCompany\u037e\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nRisks the Merger May Not Be Completed. The Board of Directors considered the risk that the conditions to\nthe Merger may not be satisfied and that, therefore, the Merger would not be consummated. The Board of\nDirectors also considered the risks and costs to the Company if the Merger is not consummated, including\nthe diversion of management and employee attention, potential employee attrition, the potential effect on\nthe Company\u2019s business operations, including its relationships with vendors, distributors, customers,\npartners and others that do business with the Company, and the potential effect on the trading price of\nCompany shares\u037e\n\u2022\nPotential Conflicts of Interest. The Board of Directors considered that the Company\u2019s executive officers\nand directors have financial interests in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including\nthe Merger, that may be different from or in addition to those of other stockholders, as more fully described\nunder the heading \u201c-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u037e\u201d\n\u2022\nTax Treatment. The Board of Directors considered that the receipt of the Merger Consideration will\ngenerally be taxable to stockholders of the Company\u037e and\n\u2022\nImpact on Stakeholders. The Board of Directors considered the potential impact of the Merger on\nemployees, customers, partners and communities, to the extent they may have an impact on the Company,\nand the risks of not closing in a timely manner (including, but not limited to, costs, attrition and disruption\nof the Company\u2019s workforce).\nThe foregoing discussion is not meant to be exhaustive, but summarizes material factors considered by the Board of\nDirectors in its consideration of the Merger. After considering these and other factors, the Board of Directors\nconcluded that the potential benefits of the Merger outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In view of the variety of\nfactors considered by the Board of Directors and the complexity of these factors, the Board of Directors did not find\nit practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its\ndetermination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Board of Directors applied his or her own\npersonal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different weights to different factors. Upon due\nconsideration of these and other factors, the Board of Directors believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the\nMerger to the Company\u2019s stockholders outweighed the risks and uncertainties of the Merger and adopted and\napproved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and\nrecommends that stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger based upon the totality of the\ninformation presented to and considered by the Board of Directors.\nOpinions of the Company Financial Advisors",

            "text": "Opinions of the Company Financial Advisors\nOpinion of Cantor Fitzgerald\nThe Company retained Cantor Fitzgerald to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. In connection\nwith the Merger, Cantor Fitzgerald rendered its opinion to the Board of Directors on September 7, 2021, to the effect\nthat, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions, matters considered and limitations, conditions\nand qualifications described in its opinion, the Common Stock Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by\nholders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates) was fair, from a financial\npoint of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered\nand limitations on the review undertaken by Cantor Fitzgerald. This opinion is attached as Annex C and is\nincorporated herein by reference. Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion was provided for the benefit and use of the Board of\nDirectors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the Merger. Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion\ndid not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors in connection with the Merger, nor did the opinion\nconstitute a recommendation to any holders of Common Stock should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any\nrelated matter. Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion did not address the Company\u2019s underlying business decision to pursue\nthe Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business or financial strategies that\nmight exist for the Company or the effects of any other transaction in which the Company might engage. The\nfollowing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion.\nIn the course of performing its reviews and analyses for rendering its opinion, Cantor Fitzgerald:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated September 7, 2021\u037e\n33TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nreviewed the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, its Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, and its Current Reports on\nForm 8-K filed since December 31, 2020\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain operating and financial information relating to the Company\u2019s business and prospects,\nincluding projections for the Company for the 14 years ended December 31, 2034, all as prepared and\nprovided to Cantor Fitzgerald by the Company\u2019s management\u037e\n\u2022\nmet with certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management to discuss the Company\u2019s business,\noperations, historical and projected financial results and future prospects\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the historical prices and trading volume of the Common Stock\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available financial data, stock market performance data and trading multiples of\ncompanies which Cantor Fitzgerald deemed generally comparable to the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the terms of certain relevant mergers and acquisitions involving companies which Cantor\nFitzgerald deemed generally comparable to the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nperformed a discounted cash flow analysis based on the projections for the Company furnished to Cantor\nFitzgerald by the Company\u2019s management\u037e and\n\u2022\nconducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as Cantor Fitzgerald deemed\nappropriate.\nCantor Fitzgerald relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the\nfinancial and other information provided to or discussed with Cantor Fitzgerald by the Company or obtained by\nCantor Fitzgerald from public sources, including, without limitation, the projections referred to above. With respect to\nthe projections, Cantor Fitzgerald relied on representations that they have been reasonably prepared on bases\nreflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the Company\u2019s senior management as to the\nexpected future performance of the Company. Cantor Fitzgerald did not assume any responsibility for the\nindependent verification of, and did not independently verify, any such information, including, without limitation, the\nprojections\u037e Cantor Fitzgerald expressed no view or opinion as to such projections or the assumptions upon which\nthey were based\u037e and Cantor Fitzgerald further relied upon the assurances of the Company\u2019s senior management that\nit was unaware of any facts that would make the information or projections incomplete or misleading. Cantor\nFitzgerald assumed that the executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft\nreviewed by Cantor Fitzgerald.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Cantor Fitzgerald did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or\nliabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor was Cantor Fitzgerald furnished with any such appraisals.\nCantor Fitzgerald was asked by the Board of Directors to solicit indications of interest from various third parties\nregarding a transaction with the Company, and considered the results of such solicitation in rendering its opinion.\nCantor Fitzgerald assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner and in accordance with the terms\nof the Merger Agreement without any limitations, restrictions, conditions, amendments or modifications, regulatory\nor otherwise, that would be material in any respect to its analysis or its opinion. Cantor Fitzgerald is not a legal,\nregulatory, tax or accounting expert and relied on the assessments made by the Company and its advisors with\nrespect to such issues. Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion did not address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.\nIt was understood that Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion was intended for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors (in\nits capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the Merger, and may not be used for any other purpose,\nreproduced, disseminated, quoted from or referred to at any time, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent\nof Cantor Fitzgerald. However, Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion may be included in its entirety in this proxy statement.\nCantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors in connection with the\nMerger, nor did the opinion constitute a recommendation to any holders of Common Stock should vote or act with\nrespect to the Merger or any related matter. Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion did not address the Company\u2019s underlying\nbusiness decision to pursue the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business or\nfinancial strategies that might exist for the Company or the effects of any other transaction in which the Company\nmight engage. Cantor Fitzgerald did not express any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of\nCommon Stock might trade subsequent to the announcement of the Merger. Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion only\naddressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naffiliates) of the Common Stock Merger Consideration and did not address any other term, aspect or implication of\nthe Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger. In addition, Cantor Fitzgerald did not\nexpress any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation\npayable to or to be received by any of the Company\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons,\nin connection with the Merger relative to the Common Stock Merger Consideration or otherwise.\nCantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion was authorized for issuance by Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s Fairness Opinion and Valuation\nCommittee. Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion was subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other\nconditions contained therein and was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions, and the\ninformation made available to Cantor Fitzgerald, as of the date of its opinion. Cantor Fitzgerald assumed no\nresponsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date of\nCantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion to the Board of Directors, Cantor Fitzgerald performed a variety of financial\nand comparative analyses, which are summarized below. The following summary is not a complete description of all\nanalyses performed and factors considered by Cantor Fitzgerald in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a\nfinancial opinion is a complex process involving subjective judgments and is not necessarily susceptible to partial\nanalysis or summary description. With respect to the selected companies and selected precedent transactions\nanalyses summarized below, no company or transaction used as a comparison was identical to the Company or the\nMerger. These analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and\noperating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or acquisition values of the companies\nconcerned. For purposes of the analyses described below, implied multiples for selected companies and selected\ntransactions that were considered not meaningful or were not publicly available were not included in the high, mean,\nmedian and low multiples for the selected companies and the selected transactions.\nCantor Fitzgerald believes that its analyses and the summary below must be considered as a whole and that selecting\nportions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all\nanalyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s analyses and opinion. Cantor Fitzgerald did not draw, in isolation,\nconclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis for purposes of its opinion, but rather arrived\nat its ultimate opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole.\nThe estimates of the future performance of the Company in or underlying Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s analyses are not\nnecessarily indicative of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those\nestimates. In performing its analyses, Cantor Fitzgerald considered industry performance, general business and\neconomic conditions and other matters, many of which were beyond the control of the Company. Estimates of the\nfinancial value of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or\nsecurities actually may be sold or acquired.\nThe Common Stock Merger Consideration was determined through negotiation between the Company and Sanofi,\nand the decision by the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board of Directors.\nCantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board of\nDirectors in its evaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board of\nDirectors or the Company\u2019s management with respect to the Merger or the consideration payable in the Merger.\nThe following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses performed by Cantor Fitzgerald in connection with\nits opinion. The order in which such summary is presented does not represent the relative importance of such\nanalyses. In addition, the financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In\norder to fully understand Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of\neach summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the\ndata below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies\nand assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s\nfinancial analyses.\nIn the financial analyses summarized below, financial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available\nresearch analysts\u2019 estimates, public filings and other publicly available information, financial data of the selected\ntransactions were based on public filings and other publicly available information, and financial data of the Company\nwere based on internal estimates of the Company\u2019s management provided to Cantor Fitzgerald.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Companies Analysis. Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed selected financial and stock market data of the Company\nand ten selected publicly traded late-stage rare disease biopharmaceutical companies (the \u201cselected companies\u201d).\nCantor Fitzgerald reviewed enterprise values of the selected companies, calculated as fully diluted equity values\nbased on closing stock prices on September 3, 2021, less cash, plus debt, plus non-controlling interest, plus preferred\nequity, plus other contingent liabilities, as multiples of calendar year 2026 estimated revenue (\u201c2026E Revenue\u201d),\nwhich ranged from 0.42x to 4.67x. The mean and median revenue multiples observed in this analysis for the selected\ncompanies were 1.69x and 1.26x, respectively.\nThe selected companies and the financial data reviewed included the following:\nSelected Public Companies\nEnterprise Value / 2026E Revenue Multiple\nAlbireo Pharma, Inc.\n0.67x\nBiocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n4.67x\nCalliditas Therapeutics AB\n0.89x\nChemoCentryx, Inc.\n1.14x\nCorcept Therapeutics Incorporated\n2.93x\nGlobal Blood Therapeutics, Inc.\n1.37x\nInsmed Incorporated\n1.92x\nOmeros Corporation\n1.82x\nRhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n0.42x\nZogenix, Inc.\n1.05x\nCantor Fitzgerald then applied a selected range of 2026E revenue multiples of 1.00x to 3.00x, derived from the selected\ncompanies, to corresponding data of the Company. Cantor Fitzgerald then adjusted for the Company\u2019s estimated\ncash, debt, convertible preferred stock and other liabilities, and divided by the number of fully-diluted shares of\nCommon Stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money\noptions) as of September 3, 2021. This analysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference range for the\nCompany of approximately $2.73 to $7.27, as compared to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial\ninformation for ten selected transactions which involved late-stage rare disease biopharmaceutical target companies.\nCantor Fitzgerald reviewed enterprise values of the selected transactions, calculated as the purchase prices paid for\nthe target companies\u2019 equity (excluding contingent consideration, if any), less cash, plus debt, plus non-controlling\ninterest, plus preferred equity, plus other contingent liabilities, on a standalone basis and as a multiple of estimated\nrevenue for the calendar year approximately five years after the date each transaction was announced (\u201cEstimated 5-\nYear Forward Revenue\u201d).\nThe enterprise values of the selected transactions observed in this analysis ranged from $834 million to $3,365 million,\nand the mean and median enterprise values were $1,743 million and $1,465 million, respectively. The enterprise values\nof the selected transactions as a multiple of Estimated 5-Year Forward Revenue after the date each transaction was\nannounced ranged from 1.67x to 6.73x, and the mean and median enterprise values as a multiple of Estimated 5-Year\nForward Revenue were 3.02x and 2.43x, respectively.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe selected transactions considered, the date each transaction was announced and the financial data reviewed for\neach transaction were as follows:\nAnnouncement\nDate\nAcquiror\nTarget\nEnterprise\nValue \n($ in millions)\nEnterprise Value to \nEstimated 5-Year\nForward \nRevenue Multiple\n02/01/2021\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nViela Bio, Inc.\n$2,674\n3.08x\n08/17/2020\nSanofi\nPrincipia Biopharma Inc.\n$3,365\n6.73x\n05/05/2020\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nPortola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n$1,507\n2.16x\n01/10/2020\nEli Lilly and Company\nDermira, Inc.\n$1,137\n2.16x\n10/10/2019\nUCB S.A.\nRa Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n$2,189\n3.50x\n09/30/2019\nSwedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) Dova Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n$834\n1.74x\n02/25/2019\nIpsen S.A.\nClementia Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n$864\n1.67x\n07/21/2016\nGalenica AG\nRelypsa, Inc.\n$1,424\n2.07x\n11/06/2015\nAstraZeneca plc\nZS Pharma, Inc.\n$2,491\n2.69x\n03/30/2015\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nHyperion Therapeutics, Inc.\n$940\n4.43x\nCantor Fitzgerald applied a selected range of enterprise values of $1,250 million to $2,000 million, derived from the\nselected transactions. Cantor Fitzgerald then adjusted for the Company\u2019s estimated cash, debt, convertible preferred\nstock and other liabilities, and divided by the number of fully-diluted shares of Common Stock (determined using the\ntreasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money options) as of September 3, 2021. This\nanalysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference range for the Company of approximately $6.66 to\n$10.25, as compared to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50.\nCantor Fitzgerald also applied a selected range of 2026E revenue multiples of 2.25x to 4.25x, derived from the selected\ntransactions, to the Company\u2019s 2026E revenue, based on internal estimates of the Company\u2019s management. Cantor\nFitzgerald then adjusted for the Company\u2019s estimated cash, debt, convertible preferred stock and other liabilities, and\ndivided by the number of fully-diluted shares of Common Stock (determined using the treasury stock method and\ntaking into account outstanding in-the-money options) as of September 3, 2021. This analysis indicated an\napproximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for the Company of $5.63 to $10.01, as compared to the\nCommon Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. Cantor Fitzgerald performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company based\non internal estimates provided by the Company\u2019s management and Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s calculation of probability of\nsuccess adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows set forth in \u201c-Company Projections\u201d.\nIn performing this analysis, Cantor Fitzgerald calculated a range of equity values for the Common Stock by (a)\ndiscounting to present value using discount rates ranging from 9.5% to 11.5% (reflecting the Company\u2019s estimated\nweighted average cost of capital, which was derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and a size premium) and\nthe mid-year convention: (i) the forecasted probability of success adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows of the\nCompany over the period beginning on October 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2034, utilized by Cantor\nFitzgerald as set forth in \u201c-Company Projections\u201d and (ii) an implied terminal value of the Company, calculated\nassuming that the Company\u2019s after-tax unlevered free cash flows would decline in perpetuity after December 31, 2034\nat a range of rates of 60% to 10% year-over-year, and (b) adjusting for (1) the Company\u2019s estimated cash, debt,\nconvertible preferred stock and other liabilities and (2) the estimated value of the Company\u2019s early-stage oncology\nplatform based on a select set of companies.\nFor purposes of estimating the value of the Company\u2019s early-stage oncology platform, Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed\nselected financial and stock market data of seven selected early-stage immuno-oncology biopharmaceutical\ncompanies (the \u201cselected immuno-oncology companies\u201d).\nCantor Fitzgerald reviewed enterprise values of the selected immuno-oncology companies, calculated as fully diluted\nequity values based on closing stock prices on September 3, 2021, less cash, plus debt, plus non-controlling interest,\nplus preferred equity, plus other contingent liabilities. The enterprise values of the selected immuno-oncology\ncompanies observed in this analysis ranged from $25 million to $350 million, and the mean and median enterprise\nvalues were $237 million and $281 million, respectively.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe selected immuno-oncology companies and the financial data reviewed included the following:\nSelected Immuno-Oncology Companies\nEnterprise Values ($ in millions)\nCue Biopharma, Inc.\n$321\nGT Biopharma, Inc.\n$242\nIkena Oncology, Inc.\n$290\nNeoleukin Therapeutics, Inc.\n$281\nOncorus, Inc.\n$149\nTScan Therapeutics, Inc.\n$25\nWerewolf Therapeutics, Inc.\n$350\nBased on its analysis of the selected immuno-oncology companies, Cantor Fitzgerald included a selected enterprise\nvalue of $200 million for the Company\u2019s oncology platform.\nUsing the sum of the estimated valuations summarized above, Cantor Fitzgerald then divided by the number of fully-\ndiluted shares of Common Stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding\nin-the-money options) as of September 3, 2021. This analysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference\nrange for the Company of approximately $8.33 to $11.99, as compared to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of\n$9.50.\nOther Information. In rendering its opinion, Cantor Fitzgerald also reviewed and considered the historical trading\nprices of Common Stock during the one-year period ended September 3, 2021, which reflected low and high closing\nprices for Common Stock during such period of $3.15 and $5.73, respectively.\nMiscellaneous\nThe Board of Directors selected Cantor Fitzgerald as one of the Company Financial Advisors in connection with the\nMerger based on Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s reputation as a leading global provider of advisory and capital markets services,\nexperience in the life sciences industry and expertise in mergers and acquisitions, as well as its familiarity with the\nCompany.\nCantor Fitzgerald has acted as a financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a\nfee, based upon a percentage of the transaction value of the Merger, of approximately $15 million, $1.5 million of\nwhich was payable upon delivery of Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion to the Board of Directors and the remaining balance\nof which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify\nCantor Fitzgerald against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.\nDuring the two years preceding the date of Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion, Cantor Fitzgerald has provided certain\ninvestment banking and other services to the Company on matters unrelated to the Merger, including acting as the\nplacement agent for the Company\u2019s ongoing at-the-market offering program, acting as the sole bookrunner for the\nCompany\u2019s private offering of the Convertible Notes in February 2021, executing two block trades on behalf of the\nCompany in October 2019 and May 2020, and acting as the joint bookrunner for the Company\u2019s public offering of\nCommon Stock in November 2019, for which it has received aggregate fees of approximately $6.5 million. During the\ntwo years preceding the date of Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion, Cantor Fitzgerald has not provided any financial\nadvisory or other investment banking services to Sanofi for which Cantor Fitzgerald has received fees.\nConsistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, Cantor Fitzgerald has adopted certain policies and\nprocedures to establish and maintain the independence of Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s research departments and personnel.\nAs a result, Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s research analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations\nand/or publish research reports with respect to the Company, Sanofi, the Merger and other participants in the Merger\nthat differ from the views of Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s investment banking personnel.\nCantor Fitzgerald may seek to provide the Company and Sanofi and their respective affiliates with certain investment\nbanking and other services unrelated to the Merger in the future. In the ordinary course of business, Cantor\nFitzgerald and its affiliates may actively trade (for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers) certain\nequity and debt securities, bank debt and/or other financial instruments issued by the Company and/or Sanofi and\ntheir respective affiliates, as well as derivatives thereof, and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short\npositions in such securities, bank debt, financial instruments and derivatives.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOpinion of Moelis & Company LLC\nAt a meeting of the Board of Directors held on September 7, 2021 to evaluate and approve the Merger, Moelis\nrendered its oral opinion to the Board of Directors, confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion dated September 7,\n2021, addressed to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and\nsubject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken,\nthe Common Stock Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by the holders of Common Stock (other than\nSanofi and its affiliates and holders of Excluded Shares) was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of Moelis\u2019 written opinion dated September 7, 2021, which sets forth the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is\nattached as Annex D to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference.

With the consent of the Board of Directors, Moelis relied upon, without independent verification,\nthe assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax,\nregulatory and accounting matters. With respect to the Financial Forecasts, Moelis assumed, at the direction of the\nBoard of Directors, that they were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\navailable estimates and judgments of the Company\u2019s management as to the future performance of the Company. In\naddition, with the consent of the Board of Directors, Moelis relied on the assessments of the management of the\nCompany as to the existing pharmaceutical products then under development by the Company and the validity of,\nand risks associated with, the then existing and future products of the Company, including the risks and timing of\nregulatory approvals and commercialization of such products. Moelis expressed no view as to the reasonableness of\nthe Financial Forecasts and other financial forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, with\nthe consent of the Board of Directors, Moelis did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the\nassets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or otherwise) of the Company, nor was Moelis\nfurnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.\nMoelis\u2019 opinion did not address the Company\u2019s underlying business decision to effect the Merger or the relative\nmerits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to the\nCompany and did not address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. At the direction of the Board of\nDirectors, Moelis was not asked to, nor did it, offer any opinion as to any terms of the Merger Agreement or any\naspect or implication of the Merger, except for the fairness of the Common Stock Merger Consideration from a\nfinancial point of view to the holders of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates and holders of Excluded\nShares). Moelis did not express any opinion as to fair value or the solvency of the Company following the closing of\nthe Merger. Moelis noted that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Excluded Shares will not be converted into the\nright to receive the Merger Consideration, and Moelis expressed no opinion with respect to such shares or as to the\nfairness of the Merger Consideration to holders thereof. In addition, Moelis expressed no opinion with respect to the\ntreatment of the Preferred Stock in the Transaction, or the fairness of the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration\nrelative to the treatment of such Preferred Stock. In rendering its opinion, Moelis assumed, with the consent of the\nBoard of Directors, that the final executed form of the Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from\nthe draft that Moelis reviewed, that the Merger would be consummated in accordance with its terms without any\nwaiver or modification that could be material to Moelis\u2019 analysis, that the representations and warranties of each\nparty contained in the Merger Agreement were true and correct and that the parties to the Merger Agreement would\ncomply with all the material terms of the Merger Agreement. Moelis assumed, with the consent of the Board of\nDirectors, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents or approvals necessary for the completion of the\nMerger would be obtained, except to the extent that could not be material to Moelis\u2019 analysis.\nMoelis\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to Moelis as of, the date of its opinion, and Moelis assumed no responsibility to update\nits opinion for developments after the date of its opinion.\nMoelis\u2019 opinion did not address the fairness of the Merger or any aspect or implication of the Merger to, or any other\nconsideration of or relating to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the\nCompany, other than the fairness of the Common Stock Merger Consideration from a financial point of view to the\nholders of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates and holders of Excluded Shares). In addition, Moelis did\nnot express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any\nofficers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger\nConsideration or otherwise. Moelis\u2019 opinion was approved by a Moelis fairness opinion committee.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared by Moelis for the Board of Directors in\nconnection with rendering its written opinion, dated September 7, 2021. Some of the summaries of financial analyses\nbelow include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Moelis\u2019 analyses, the tables must\nbe read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the\nanalyses. Considering the data described below without considering the full narrative description of the financial\nanalyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of Moelis\u2019 analyses.\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, stock prices are based on closing stock prices on September 2, 2021. For\npurposes of, among other things, deriving per share implied equity values for the Company, Moelis calculated certain\nper share amounts for the Company based on diluted shares outstanding as of September 3, 2021 provided by\nCompany management and approved for use by Moelis in rendering its opinion.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor purposes of its analyses, Moelis reviewed a number of financial metrics, including the following:\n\u2022\nEBIT: generally calculated as the relevant company\u2019s earnings before interest and taxes, as adjusted to\nexclude one-time charges and benefits and to reflect the full-year impact of material corporate transactions.\n\u2022\nTotal Enterprise Value (\u201cTEV\u201d): which (i) with respect to the Company, was calculated as the market value of\nthe Company\u2019s fully diluted common equity based on its closing stock prices on September 2, 2021 and\nshare count information as of September 3, 2021 provided by the Company management and approved by\nCompany management for use by Moelis in rendering its opinion, plus (a) the Preferred Stock, plus (b) the\nConvertible Notes, less (c) cash and cash equivalents, and (ii) with respect to other companies, was\ncalculated as the market value of the relevant company\u2019s fully diluted common equity based on its closing\nstock price as of September 2, 2021, plus (a) preferred stock, plus (b) debt, less (c) cash and cash\nequivalents (in each of the foregoing clauses (a) through (c), as of the relevant company\u2019s most recently\nreported quarter end).\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, (i) the estimates of the future financial performance for the selected publicly\ntraded companies listed below were based on certain publicly available research analyst estimates for those\ncompanies, and (ii) the estimates of the future financial performance of the Company relied upon for the financial\nanalyses described below were based on the Financial Forecasts.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMoelis performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company using the Financial Forecasts and other\ninformation and data provided by the Company\u2019s management to calculate the present value of the estimated future\nprobability-adjusted unlevered after-tax free cash flows projected to be generated by the Company and the present\nvalue of the Company\u2019s estimated terminal value, taking into account the estimated December 31, 2021 cash balance\n(net of debt) and the present value of the Company\u2019s federal and state net operating losses and federal research and\ndevelopment tax credits.\nMoelis utilized a range of discount rates of 8.25% to 10.75% based on an estimated range of the Company\u2019s weighted\naverage cost of capital (\u201cWACC\u201d). The estimated WACC range was derived using the Capital Assets Pricing Model\nand a size premium. Moelis used the foregoing range of discount rates to calculate the present values as of December\n31, 2021 of (i) the Company\u2019s estimated after-tax unlevered free cash flows for calendar years 2022 through 2034 (in\neach case, discounted using the mid-year discounting convention to a transaction date of December 31, 2021) and (ii)\nthe estimated terminal values derived by applying a perpetuity growth rate range of (75%) to (25%) to the Company\u2019s\nestimated terminal year after-tax unlevered free cash flow, which were added to the Company\u2019s estimated December\n31, 2021 net cash balance for purposes of determining equity and per share value.\nBased on the foregoing, Moelis derived implied per share value ranges for the Common Stock of $8.50 to $12.21 per\nshare. Moelis compared the implied per share value range to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per\nshare.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis\nMoelis conducted a sum-of-the-parts selected publicly traded companies analysis by separately reviewing financial\nand stock market information relating to selected publicly traded companies that, in Moelis\u2019 professional judgment,\nhave products similar to the Company\u2019s KD025 product and its immuno-oncology platform. Based on its professional\njudgment and experience, Moelis selected publicly traded companies which are (1) biopharma companies with a\nsingle lead molecule that was recently approved or filed, targeting niche, specialty or orphan market opportunities\nand that otherwise have assets with a similar technology profile to the Company\u2019s lead product and deemed generally\nrelevant by Moelis in certain respects to the Company (such companies, the \u201cKD025 Group\u201d) or (2) platform immuno-\noncology companies in Phase 1 or earlier with a core technology focus on small molecule and/or antibody programs\nand deemed generally relevant by Moelis in certain respects to the Company (the \u201cIO Platform Group\u201d). The\nfollowing table indicates the companies reviewed by Moelis with respect to each of these groups:\nKD025 Group\nIO Platform Group\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nCodiak BioSciences, Inc.\nBioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nCue Biopharma, Inc.\nCalliditas Therapeutics\nFusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nChemoCentryx, Inc.\nGT Biopharma, Inc.\nGlobal Blood Therapeutics, Inc.\nNeoleukin Therapeutics, Inc.\nInsmed, Inc.\nPieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nOmeros Corporation\nWerewolf Therapeutics, Inc.\nPharming Group N.V.\nPhathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nFinancial data for the selected companies was based on publicly available consensus research analyst estimates,\npublic filings and other publicly available information and included, as appropriate, pro forma adjustments for\nacquisitions and divestitures, unfunded pension liabilities or other corporate events, which are referred to\ncollectively as the \u201cpro forma adjustments,\u201d to the extent applicable. In the case of estimated TEV and 2026 Sales for\nthe Company, Moelis reviewed both median consensus research analyst estimates and the Financial Forecasts.\nAlthough none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, the companies included were\nselected because they are companies that, for purposes of analysis, had certain operational and financial\ncharacteristics that may be considered reasonably comparable in certain respects to the Company.\nMoelis reviewed, among other things, the TEV of each of the each of the companies in the KD025 Group, each\ncompany in the KD025 Group\u2019s median consensus estimates of sales for calendar year 2026 (\u201c2026 Sales\u201d) and the\nTEV of each of the KD025 Group companies as a multiple of 2026 Sales. The following table summarizes the results of\nthe analysis of the selected companies in the KD025 Group:\nKD025 Group\nTEV \n($ in \nmillions)\nTEV / \n2026\nSales\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n2,026\n1.8x\nBioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The following table summarizes the results of the analysis of the\nselected companies in the IO Platform Group:\nIO Platform Group\nTEV \n($ in \nmillions)\nCodiak BioSciences, Inc.\n334\nCue Biopharma, Inc.\n337\nFusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n222\nGT Biopharma, Inc.\n178\nNeoleukin Therapeutics, Inc.\n283\nPieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n320\nWerewolf Therapeutics, Inc.\n347\nMean\n289\nMedian\n320\nIn reviewing the characteristics of the selected publicly traded companies in the KD025 Group for purposes of\ndetermining reference ranges to apply to the Company\u2019s estimated financial metrics, Moelis noted that its estimate of\na range of total enterprise values for the Company\u2019s KD025 asset as a stand-alone business was informed by a review\nof the mean and median TEV of the KD025 Group and its estimate of a range of total TEV/2026 Sales multiples for the\nCompany\u2019s KD025 asset as a stand-alone business was informed by a review of the TEV/2026 Sales multiples of each\ncompany in the KD025 Group. While considered, Moelis did not utilize data for ChemoCentryx and Calliditas in its\ndetermination of the TEV/2026 Sales multiple reference range because Moelis, in its professional judgment, assessed\nthat those companies had faced recent clinical development challenges which made them not comparable to the\nCompany. In addition, while considered, Moelis did not utilize data for BioCryst in its determination of the TEV/2026\nSales multiple reference range because Moelis, in its professional judgment, assessed that BioCryst\u2019s multiple strong\nquarters of commercial execution on ORLADEYO and robust pipeline made it not comparable to the Company. Based\non the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Moelis selected (i) a reference range for\nestimated TEV/2026 Sales multiples for the Company\u2019s KD025 asset as a stand-alone business of 1.50x to 2.25x and\n(ii) a reference range of TEV for the Company\u2019s KD025 asset as a stand-alone business of $1 billion to $2 billion.\nIn reviewing the characteristics of the selected publicly traded companies in the IO Platform Group for purposes of\ndetermining its reference ranges to apply to the Company\u2019s estimated financial metrics, Moelis noted that its estimate\nof a range of total enterprise values for the Company\u2019s IO Platform assets as a stand-alone business was informed by\na review of the mean and median TEV of each company in the IO Platform Group. Moelis further noted that certain\nother platform immuno-oncology companies were excluded from the IO Platform Group because such companies have\nmultiple ongoing clinical programs or platform validating partnerships with larger pharmaceutical companies. Based\non the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Moelis selected a reference range of TEV for\nthe Company\u2019s IO Platform assets as a stand-alone business of $175 million to $350 million.\nMoelis then (i) applied the reference range for estimated TEV/2026 Sales multiples to the Company\u2019s estimated 2026\nSales as set forth in the Company Projections to calculate an implied enterprise value for the Company\u2019s KD025 asset\nand (ii) added the reference range of enterprise value for the Company\u2019s IO Platform assets on a stand-alone basis to\ngenerate an implied TEV for the Company. This analysis indicated an implied per share value ranges for the Common\nStock of $4.73 to $7.25 per share. Moelis compared the implied per share value ranges to the Common Stock Merger\nConsideration of $9.50 per share.\nMoelis also (1) applied the reference range for the enterprise value of the Company\u2019s KD025 asset as a stand-alone\nbusiness and (2) added the reference range of enterprise value for the Company\u2019s IO Platform assets on a stand-alone\nbasis to generate an implied TEV for the Company. This analysis indicated an implied per share value ranges for the\nCommon Stock of $6.24 to $11.74 per share. Moelis compared the implied per share value ranges to the Common Stock\nMerger Consideration of $9.50 per share.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis\nMoelis reviewed financial information for selected precedent transactions announced since 2015 involving acquired\ncompanies that focused on niche or orphan market opportunities, that had its lead program in late-stage clinical trials\nor approved and/or that had a lead asset with a similar technology profile to the Company\u2019s lead asset, which Moelis\ndetermined, in its professional judgment and experience, were generally relevant in certain respects to the Company\n(the \u201cSelected Precedent Transactions\u201d). Moelis reviewed, among other things, transaction values of the Selected\nPrecedent Transactions and enterprise value as a multiple of CY+5 Sales for each Selected Precedent Transaction. For\npurposes of this summary, \u201cCY+5 Sales\u201d means estimated sales amounts (i) for marketed companies, in the applicable\ncalendar year plus five years or (ii) for clinical-stage companies, assumed launch plus five years, in each case, based\non the public filings made by each of the acquired companies (with the exception of Clementia Pharmaceutical Inc.,\nwhich is based on equity research estimates at the time of the transaction announcement) in connection with the\napplicable Selected Precedent Transaction. Financial data for the relevant transactions were based on publicly\navailable information relating to the relevant transaction.\nThe Selected Precedent Transactions used in this analysis and their implied TEV to CY+5 Sales multiples are\nsummarized in the following table:\nDate Announced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nTransaction\nValue ($ in\nmillions)\nTEV /\nCalendar\nYear +5\nSales\nFebruary 2021\nHorizon Therapeutics plc (\u201cHorizon\u201d)\nViela Bio, Inc.

Moelis also noted that in reviewing the characteristics of the Selected Precedent Transactions for\npurposes of selecting reference ranges of multiples to CY+5 Sales to apply to the Company\u2019s estimated financial\nmetrics, Moelis\u2019 reference range was informed by the Selected Precedent Transactions, other than the (i)\nHorizon/Viela transaction since Viela was acquired at a premium due to its deep mid-stage biologics pipeline, and (ii)\nBridgeBio/Eidos transaction since Eidos was acquired at a premium due to the value of its discovery platform.\nBased on the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Moelis selected (i) a reference range\nof 1.50x to 3.00x TEV / CY+5 Sales multiples and (ii) a reference range for the Company\u2019s TEV of $1.5 billion to $2.5\nbillion. Moelis then applied the reference range for estimated CY+5 Sales multiples to the Company\u2019s estimated 2026\nSales as set forth in the Financial Forecasts, which analysis indicated an implied per share value range for the\nCommon Stock of $3.85 to $7.23 per share. Moelis compared the implied per share value ranges to the Common Stock\nMerger Consideration of $9.50 per share.\nMoelis also applied the reference range for the Company\u2019s implied enterprise value which analysis indicated an\nimplied per share value range for the Common Stock of $7.82 to $12.35 per share. Moelis compared the implied per\nshare value ranges to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOther Information\nMoelis also noted for the Board of Directors the following additional factors that were not considered part of Moelis\u2019\nfinancial analyses with respect to its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes: (i) the historic intraday\ntrading prices for the Common Stock during the 52-week period ended September 2, 2021, which reflected low and\nhigh stock prices during such period of $3.15 and $5.73 per share, as compared to the Common Stock Merger\nConsideration of $9.50 per share, (ii) the one-year forward stock price targets for the Common Stock in recently\npublished, publicly available equity research analysts\u2019 reports, which indicated low and high stock price targets\nranging from $9.00 to $20.00 per share, as compared to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share,\nand (iii) an analysis of unaffected premiums paid since January 1, 2019 in 25 acquisitions in the biotech industry with\na transaction size in excess of $1 billion and excluding transactions in which the acquirer held an existing stake -\nbased on such premiums paid analysis, Moelis applied a reference range of premia from 60% to 80% to the\nCompany\u2019s closing share price on September 2, 2021, which resulted in an implied low and high per share value range\nfor the Common Stock of $8.66 to $9.74 per share, as compared to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50\nper share.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing is a summary of the analyses undertaken by Moelis in connection with Moelis\u2019 opinion. The\npreparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis\nor summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or summary set forth above, without considering the\nanalyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Moelis\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its\nfairness determination, Moelis considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight\nto any factor or analysis. Rather, Moelis made its fairness determination on the basis of its experience and\nprofessional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the\nanalyses described above is identical to the Company or the Merger. In addition, such analyses do not purport to be\nappraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses\nbased upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Because the analyses described above are\ninherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or\ntheir respective advisors, neither the Company nor Moelis or any other person assumes responsibility if future\nresults are materially different from those forecast.\nThe Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and Sanofi and\nwas approved by the Board of Directors. Moelis did not recommend any specific consideration to the Company or\nthe Board of Directors, or that any specific amount or type of consideration constituted the only appropriate\nconsideration for the transaction. The Board of Directors selected Moelis as one of its financial advisors in\nconnection with the Merger based on Moelis\u2019 reputation and experience. Moelis is an internationally recognized\ninvestment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter\nagreement dated August 13, 2021, Moelis acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger\nand will receive a fee for its services, estimated to be approximately $15 million in the aggregate based on the\ninformation available as of the date of announcement of the Merger, $1.5 million of which was earned in connection\nwith the delivery of Moelis\u2019 opinion dated September 7, 2021, in connection with the Board of Directors\u2019\nconsideration of the Merger, regardless of the conclusion reached therein, and the remainder of which is contingent\nupon completion of the Merger. Furthermore, the Company has agreed to reimburse Moelis for certain expenses and\nto indemnify Moelis for certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its\nengagement.\nMoelis\u2019 affiliates, employees, officers and partners may at any time own securities (long or short) of the Company and\nSanofi. In the past two years, Moelis has not provided investment banking or other services to the Company or\nSanofi. Moelis may, in the future, provide investment banking or other services to the Company, Sanofi or other\nparties involved in the Merger and would expect to receive compensation for such services.\nCompany Projections",

The summary of the Company Projections is\nincluded solely to give stockholders of the Company access to certain financial projections that were made available\nto, and relied upon by, the Board of Directors, Cantor Fitzgerald and Moelis.\nAlthough a summary of the Company Projections is presented with numerical specificity, the Company Projections\nreflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by the Company\u2019s management that\nmanagement believed were reasonable at the time the Company Projections were prepared, taking into account the\nrelevant information available to the Company\u2019s management at the time. However, this information should not be\nrelied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results\nand cause the Company Projections not to be achieved include general economic conditions, regulatory conditions,\nfinancial market conditions, the Company\u2019s ability to achieve forecasted sales, accuracy of certain accounting\nassumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures and changes in tax laws or accounting\ntreatment. The Company Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to\nchange. In addition, the Company Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after\nthe date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the\nCompany Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the\nCompany Projections. The Company Projections cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes\nless reliable with each successive year.\nThe inclusion of the Company Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the\nBoard of Directors, the Company, Cantor Fitzgerald, Moelis or any of their respective affiliates or representatives or\nany other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Company Projections to be predictive of\nactual future results. The summary of the Company Projections is not included in this proxy statement in order to\ninduce any stockholder to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the\nSpecial Meeting or for any other purpose. We do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Company Projections\nto reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the\nevent that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Company Projections are shown to be in error or no longer\nappropriate, except as otherwise required by law. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in\nthe Company Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the projections included in this\nproxy statement.\nNone of the Company, Sanofi or any of their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives has\nmade or makes any representation to any Company stockholder or other person regarding the ultimate performance\nof the Company compared to the information contained in the Company Projections or that the Company Projections\nwill be achieved. The Company has made no representation to Sanofi or Merger Sub, in the Merger Agreement or\notherwise, concerning the Company Projections.\nThe Company Projections and the accompanying tables contain PoS (probability of success) adjusted net sales\nrevenue, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and unlevered free cash flow, each of which may be considered a\nnon-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The Company\nbelieves these measures are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and future results. These\nfinancial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measure\nand should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP.\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Company Projections include assumptions related to revenue, costs and cash flows:\n\u2022\nThe Company Projections contain revenue projections for REZUROCKTM (belumosudil) in chronic Graft-\nVersus-Host-Disease (cGVHD), belumosudil in Systemic Sclerosis (SSC) and other revenues, which are\nbased on key revenue-related assumptions, including but not limited to: (1) product launch year, (2) patient\nprevalence population growth and addressable patient percentage of prevalence, (3) peak market\npenetration and time to achieve peak, (4) loss of exclusivity, and (5) pricing and reimbursement. In addition,\nrevenue for each of the Company\u2019s programs was adjusted for PoS by multiplying management\u2019s view of\nthe likelihood percentage of success by the revenue in each time period as follows: (1) 100% PoS for\nREZUROCK-GVHD revenues in the United States, (2) 80% PoS for REZUROCK-GVHD revenues in non-US\nmarkets, and (3) 15% PoS for belumosudil-SSC revenues globally. The Company Projections did not contain\nrevenue projections for the Company\u2019s immune and fibrotic disease pipeline candidates, given the early\nnature of such programs, or its immuno-oncology platform, as such platform was analyzed by each of\nCantor Fitzgerald and Moelis separately, as directed by Company management, through selected public\ncompanies and/or selected precedent transactions analysis (see \u201c-Opinions of the Company Financial\nAdvisors\u201d).\n\u2022\nKey cost assumptions include assumptions related to cost of goods sold, sales and marketing costs, and\nresearch and development costs. The resulting cost projections for each of the Company\u2019s programs was\nadjusted for the relevant in-phase PoS, if applicable. In addition, tax expense was estimated using a 26%\ncombined state and federal tax rate.\n\u2022\nKey cash flow assumptions include assumptions related to capital expenditures, depreciation and\namortization and net working capital needs.\nThe following table summarizes the Company Projections. The Company Projections are forward-looking statements.\nFor information on factors that may cause the Company\u2019s future results to materially vary, see the information under\nthe section

Waksal, M.D.,\nSteven Meehan, and Gregory S. Moss, our executive officers. On September 7, 2021, in connection with the approval\nof the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Board approved certain amendments to the\nEmployment Agreements. The following descriptions of the terms of the Employment Agreements, as amended, with\nour executive officers are intended as a summary only and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the\nemployment agreements filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020,\nwhich was filed with the SEC on March 4, 2021, and the amendments to the Employment Agreements that were filed\nas exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 8, 2021.\nThe Employment Agreements, as amended, provide for the payment of retention bonuses in the amount of $3,500,000\nto Dr. Waksal, $1,000,000 to Mr. Meehan and $1,000,000 to Mr. Moss (the \u201cRetention Bonuses\u201d). The Retention\nBonuses were paid 25% on the date the Merger Agreement was fully executed and the remaining 75% will be earned\non the Closing Date, subject to the executive\u2019s continuous and active employment with the Company through such\ndate unless his employment is terminated without Cause or he resigns with Good Reason (as such terms are defined\nin the Employment Agreements, as amended) prior to such date.\nThe Employment Agreements, as amended, also provide for severance payments to Dr. Waksal and Messrs. Meehan\nand Moss in the event the executive\u2019s employment is terminated without Cause, or he resigns with Good Reason, in\neither case during the three months prior to, as of, or within 12 months following the effective date of a Change in\nControl (as defined in the executive\u2019s employment agreement as amended). If Dr. Waksal\u2019s employment is so\nterminated, he will be entitled to receive severance in the form of a lump sum payment equal to 36 months\u2019 base salary\nplus the target bonus amount and continued healthcare coverage for 36 months. If Mr. Meehan\u2019s or Mr. Moss\u2019s\nemployment is so terminated, he will be entitled to receive severance in the form of a lump payment equal to 24\nmonths\u2019 base salary plus the target bonus amount and continued healthcare coverage for 24 months. In addition, the\nEmployment Agreements, as amended, provide that all outstanding equity grants will accelerate and vest upon the\nearlier of the date such executive\u2019s employment is terminated or the closing date of a Change in Control. The\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany will also pay each such executive a tax gross-up payment in respect of any excise taxes incurred by such\nexecutive under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code that are triggered as a result of the consummation of a\nChange in Control.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to \u201cU.S. holders\u201d and\n\u201cnon-U.S. holders\u201d (each as defined below) whose shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are converted into the\nright to receive cash in the Merger. This summary is for general information purposes only and does not purport to\nconsider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to our stockholders. This discussion is\nbased the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), existing and temporary U.S. Treasury regulations\npromulgated thereunder, judicial opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal\nRevenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), each as in effect as of the date hereof. These laws and authorities are subject to change\nor differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could affect the accuracy of the\nstatements and conclusions set forth in this summary. As a result, the Company cannot assure stockholders that the\ntax considerations described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or would be sustained by a court if\nchallenged by the IRS. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS or any tax opinion of\ncounsel with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. Accordingly, the\ndiscussion below neither binds the IRS nor precludes it from adopting a contrary position.\nThe summary applies only to beneficial owners who hold shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock as capital\nassets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes), and does\nnot address the tax considerations for holders of Common Stock or Preferred Stock subject to special treatment under\nU.S. federal income tax law, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\npartnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities (or treated as such for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes)\u037e\n\u2022\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\n\u2022\ntax-exempt organizations, mutual funds and pension funds\u037e\n\u2022\nindividual retirement accounts\u037e\n\u2022\ninsurance companies\u037e\n\u2022\ndealers or traders in securities or foreign currency\u037e\n\u2022\npersons who (i) acquired their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock through the exercise of options\nor similar derivative securities or otherwise as compensation, or (ii) acquired their shares of Common Stock\nor Preferred Stock through a tax-qualified retirement plan or other tax-deferred accounts\u037e\n\u2022\npersons whose shares of Common Stock are qualified small business stock for purposes of Section 1202 of\nthe Code\u037e\n\u2022\npersons whose shares of Common Stock are \u201cSection 1244 stock\u201d for purposes of Section 1244 of the\nCode\u037e\n\u2022\npersons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\npersons who hold their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock as part of a hedge, appreciated financial\nposition, straddle or conversion transaction\u037e\n\u2022\npersons who have acquired their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock in a transaction subject to\ngain rollover provisions of Section 1045 of the Code\u037e\n\u2022\npersons who have entered into a constructive sale of their Common Stock or Preferred Stock under the\nCode\u037e\n\u2022\na controlled foreign corporation\u037e\n\u2022\na passive foreign investment company\u037e or\n\u2022\na U.S. expatriate.\n52TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThis summary does not address any aspect of state, local or non-U.S. tax laws, any estate or gift tax considerations,\nthe application of the alternative minimum tax or any U.S. federal non-income taxes (including, for example, the\nMedicare contribution tax on net investment income that may be imposed under the Code) or any other form of\ntaxation that may be applicable to a stockholder. Furthermore, it generally does not address the tax consequences of\ntransactions effectuated before, after, or at the same time as the Merger, whether or not they are in connection with\nthe Merger. Finally, this summary does not address the tax considerations to holders of Company Equity Awards with\nrespect to their Company Equity Awards. Accordingly, Company stockholders are urged to consult their own tax\nadvisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the Merger, including the applicable federal, state, local, and\nnon-U.S. tax laws.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)\nholds Common Stock or Preferred Stock, the tax treatment of a partner of such partnership (or member of such other\nentity treated as a partnership) generally will depend on the status of the partner (or member) and the activities of the\npartner (or member) and the partnership (or such other entity treated as a partnership). A partner of a partnership (or\nmember of such other entity treated as a partnership) holding Common Stock or Preferred Stock should consult the\npartner (or member)\u2019s tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to such partner\n(or member).\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this summary, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d is any beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock\nthat is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual citizen or resident of the United States or someone treated as a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or\norganized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\na trust that (i) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or\nmore U.S. persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (ii) has a valid election in\neffect under applicable Code and U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes\u037e or\n\u2022\nan estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.\nThe exchange of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock for cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder whose shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are\nconverted into the right to receive cash in the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares\n(determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes, as described below under \u201c-Backup\nWithholding and Information Reporting\u201d) and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis will generally equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. The amount, character, and\ntiming of such gain or loss generally will be determined separately with respect to each block of stock owned by such\nU.S. holder. For purposes of the foregoing, a block of stock is generally composed of those shares of a particular\nclass of stock of a company that were acquired at the same time and at the same price. Each U.S. holder should\nconsult such U.S. Holder\u2019s tax advisors regarding the manner in which any cash received pursuant to the Merger\nshould be allocated among the U.S. Holder\u2019s respective different blocks of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock.\nAny capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss, provided that the U.S. holder\u2019s holding period for such\nshares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock is more than 12 months at the Effective Time and otherwise should be\nshort-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders are generally subject to a\nreduced tax rate and short-term capital gains are generally subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates. There are\nlimitations on the deductibility of capital losses.\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNon-U.S. Holders\nA \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that is not a U.S. holder or a\npartnership (or any other entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes).\nIn such case, a non-U.S. holder whose shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are exchanged for cash in the\nMerger generally is not expected to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on such sale or\nexchange unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder\u2019s trade or business within\nthe United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable\nyear of the exchange of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger and\ncertain other conditions are met\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than\n5% of the Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Common Stock basis at any time\nduring the five-year period preceding the Merger and the Company is or has been a \u201cUnited States real\nproperty holding corporation\u201d within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or the period that\nthe non-U.S. holder held Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Common Stock\nbasis.\nA non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income\ntax on any gain realized as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder, subject to an applicable income tax treaty\nproviding otherwise. If such non-U.S. holder is a corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to\n30% (or a lower treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for\ncertain items. A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and\nsuch non-U.S. holder\u2019s country of residence) on any gain realized, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses,\nif any, provided that the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.\nWe believe we are not and have not been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes at any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nBackup withholding of tax (currently at the rate of 24%) may apply to cash payments to which a non-corporate U.S.\nholder is entitled under the Merger Agreement, unless such U.S. holder provides a taxpayer identification number,\ncertifies that such number is correct and it is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9, and otherwise\ncomplies with the backup withholding rules. Each of our U.S. holders that is a stockholder of record should complete\nand sign, under penalty of perjury, the Form W-9 included as part of the letter of transmittal and return it to the\nExchange Agent, in order to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding, unless\nan exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the Exchange Agent. A non-U.S. holder that is a\nstockholder of record and provides the Exchange Agent with the applicable Form W-8 providing certification of non-\nU.S. status (such as a Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or another appropriate version of Form W-8) will generally establish\nan exemption from backup withholding. A U.S. holder that fails to provide its correct taxpayer identification number\nand the appropriate certifications, fail to establish an exemption as described above, or falsely certifies that it is not\nsubject to backup withholding generally will be subject to backup withholding and may be subject to penalties\nimposed by the IRS.\nAmounts withheld pursuant to the backup withholding rules are not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from\ncash payments to a stockholder pursuant to the Merger under the backup withholding rules will generally be\nallowable as a refund or a credit against such stockholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS. If there is withholding on a payment to a U.S. holder and the withholding\nresults in an overpayment of taxes, the affected U.S. holder should consult with such U.S. holder\u2019s own tax advisor\nregarding whether and how any refund might be obtained with respect to the amounts so withheld.\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences described above are for general information purposes only and are not\nintended to constitute a complete description of all tax consequences relating to the Merger. Because individual\ncircumstances may differ, each stockholder should consult the stockholder\u2019s tax advisor regarding the applicability\nof the rules discussed above to the stockholder, the particular tax effects to the stockholder of the Merger in light of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s particular circumstances and the application of state, local and foreign tax laws, if applicable.\nRegulatory Approvals",

            "text": "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThis section describes the material terms of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this\nsection and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the\ncomplete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference\ninto this proxy statement. You are encouraged to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety before\nmaking any decisions regarding the Merger, including approval of the Merger Proposal, as it is the legal document\ngoverning the Merger. This section is not intended to provide you with any factual information about the Company,\nSanofi or Merger Sub. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the public filings the\nCompany makes with the SEC, as described under the heading \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d\nbeginning on page 85 of this proxy statement.\nExplanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The rights and obligations of the\nparties under the Merger Agreement are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this\nsummary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by Sanofi, Merger Sub and the Company in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of\nmateriality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases\nwere qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Sanofi and Merger Sub by the Company in connection with the\nMerger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement\nfor the purpose of allocating contractual risk between the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub rather than to establish\nmatters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those\napplicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not\nrely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of\nthe actual state of facts or condition of the Company, Sanofi or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change\nafter the Agreement Date. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual\nlimitations on the respective businesses of the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub, because the parties may take\ncertain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential Company disclosure letter to the Merger\nAgreement (the \u201cCompany Disclosure Letter\u201d) or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent\nmay be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A,\nonly to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual\ninformation regarding the Company, Sanofi, Merger Sub or their respective businesses.

The Company will be the Surviving Corporation in the\nMerger, will become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Sanofi and will continue to exist following the Merger. As\na result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company. In addition, the Common Stock will\nsubsequently be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file\nperiodic reports with the SEC.\nAt the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and\nrestated as provided in the Merger Agreement. The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation will, from and\nafter the Effective Time, be the individuals who are the directors and officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to\nthe Effective Time.\n56TABLE OF CONTENTS\nClosing and Effective Time\nThe closing of the Merger will take place no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the\nconditions to closing of the Merger (described below under the caption \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Conditions to the\nClosing of the Merger\u201d) (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the\nMerger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing of the Merger) or such other time\nagreed to in writing by Sanofi and us. At the closing of the Merger, the Company will file a certificate of merger with\nthe Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL.

This means that you are\nentitled to have the fair value of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock determined by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery and to receive payment based on that valuation in lieu of the Merger Consideration if you follow exactly\nthe procedures specified under the DGCL. The ultimate amount you receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less\nthan, equal to or more than the amount you would have received under the Merger Agreement.\nTo exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is\ntaken on the Merger Agreement and you must not vote (either in person or by proxy) in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in\nthe loss of your appraisal rights. See \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 79 and the text of the Delaware appraisal\nrights statute reproduced in its entirety as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Common\nStock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult\nwith your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand\nfor appraisal by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.\nTHE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE\nWITH TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD\nCONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION\n262 OF THE DGCL, THE FULL TEXT OF WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT AS ANNEX B.\nRepresentations and Warranties\nThe Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub.\nSome of the representations and

The Company\u2019s stockholders who elect to exercise appraisal rights must not\nvote in favor of the Merger Proposal and must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (\u201cSection 262\u201d)\nin order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 is required. Failure to\nfollow precisely any of the statutory requirements will result in the loss of your appraisal rights.\nThis section is intended as a brief summary of certain provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures that a\nstockholder must follow in order to seek and perfect appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a complete\nstatement of all applicable requirements, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the\nfull text of which appears in Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The following\nsummary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders\nexercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.\nSection 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, as in\nthe case of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, the stockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be\navailable not less than 20 days before the meeting to vote on the Merger. A copy of Section 262 must be included\nwith such notice. This proxy statement constitutes the Company\u2019s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are\navailable in connection with the Merger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider\nexercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in Annex B. Failure to\ncomply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the loss of your appraisal rights under\nthe DGCL.\nIf you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, you must satisfy each of the\nfollowing conditions: You must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Common\nStock or Preferred Stock before the vote is taken on the Merger Proposal, which must reasonably inform us of the\nidentity of the holder of record of the Company\u2019s Common Stock or Preferred Stock and that the stockholder intends\nthereby to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, and you must not vote or\nsubmit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal.\nIf you fail to comply with either of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the\napplicable Merger Consideration for your shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock or Preferred Stock as provided for\nin the Merger Agreement, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of the Company\u2019s\nCommon Stock or Preferred Stock. A holder of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock or Preferred Stock wishing to\nexercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock on the date the written\ndemand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of record\nthrough the Effective Time, because appraisal rights will be lost if the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are\ntransferred prior to the Effective Time. Voting against or failing to vote for the Merger Proposal by itself does not\nconstitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain\nvoting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, and it will constitute a waiver of\nthe stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.\nTherefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must either submit a proxy\ncontaining instructions to vote against the Merger Proposal or abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal. The\nwritten demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal.\nAll demands for appraisal should be addressed to Kadmon Holdings, Inc., 450 East 29th Street, New York, NY 10016,\nand must be delivered before the vote is taken on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting, and should be\nexecuted by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock. The demand must\nreasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand\nappraisal of his, her or its shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock.\n79TABLE OF CONTENTS\nTo be effective, a demand for appraisal by a stockholder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock must be made by, or in\nthe name of, the record stockholder, fully and correctly, as the stockholder\u2019s name appears on the stockholder\u2019s stock\ncertificate(s) or in the transfer agent\u2019s records, in the case of uncertificated shares. The demand cannot be made\ndirectly by the beneficial owner if he or she does not also hold the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of\nrecord. The beneficial holder must, in such cases, have the registered owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other\nnominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of Common Stock. If you hold your shares of the\nCompany\u2019s Common Stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal\nrights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or the other nominee to determine the appropriate\nprocedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee.\nIf shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,\nguardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity. If the shares of Common\nStock or Preferred Stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,\nthe demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two\nor more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record\u037e however, the agent must\nidentify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting\nas agent for the record owner. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds shares of\nCommon Stock as a nominee for others, may exercise his or her right of appraisal with respect to the shares of\nCommon Stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In\nthat case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Common Stock as to which appraisal is sought.\nWhere no number of shares of Common Stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all\nshares of Common Stock held in the name of the record owner.\nWithin ten days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give notice of the date that the Merger has\nbecome effective to each of the Company\u2019s stockholders who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and\nwho did not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw\nthe demand and accept the cash payment specified by the Merger Agreement for that stockholder\u2019s shares of the\nCompany\u2019s Common Stock or Preferred Stock by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the\ndemand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective\nTime will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. Unless the demand is properly withdrawn by the\nstockholder within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of\nChancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, with such\napproval conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a\nrequest to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does\nnot approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised\nvalue determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the\nconsideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, either the Surviving Corporation or any stockholder who\nhas complied with the requirements of Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may\ncommence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination\nof the value of the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. Upon\nthe filing of the petition by a stockholder, service of a copy of such petition will be made upon the Surviving\nCorporation. The Surviving Corporation has no obligation to file such a petition, and holders should not assume that\nthe Surviving Corporation will file a petition. Accordingly, the failure of a stockholder to file such a petition within the\nperiod specified could nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal. In addition, within 120 days\nafter the Effective Time, any stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote\nin favor of the Merger Agreement, upon written request, will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation a\nstatement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock not voted in favor of\nthe Merger Agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate\nnumber of holders of such shares. The statement must be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such written\nrequest has been received by the Surviving Corporation. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of the\nCompany\u2019s Common Stock or Preferred Stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person\nmay, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation such\nstatement.\n80\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving\nCorporation, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the\npetition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all\nstockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock have not been reached. After notice to\nstockholders who have demanded appraisal, if such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition and to determine those\nstockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights provided by\nSection 262. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their\nshares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation\nof the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill dismiss the proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total\nnumber of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock (on an as-converted to Common Stock basis) or (2) the value of the consideration\nprovided in the Merger for such total number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock exceeds $1,000,000.\nAfter determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and\nPreferred Stock, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock,\ndetermining their fair value as of the Effective Time after taking into account all relevant factors exclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be\npaid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill direct the payment of such value together with interest, if any, upon surrender by those stockholders of the\ncertificates representing their shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock and, in the case of holders of\nuncertificated stock, forthwith. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded\nquarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from\ntime to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time\nbefore the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1)\nthe difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.\nYou should be aware that investment banking opinions as to fairness from a financial point of view is not necessarily\nan opinion as to fair value under Section 262. Although we believe that the Merger Consideration is fair, no\nrepresentation is made as to the outcome of an appraisal of fair value by the Delaware Court of Chancery and\nstockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower\nthan, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, we reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Common Stock is less than the Common\nStock Merger Consideration. In determining \u201cfair value,\u201d the Delaware Court is required to take into account all\nrelevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be\nconsidered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or\nmethods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the\nvalue of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value the court\nmust consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other\nfacts which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the\nmerged corporation.\nSection 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such\nexclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only\nto the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware\nSupreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d\n81\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCosts of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and imposed upon the Surviving Corporation and the stockholders\nparticipating in the appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery, as it deems equitable in the\ncircumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of\nthe expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts used in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro\nrata against the value of all shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock entitled to appraisal. Any stockholder who\ndemanded appraisal rights will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote shares of Common Stock or Preferred\nStock subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any other distribution with\nrespect to those shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, other than with respect to distributions payable to\nstockholders as of a record date prior to the Effective Time. However, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120\ndays after the Effective Time, or if the stockholder otherwise fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such\nholder\u2019s right to appraisal, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease and that stockholder will be\nentitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in cash, without interest thereon, less any applicable\nwithholding taxes, for his, her or its shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nIn view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, the Company\u2019s stockholders who may wish to pursue\nappraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors.\n82\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF COMMON STOCK",

Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the\nstockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s\nshares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A\nstockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided.\nWithin 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting\ncorporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this\nsubsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the\nmerger or consolidation has become effective\u037e or\n(2)\nIf the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \u00a7 228, \u00a7 251(h), \u00a7 253, or \u00a7 267 of this title, then\neither a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or\nresulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of\nstock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or\nconsolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of\nsuch constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the\nconstituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if\ngiven on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of\nthe effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20\ndays after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this\ntitle, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days\nafter the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the\nappraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by\nelectronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for\nthat purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the\nidentity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such\nholder\u2019s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective\ndate of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such\nconstituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such\nholders on or within 10 days after such effective date\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is sent\nmore than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to\n\u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this\ntitle and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each\nstockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares in\naccordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent\nof the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the\nabsence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the\nstockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record\ndate that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is\ngiven on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective\ndate. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the\nclose of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(e)\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or\nany stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise\nentitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery\ndemanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at\nany time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw\nsuch stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with\nthe requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic\ntransmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the\nnotice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the\nconsolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or\nconsolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of\nshares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in \u00a7 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were\nnot tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and, in either\ncase, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of\nsuch shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request\nfor such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the\nperiod for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.\nNotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock\nheld either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a\npetition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f)\nUpon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the\nsurviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register\nin Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all\nstockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their\nshares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in\nChancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition\nby registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list\nat the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before\nthe day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or\nsuch publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be\napproved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.\n(g)\nAt the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section\nand who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded\nan appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock\nto the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any\nstockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.\nIf immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent\ncorporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court\nshall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights\nunless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or\nseries eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such\ntotal number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h)\nAfter the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing\nappraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive\nof any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together\nwith interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value,\nthe Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for\ngood cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period\nbetween the\nB-3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\neffective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment\nin the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in\ncash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if\nany, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest\ntheretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by\nany stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to\ntrial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any\nstockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to\nsubsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in\nChancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such\nstockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i)\nThe Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving\nor resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder,\nin the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by\ncertificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court\u2019s decree\nmay be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or\nresulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.\n(j)\nThe costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems\nequitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the\nexpenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all\nthe shares entitled to an appraisal.\n(k)\nFrom and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal\nrights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to\nreceive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions\npayable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation)\u037e\nprovided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of\nthis section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60\ndays after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or\nthereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall\ncease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to\nany stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as\nthe Court deems just\u037e provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who\nhas not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60\ndays after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.\n(l)\nThe shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would\nhave been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and\nunissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

We have assumed that the executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from those reviewed\nby CF&CO.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we have not performed or obtained any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities\n(contingent or otherwise) of Kadmon, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals. During the course of our\nengagement, we were asked by the Board of Directors to solicit indications of interest from various third parties\nregarding a transaction with Kadmon, and we have considered the results of such solicitation in rendering our\nopinion. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner and in accordance with the terms\nof the Agreement without any limitations, restrictions, conditions, amendments or modifications, regulatory or\notherwise, that would be material in any respect to our analysis or our opinion. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or\naccounting experts and have relied on the assessments made by Kadmon and its advisors with respect to such\nissues. Our opinion does not address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters.\nWe do not express any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of Kadmon Common Stock may\ntrade subsequent to the announcement of the Merger.\nWe have acted as a financial advisor to Kadmon in connection with the Merger and will receive a customary fee for\nsuch services, a substantial portion of which is contingent on successful consummation of the Merger. A portion of\nour compensation is payable upon delivery of this letter and may be credited against the fee payable upon\nconsummation of the Merger. In addition, Kadmon has agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses and to indemnify\nus against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.\nCF&CO has previously been engaged (and may currently be engaged) by Kadmon to provide certain investment\nbanking and other services on matters unrelated to the Merger, for which we have received (or expect to receive)\ncustomary fees. CF&CO may seek to provide Kadmon and Sanofi and their respective affiliates with certain\ninvestment banking and other services unrelated to the Merger in the future.\nConsistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, CF&CO has adopted certain policies and procedures to\nestablish and maintain the independence of CF&CO\u2019s research departments and personnel. As a result, CF&CO\u2019s\nresearch analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports\nwith respect to Kadmon, Sanofi, the Merger and other participants in the Merger that differ from the views of\nCF&CO\u2019s investment banking personnel.\nIn the ordinary course of business, CF&CO and its affiliates may actively trade (for their own accounts and for the\naccounts of their customers) certain equity and debt securities, bank debt and/or other financial instruments issued\nby Kadmon and/or Sanofi and their respective affiliates, as well as derivatives thereof, and, accordingly, may at any\ntime hold long or short positions in such securities, bank debt, financial instruments and derivatives.\nIt is understood that this letter is intended for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors of Kadmon (in its\ncapacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the Merger.

Our opinion does not address Kadmon\u2019s underlying\nbusiness decision to pursue the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business or\nfinancial strategies that might exist for Kadmon or the effects of any other Merger in which Kadmon might engage.\nOur opinion only addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Kadmon Common Stock\n(other than Sanofi and its affiliates) of the Consideration and does not address any other term, aspect or implication\nof the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger. In addition, we do not express any\nview or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or\nto be received by any of Kadmon\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with\nthe Merger relative to the Consideration or otherwise.\nC-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOur opinion has been authorized for issuance by the Fairness Opinion and Valuation Committee of CF&CO.
