To access\nthe virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/STOR2022SM. At the special meeting, holders of our\ncommon stock, par\n \n2Table of Contents\nvalue $0.01 per share (\u201ccommon stock\u201d), will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the merger (the \u201cmerger proposal\u201d), (2) a\nproposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that\nis based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the \u201cadvisory compensation proposal\u201d), and (3) a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special\nmeeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger proposal (the\n\u201cadjournment proposal\u201d).\nPursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting.\nRecord Date, Notice and Quorum\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on October 24, 2022, are entitled to receive\nnotice of and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to\ncast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the\nrecord date, there were 282,685,797 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.\nThe presence virtually via the special meeting website or by proxy of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to\nbe cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special\nmeeting. Virtual attendance at the special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the special meeting. Abstentions will be\ncounted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect\nthat the special meeting will be adjourned to a later date (subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement).\nRequired Vote\nCompletion of the merger requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding\nshares of our common stock entitled to vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting (the \u201cstockholder approval\u201d). Because the required vote\nfor the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you abstain\nfrom voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee\non how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the\nvotes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. For the purpose of each of these proposals,\nif you abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or\nother nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is\npresent).\nProxies and Revocation\nAny holder of record of our common stock entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its shares of common stock by returning\nthe enclosed proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or by attending the virtual special meeting\nand voting during the live webcast. If the shares of our common stock that you own are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee,\nyou should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other\nnominee.\n \n3\nTable of Contents\nAny proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by your delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy card, by authorizing your\nproxy by telephone or through the Internet at a later date than your previously authorized proxy, by your filing a written revocation of your proxy\nwith our Corporate Secretary or by your voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting alone will not be sufficient to\nrevoke a previously authorized proxy.\nThe Merger (page 33)",

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law (\u201cMGCL\u201d), because shares of our\ncommon stock were listed on the NYSE on the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting, our\nstockholders who object to the merger do not have any appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection\nwith the merger. In addition, holders of our common stock may not exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting\nstockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder\u2019s shares in connection with the merger because, as permitted by the MGCL, our charter\nprovides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise such rights unless our board of directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the board,\ndetermines that the rights apply. Our board of directors has made no such determination. However, our stockholders can vote against the merger\nproposal.\nLitigation Related to the Merger (page 68)",

            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers briefly address some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the proposed merger. These\nquestions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information\ncontained elsewhere in this proxy statement, as well as the additional documents to which it refers or which it incorporates by reference, including the\nmerger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A.\n \nQ:\nWhat is the proposed transaction?\n \nA:\nThe proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company and its subsidiaries by affiliates of the Sponsors pursuant to the merger agreement.\nOnce we have obtained the stockholder approval and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, at\nthe merger effective time, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the Surviving Entity. For additional\ninformation about the merger, please review the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference into\nthis proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document governing the\nmerger.\n \nQ:\nAs a holder of common stock, what will I receive in the merger?\n \nA:\nFor each outstanding share of common stock that you own immediately prior to the merger effective time, you will receive $32.25 in cash, without\ninterest.\n \nQ:\nWill I receive any regular quarterly dividends with respect to the common stock that I own?\n \nA:\nOn September 19, 2022, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share of common stock for the quarter ended September 30, 2022,\nwhich was paid on October 17, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 30, 2022. Under the terms of the merger\nagreement, we may not declare, set aside or pay any other dividends or distributions to the holders of our common stock during the term of the\nmerger agreement, other than dividends or distributions required for us to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the incurrence\nof any income or excise taxes (which will result in a reduction of the merger consideration as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Treatment of Common Stock, Restricted Stock and Performance Units\u2014Common Stock\u201d).\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen to my shares of restricted stock and performance units?\n \nA:\nRestricted Stock. Effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding award of restricted stock granted pursuant to the Equity\nIncentive Plan will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and repurchase rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of our\ncommon stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will have the right to receive an\namount in cash equal to the merger consideration, less required withholding taxes.\nPerformance Units. Effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, outstanding awards of performance units granted pursuant to the\nEquity Incentive Plan will automatically become earned and vested, as further described below under the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests\nof Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d and \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits,\u201d and thereafter will be cancelled\nand, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled vested performance units will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the\nright to receive as of the merger effective time, in consideration for the cancellation of such vested performance unit and in settlement therefor, an\namount in cash equal to the product of (1) the merger consideration and (2) the number of so-determined earned performance shares subject to\nsuch vested performance units, without interest, less required withholding taxes. In addition, on the closing date, we will pay each holder of\nperformance units an amount equivalent to all cash dividends that would have been paid on the number of so-determined earned shares of\n \n15Table of Contents\nour common stock subject to such performance units as if they had been issued and outstanding from the date of grant up to, and including, the\nmerger effective time, less required withholding taxes.\n \nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\n \nA:\nIf we have obtained the stockholder approval, and assuming that the other conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, it is anticipated that the\nmerger will be completed in the first quarter of 2023. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the closing of the merger will take place as soon as\npracticable (and, in any event, within three business days) after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger described under the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to the Merger\u201d (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the\nclosing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing) or on such other date as agreed in writing by us\nand Parent\u037e provided, that, unless Parent otherwise agrees in writing, the consummation of the Merger will not occur prior to February 1, 2023.\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\n \nA:\nIf the merger proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive\nany payment for their shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, we will remain a public company and our common stock\nwill continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. Upon a termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, we will be required to\npay Parent the Company termination fee. Upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to\npay us the Parent termination fee.\n \nQ:\nIf the merger is completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares?\n \nA:\nFollowing the completion of the merger, your shares of common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your portion of the\nmerger consideration. In accordance with, and as required by the exchange agent\u2019s customary procedures, you may receive an instruction request\nletter, including instructions for effecting the exchange of your shares for the merger consideration.\n \nQ:\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\n \nA:\nThe special meeting will be held on December 9, 2022 at 8:00 a.m., Arizona time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special\nmeeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/STOR2022SM.\n \nQ:\nWho can vote and attend the special meeting?\n \nA:\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on October 24, 2022, are entitled to receive notice\nof and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast\none vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the\nrecord date, there were 282,685,797 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.\n \nQ:\nHow do I attend the virtual special meeting?\n \nA:\nThe special meeting will be held in a virtual-only format on December 9, 2022 at 8:00 a.m., Arizona time. You will not be able to physically attend the\nspecial meeting. To access the virtual meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/STOR2022SM. The special meeting\nwill start promptly at 8:00 a.m., Arizona time, and online access will begin at 7:45 a.m., Arizona time. To log in to the virtual meeting, you will be\nrequired to enter a control number, included on your proxy card, voting instruction\n \n16\nTable of Contents\nform or other notice that you may receive, which will allow you to participate in the virtual meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are\na stockholder as of the record date.\n \nQ:\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve the merger proposal?\n \nA:\nApproval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to\nvote on the merger proposal at the special meeting. Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our\nstockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares\nor vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will\nhave the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\n \nQ:\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve the advisory compensation proposal?\n \nA:\nApproval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of\nthis proposal, if you abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your\nbroker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of proposal (assuming a\nquorum is present).\n \nQ:\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve the adjournment proposal?\n \nA:\nApproval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this\nproposal, if you abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your\nbroker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal (assuming a\nquorum is present).\n \nQ:\nWhy is my vote important?\n \nA:\nIf you do not authorize your proxy or vote at the virtual special meeting, or do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it\nwill be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the special meeting. In addition, because the merger must be approved by the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the merger proposal, if you abstain\nfrom voting or fail to authorize your proxy or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to\nvote, such abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\n \nQ:\nHow does the merger consideration compare to the market price of our common stock?\n \nA:\nOur common stock has been listed on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cSTOR\u201d since November 18, 2014. The merger consideration of $32.25 per share\nrepresents a premium of approximately 20.4% over the closing price of our common stock of $26.79 on September 14, 2022, the last trading day prior\nto the public announcement of the merger agreement, and a premium of approximately 17.8% over the 90-day volume weighted average stock price\nthrough that date. Over the 12-month period ended September 14, 2022, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger\nagreement, the closing price of our common stock ranged from a low of $24.79 to a high of $35.11. You are encouraged to obtain current market\nquotations for our common stock.\n \nQ:\nHow does our board of directors recommend that I vote?\n \nA:\nOur board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the\nadjournment proposal.\n \n17\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related compensation payable to our\nnamed executive officers?\n \nA:\nIn July 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to\napprove certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to\ncorporate transactions such as the merger.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory compensation proposal?\n \nA:\nThe vote to approve the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Approval of\nthis proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our\nboard of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.\nAccordingly, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the advisory compensation proposal, if the merger is completed, our named executive\nofficers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.\n \nQ:\nDo any of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have any interest in the merger that is different than mine?\n \nA:\nOur directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders\ngenerally. See the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d and \u201c\u2014Quantification of\nPotential Payments and Benefits\u201d for information about interests that our directors and executive officers have in the merger that are different than\nyours.\n \nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\n \nA:\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, including the exhibits attached to this proxy statement,\nplease vote your shares of common stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. Holders of our common stock will be entitled to\none vote for each share of common stock owned as of the record date.\n \nQ:\nHow do I cast my vote?\n \nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote at the virtual special meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your shares at the\nvirtual special meeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying\npre-addressed, postage-paid envelope, or, if you prefer, by following the instructions on your proxy card for telephonic or Internet proxy\nauthorization. If the telephone or Internet option is available to you, we strongly encourage you to use it because it is faster and less costly.\nRegistered stockholders can transmit their voting instructions by telephone by calling (800) 690-6903 or on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com.\nTelephone and Internet voting are available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, the day immediately prior to the special meeting. Have\nyour proxy card with you if you are going to authorize your proxy by telephone or through the Internet. To authorize your proxy by mail, please\ncomplete sign, date and mail your proxy card in the envelope provided.\n \nQ:\nHow do I cast my vote if my shares of common stock are held of record in \u201cstreet name\u201d?\n \nA:\nIf you own shares of our common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you must provide voting instructions in\naccordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, since brokers, banks and\nother nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement. If you\n \n18\nTable of Contents\nhave not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other\nnominee who can give you directions on how to vote your common stock. If you hold your common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee\nand wish to vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a \u201clegal proxy,\u201d executed in your favor, from the broker, bank or other nominee\n(which may take several days).\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?\n \nA:\nWith respect to the merger proposal, if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of\na quorum, but such abstention will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. With respect to the advisory compensation\nproposal and the adjournment proposal, if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the\npresence of a quorum, but abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals.\nWith respect to the merger proposal, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your\nbroker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining\nwhether a quorum is present at the special meeting and such failure to vote will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nWith respect to the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at\nthe virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d your shares will\nnot be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, but such failure to vote will not have any effect on\nthe outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is present).\n \nQ:\nHow will proxy holders vote my shares of common stock?\n \nA:\nIf you properly authorize a proxy prior to the virtual special meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct. If you authorize a\nproxy but no direction is otherwise made, your shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal. Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the\nvirtual special meeting.\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my common stock before the special meeting?\n \nA:\nIf you held common stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective time, you will retain your right to vote at the special\nmeeting, but not the right to receive the merger consideration for such shares. The right to receive the merger consideration when the merger\nbecomes effective will pass to the person who owns the shares you previously owned.\n \nQ:\nCan I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?\n \nA:\nYes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it is\nexercised by filing with our Corporate Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending and voting at\nthe virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you\nhave instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the foregoing options for changing your vote do not apply and instead you\nmust follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.\n \nQ:\nIs the merger expected to be taxable to me?\n \nA:\nYes. The receipt of the merger consideration for each share of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\n \n19\nTable of Contents\nyou will recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger measured by the difference, if any, between the merger consideration you receive and your\nadjusted tax basis in your common stock. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may be required to withhold a portion of your merger\nconsideration under applicable tax laws, including, in the case of non-U.S. holders, pursuant to FIRPTA. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the\nmerger. Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. We encourage\nyou to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the merger to you.\n \nQ:\nWhat rights do I have if I oppose the merger?\n \nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the merger proposal. You are not, however, entitled to appraisal rights,\ndissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger under Maryland law because shares of our common stock\nwere listed on the NYSE on the record date. In addition, stockholders may not exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an\nobjecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder\u2019s shares in connection with the merger because, as permitted by the MGCL, our\ncharter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise any such rights unless our board of directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the directors, determines that the rights apply. Our board of directors has made no such determination. See the section entitled \u201cNo Dissenters\u2019\nRights of Appraisal.\u201d\n \nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\n \nA:\nWe intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed\nwith the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov when\nfiled.\n \nQ:\nCan I participate if I am unable to attend the virtual special meeting?\n \nA:\nIf you are unable to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your\nproxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet.\n \nQ:\nHave any stockholders already agreed to approve the merger?\n \nA:\nNo. There are no other agreements between Parent, Merger Sub or other affiliates of the Sponsors, on the one hand, and any of our stockholders,\non the other hand, in which a stockholder has agreed to vote in favor of the approval of the merger proposal.\n \nQ:\nWhere can I find more information about the Company?\n \nA:\nWe file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.storecapital.com. The\ninformation found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this proxy statement or\nany other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC. You can also request copies of these documents from us. See the section entitled\n\u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\n \nQ:\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\n \nA:\nWe will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview,\ntelephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other employees, for which they will not receive additional compensation.\nWe have engaged Alliance Advisors, LLC (\u201cAlliance Advisors\u201d) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately\n \n20\nTable of Contents\n$25,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and we have agreed to indemnify Alliance Advisors against certain losses,\ncosts and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations holding shares in their names, or in the names of their nominees, that are\nbeneficially owned by others to send or cause to be sent proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners and will reimburse\nsuch holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing.\n \nQ:\nWho can help answer my other questions?\n \nA:\nIf after reading this proxy statement you have more questions about the special meeting or the merger, you should contact us at:\nSTORE Capital Corporation\n8377 East Hartford Drive, Suite 100\nScottsdale, Arizona 85255\nAttention: Chad A.

For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you\nabstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other\nnominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is present).\nAccordingly, in order for your shares to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must either return the enclosed proxy card, authorize your\nproxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet or vote at the virtual special meeting.\nVotes cast by proxy or at the virtual special meeting will be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of election for the special\nmeeting. The inspector of election will also determine the number of shares of common stock represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy.\nHow to Authorize a Proxy",

Accordingly, if you own shares of our common stock through a broker, bank or other\nnominee (i.e., in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker,\nbank or other nominee provides to you, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three\nproposals described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of our common stock\nfollowing the directions contained in such voting instruction card. If you have not received such voting instructions or require further information\nregarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares of our common\nstock. If you hold shares of our common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and wish to vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a\n\u201clegal proxy,\u201d executed in your favor, from the broker, bank or other nominee (which may take several days). Because approval of the merger proposal\nrequires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes of our common stock entitled to be cast on the\nmerger proposal, and because your broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on the proposal, the failure to provide\nyour broker, bank or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. Because the approval\nof the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal,\nand because your broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your broker, bank\nor other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on the outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is present).\n \n30Table of Contents\nProxies and Revocation",

The following chronology\ndoes not purport to catalogue every conversation among our board of directors, the transaction committee, members of our management or our\nrepresentatives and other parties.\nOur board of directors and senior management regularly review our strategies, performance and objectives in light of the current business,\neconomic and capital markets environments, as well as trends and developments in the net-lease REIT sector and real estate industry more generally. As\npart of these reviews, our board of directors and senior management have periodically considered various potential strategic and financial initiatives, all\nwith the goal of maximizing stockholder value, and have recognized various opportunities and challenges that we face as a public company, including,\namong other things, management\u2019s ability to generate accretive acquisition opportunities and optimize returns on its existing portfolio against the current\nmarket backdrop.\nOn April 5, 2022, while attending an investor conference in New York, New York, Mary B. Fedewa, our President and Chief Executive Officer and a\nmember of our board of directors, and other members of our senior management, met with investors throughout the day, including representatives of GIC,\nwhich has been a stockholder of the Company over the past five years and, as of the date hereof, holds approximately 0.6% of the outstanding shares of\nour common stock. During the meeting with GIC, the members of our senior management discussed publicly available information, including our results of\noperations and general business, investment and financing strategies. Following the meeting, representatives of GIC requested that the parties meet\nagain over the following days to continue the discussion. In advance of the meeting, GIC executed a limited non-disclosure agreement in which it agreed\nto keep non-public information discussed at the meeting, if any, confidential.\nOn April 7, 2022, members of our senior management and representatives of GIC met for lunch and continued to discuss the net-lease real estate\nsector and market conditions generally. No specific transactions or terms were discussed at the lunch meeting. Later that week, a representative of GIC\ncalled Ms. Fedewa and requested an in-person meeting to learn more about our business, investment and financing strategies. In advance of the next\nmeeting, GIC executed a second limited non-disclosure agreement in which it agreed to keep non-public information, discussed at the meeting, if any,\nconfidential.\nOn April 13, 2022, representatives of GIC attended in-person investor presentations conducted by members of our senior management at our\ncorporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona. During the presentations, the members of our senior management and representatives of GIC engaged in a\ndiscussion of our business, investment and financing strategies. Following the meeting, representatives of GIC expressed a general interest in a potential\nbusiness opportunity with us and requested that we provide GIC with non-public information to facilitate GIC\u2019s review of the Company. No specific\ntransaction terms were discussed.\nOn April 19, 2022, members of our senior management and a representative of DLA Piper, our outside legal counsel, had a call with Tawn Kelley, the\nchairman of our board of directors, to provide an update on the recent meetings with GIC and discuss GIC\u2019s request for non-public information.\nSubsequently, on April 19, 2022, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with GIC (which agreement contained customary standstill restrictions,\nwhich restrictions terminate in the event we enter into a definitive agreement with a third party to effect a sale of the Company), following which we\nprovided GIC with limited, non-public property-level operating and financial information. Over the next several weeks, GIC conducted a due diligence\nreview of the Company and engaged in high-level discussions with Ms. Fedewa and other members of our senior management regarding the due\ndiligence information.\n \n33Table of Contents\nAfter the close of business on May 27, 2022, a representative of GIC telephoned Ms. Fedewa and informed her that, based on their due diligence\nreview, GIC would be interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of the Company. The representative of GIC did not discuss specific terms or propose a\nprice or other valuation of the Company. Ms. Fedewa relayed this conversation to Ms. Kelley.\nOn May 31, 2022, Ms. Fedewa received a letter, dated May 27, 2022, from GIC (the \u201cMay 31 letter\u201d and the proposal set forth therein, the \u201cMay 31\nproposal\u201d). The May 31 letter stated that GIC had followed us for several years in its capacity as a holder of our common stock and was impressed by the\nperformance of the portfolio and our long-term track record of growth. In the May 31 letter, GIC proposed to acquire the Company in an all-cash\ntransaction at a price of $32.00 per share, which represented a premium of 20% over the closing price of our common stock of $26.74 on May 26, 2022. The\nMay 31 letter also stated that (1) GIC was prepared to conduct all due diligence and concurrently negotiate a definitive merger agreement over a period of\n45 days and would be willing to discuss the inclusion of a customary \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in the agreement, (2) the transaction would be funded with a\ncombination of equity financing of approximately $6.0 billion and debt financing of approximately $8.3 billion (including assumable debt currently on our\nbalance sheet and new debt financing) and would not be subject to any financing condition and (3) the transaction would be subject only to customary\nclosing conditions for the acquisition of a public REIT. The May 31 letter also stated that GIC would welcome the opportunity, at the appropriate time, to\nspeak with the Company about go-forward management arrangements, including with respect to preserving the Company\u2019s operating structure while\nproviding the funding necessary to enable the Company to continue to grow its portfolio and accelerate its real estate acquisition plans. The May 31\nletter did not outline any other terms of the proposal. The May 31 letter was circulated to our board of directors, as well as our legal advisors. On the prior\ntrading day, May 27, 2022, the closing price of our common stock was $27.29 per share.\nLater on May 31, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of\nDLA Piper, to discuss the terms and conditions of the May 31 proposal. In reviewing the May 31 proposal, our board of directors noted that, while the\nproposal represented a credible offer from a substantial and well-capitalized firm, our board of directors would need to begin a strategic review process\nand engage one or more financial advisors to evaluate the financial aspects of the May 31 proposal and provide information regarding other\nopportunities available to us that could potentially enhance stockholder value, including, among others, continuing to execute our long-term business\nstrategies as a standalone public company, pursuing other strategic or financial initiatives or engaging in a process to explore interest in a sale of the\nCompany (with both strategic and financial buyers). After discussion, our board of directors determined that it should further review and discuss the\nMay 31 proposal, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, at a future meeting.\nIn addition, at the meeting on May 31, 2022, our board of directors established an ad hoc advisory transaction committee (the \u201ctransaction\ncommittee\u201d) to assist our board of directors in considering the May 31 proposal. Tawn Kelley, Catherine D. Rice, Jawad Ahsan and David M. Edwards, all\nof whom are non-employee, independent directors were appointed to the transaction committee. Throughout the evaluation and negotiation process over\nthe next few months, the members of the transaction committee conducted several formal meetings. In addition, the members of the transaction committee,\nas well as our board of directors, periodically met in executive session with only the independent directors and outside legal counsel present. In light of\nour receipt of the May 31 proposal, our board of directors determined it would be advisable for the Company to retain financial advisors to assist the\nboard and authorized the transaction committee to select and retain such financial advisors.\nLater on May 31, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of\nDLA Piper, to continue to discuss the terms and conditions of the May 31 proposal, the board\u2019s strategic review process and potential financial advisors,\nincluding Evercore, Goldman Sachs and other candidates. The transaction committee also discussed, with the assistance of our senior management and\nin consultation with our legal advisors, the process to engage financial advisors and the range of advisory fees typically payable in connection with the\nsale of a public company. Based on this discussion and our\n \n34\nTable of Contents\nextensive experience with numerous investment banking firms, the transaction committee determined that it would be advisable to engage two financial\nadvisors and authorized Ms. Fedewa to contact representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs regarding their candidacy to serve as our financial\nadvisors. The transaction committee noted that Evercore\u2019s and Goldman Sachs\u2019 respective engagements and other relationships with each of the\nCompany and GIC would need to be reviewed to determine whether there were any conflicts that would interfere with their ability to serve as independent\nfinancial advisors. The transaction committee considered Evercore as a potential candidate to assist and advise our board of directors because of\nEvercore\u2019s qualifications, experience and reputation, relationship with the Company, substantial knowledge of the REIT sector and its involvement in\nrecent strategic transactions in the net-lease REIT sector. The transaction committee considered Goldman Sachs as a potential candidate to assist and\nadvise our board of directors because of Goldman Sachs\u2019 qualifications, experience and reputation, long-standing relationship with the Company,\nknowledge of the net-lease REIT sector and its involvement in recent acquisition transactions in the public REIT industry. At the conclusion of the\nmeeting, the members of the transaction committee met in executive session with the representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss the transaction\ncommittee\u2019s role and responsibilities and the board\u2019s strategic review process.\nOn June 3, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of DLA\nPiper, to discuss the Company\u2019s existing five-year strategic plan (the \u201cfive-year plan\u201d). The transaction committee, with the assistance of our senior\nmanagement and in consultation with our legal advisors, reviewed and discussed the five-year plan, which included the financial projections (as defined\nbelow under the section entitled \u201c\u2014Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d) regarding our future operations for fiscal years ending December 31,\n2022 through December 31, 2026. Our senior management reviewed with the transaction committee the assumptions underlying the financial projections,\nincluding estimates of future capital costs, capitalization rates and interest rates, and highlighted certain challenges we could face as a standalone public\ncompany, including the deteriorating credit markets and rising interest rate environment, in the context of evaluating and achieving the financial\nprojections. Following discussion and questions of senior management about the financial projections, the transaction committee confirmed that the\nfinancial projections provided an appropriate framework to evaluate the May 31 proposal. Also at the meeting, Ms. Fedewa provided an update on her\nrecent discussions with representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs and discussed the expected roles and responsibilities of each firm. After\ndiscussion, the transaction committee authorized our senior management to negotiate engagement letters with Evercore and Goldman Sachs and to\nprovide them the financial projections for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses. At the conclusion of the meeting,\nthe members of the transaction committee met in executive session with the representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss the role of the transaction\ncommittee and other topics related to the board\u2019s strategic review process.\nLater on June 3, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of\nEvercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper. The representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs were introduced and described their respective experience\nand qualifications to serve as financial advisors. The representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs also provided an outline of potential next steps in\nthe board\u2019s strategic review process and various factors to consider in connection with the board\u2019s evaluation of the May 31 proposal, the five-year plan\nand other strategic and financial initiatives available to the Company. Our board of directors, with the assistance of our senior management and in\nconsultation with the representatives of Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, discussed, among other matters, (1) the current economic environment\nand certain challenges facing the net-lease real estate sector generally and the Company in particular, (2) the five-year plan, including the financial\nprojections and their underlying assumptions, (3) GIC\u2019s businesses, transaction history and capital sources, and (4) the potential next steps in the\nstrategic review process. Our board of directors confirmed that Evercore and Goldman Sachs should prepare a presentation regarding their preliminary\nfinancial analyses with respect to the Company and certain financial aspects of the May 31 proposal for the next meeting of our board of directors. At the\nconclusion of the meeting, the independent directors met in executive session with representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss, among other matters,\nthe duties of our board of directors in connection with the evaluation of the May 31 proposal, the\n \n35\nTable of Contents\npresentations from Evercore and Goldman Sachs, the five-year plan (including the financial projections) and related matters.\nOn June 10, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of\nEvercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to discuss the May 31 proposal, the five-year plan and the board\u2019s strategic review process. Representatives of\nEvercore and Goldman Sachs discussed with the transaction committee their preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company and certain\nfinancial aspects of the May 31 proposal, as well as other strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company, including remaining a standalone\npublic company or initiating a formal process to contact potential buyers, including other publicly traded REITs and financial sponsors, regarding a sale\nof the Company. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs also reviewed certain financial risks to our long-term business strategies, including the\ndeteriorating credit markets and rising interest rate environment, and potential options for the Company to respond to the May 31 proposal. The\ntransaction committee continued to discuss, with the assistance of our senior management and in consultation with our financial and legal advisors, the\nadvantages and risks of a proposed transaction with GIC, including, among other things, whether the May 31 proposal represented an attractive\nvaluation for stockholders when considered in light of the five-year plan and the transaction committee\u2019s knowledge and understanding of our business,\noperations, management, financial condition and prospects and the various challenges we could continue to face as a standalone public company. At the\nconclusion of the meeting, the members of the transaction committee met in executive session with the representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss\nthe May 31 proposal and related matters. Following extensive discussion, the transaction committee resolved to recommend to our board of directors that\nwe engage with GIC regarding the May 31 proposal.\nAt GIC\u2019s request, on June 12, 2022, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of our board of directors, had a call with\nrepresentatives of GIC. During the call, representatives of GIC informed Evercore and Goldman Sachs that the 45-day due diligence and negotiation\nperiod referenced in the May 31 letter would not begin until the parties came to an agreement in principle on valuation, subject to the negotiation of the\ndefinitive merger agreement and other customary conditions.\nOn June 13, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of\nEvercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to discuss, among other matters, the five-year plan and the terms and conditions of the May 31 proposal.\nRepresentatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs reviewed with our board of directors their preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company,\ncertain financial aspects of the May 31 proposal, other strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company and potential options for the\nCompany to respond to the May 31 proposal. The members of our senior management and our board of directors discussed certain risks related to the\nexecution of our business plan, including the potential for an economic slowdown, the impact of rising borrowing costs, and the discount to estimated\nnet asset value at which our common stock has recently traded, all of which have the potential to adversely impact our ability to fund future acquisitions\nat an accretive cost of capital. Our board of directors also discussed, with the assistance of our senior management and in consultation with our financial\nand legal advisors, the best process for maximizing stockholder value if the Company were to be sold, including whether a competitive bidding process\nwould yield a higher price than GIC\u2019s proposal and the use of a customary \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision to facilitate competing bids after signing a definitive\nmerger agreement, as well as benefits and risks to our business posed by contacting other potential buyers before engaging with GIC, including the risk\nthat engaging with or contacting other potential buyers prior to signing a definitive merger agreement with GIC could jeopardize the availability of GIC\u2019s\nproposal. Our board of directors also discussed with our senior management and our financial and legal advisors other potential risks and considerations,\nincluding, among other concerns, that market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt our business and risk employee turnover,\nas well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price volatility, and that there were a limited number of potential buyers with the\nfinancial ability to acquire the Company (including as a result of rising interest rates and the deterioration in the credit markets). At the conclusion of the\nmeeting, our board of directors met in executive session with the representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss the\n \n36\nTable of Contents\nMay 31 proposal and a potential counteroffer. After further discussion of the preliminary financial analyses presented by representatives of Evercore and\nGoldman Sachs and the best path forward to maximize value for our stockholders, our board of directors determined to move forward with bilateral\nnegotiations with GIC and authorized the transaction committee to engage further with our financial advisors to develop and submit to GIC a counteroffer\nwith a price per share of at least $34.00 in cash.\nLater on June 13, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of\nEvercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to continue to discuss the May 31 proposal, as well as other strategic alternatives that might be available to the\nCompany, including remaining a standalone public company or initiating a formal sale process, and the benefits and risks related to each, including those\ndiscussed at prior meetings of the transaction committee and our board of directors. After further discussion of the best path forward to maximize value\nfor stockholders, the transaction committee determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to pursue a transaction with\nGIC with a price per share of at least $34.00 in cash, but that any definitive merger agreement with GIC must contain a customary \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision or\nother mechanism that would permit us to solicit and entertain potentially superior proposals from other bidders after executing a definite merger\nagreement with GIC. The transaction committee then instructed the representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs to submit a counteroffer to GIC with a\nprice per share of $34.00 in cash and to inform GIC that we would require that any definitive merger agreement include a customary \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision.\nOn the prior trading day, June 10, 2022, the closing price of our common stock was $26.39 per share.\nFollowing the transaction committee meeting, on June 14, 2022, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the\ntransaction committee (as authorized by our board of directors), contacted representatives of GIC to inform them of our counteroffer with a price per share\nof $34.00 in cash and a requirement that any definitive merger agreement between the parties include a customary \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision. GIC did not\nprovide a definitive response to our counteroffer at this time.\nThroughout the remainder of June and July 2022, we provided additional customary due diligence information to GIC and its advisors and made\nmembers of our senior management and advisors available to such parties to address their questions.\nOn June 17, 2022, representatives of GIC contacted representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs to inform them that GIC remained committed to\npursuing an acquisition of the Company, but, given the current state of the capital markets, that GIC would need additional time to develop a financing\npackage before formally responding to our counteroffer.\nLater on June 17, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and a representative\nof DLA Piper. The transaction committee discussed our financial advisors\u2019 recent discussions with GIC, including GIC\u2019s continuing commitment to pursue\nan acquisition of the Company and its need for additional time to develop a financing package.\nOn July 5, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of Evercore,\nGoldman Sachs and DLA Piper. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs provided an update on their recent discussions with GIC, including\nGIC\u2019s continuing efforts to coordinate a debt financing package, and noted that, due to continuing market volatility, GIC had not formally responded to\nour counterproposal. Our board of directors, with the assistance of our senior management and in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,\ndiscussed, among other matters, the 45-day due diligence and negotiation period proposed by GIC, the time sensitive nature of the potential transaction\nand the various possible outcomes of the negotiations with GIC. At the conclusion of the meeting, our board of directors met in executive session with\nthe representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss the potential transaction and related matters.\nOn July 19, 2022, acting at the direction of our board of directors, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs had a meeting with\nrepresentatives of GIC and its advisors. During the meeting, the representatives of GIC\n \n37\nTable of Contents\ninformed Evercore and Goldman Sachs that GIC would like to bring in an equity partner to the potential transaction. Subsequently on July 20, 2022, at the\nrequest of GIC, the Company and GIC entered into a confidentiality agreement with Oak Street, as a potential equity partner and co-bidder with GIC,\nfollowing which we provided Oak Street with access to the virtual data room containing our due diligence materials. Over the next few weeks, Oak Street\nengaged in a due diligence review of the Company, including property-level information. In addition, on July 26, 2022, at the request of GIC, the Company\nand GIC entered into a confidentiality agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (\u201cCredit Suisse\u201d) (an affiliate of Column Financial, Inc.), as a\npotential source of debt financing to GIC and Oak Street, following which Credit Suisse engaged in a due diligence review of the Company, including\nproperty-level information.\nOn July 26, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of DLA\nPiper, to further discuss the formal engagement of Evercore and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors. The transaction committee reviewed the customary\nwritten relationships disclosure related to the Company and GIC provided by each of Evercore and Goldman Sachs and distributed to the transaction\ncommittee prior to the meeting. After discussion, including with the representatives of DLA Piper, the transaction committee determined that those\nrelationships would not interfere with either firm\u2019s ability to serve as a financial advisor to the Company. The representatives of DLA Piper then reviewed\nwith the transaction committee the material terms of the proposed engagement letters with each of Evercore and Goldman Sachs. Following this\ndiscussion, the transaction committee determined to formally engage Evercore and Goldman Sachs as our financial advisors and approved their\nrespective engagement letters. As authorized by the transaction committee, on July 27, 2022, we executed engagement letters with each of Evercore and\nGoldman Sachs.\nOn July 28, 2022, a representative of GIC delivered to Ms. Fedewa separate non-binding proposal letters, dated as of July 28, 2022, from each of GIC\nand Oak Street (together, the \u201cJuly 28 letters\u201d and the proposal set forth therein, the \u201cJuly 28 proposal\u201d). In the July 28 letters, GIC and Oak Street\nproposed to acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction at a price of $32.00 per share, which represented a premium of 14% over the closing price of\nour common stock of $28.07 on July 27, 2022. While the July 28 letters reflected the same offer price per share as the May 31 proposal, due to the\ncontinuing deterioration in the credit markets and rising interest rate environment, the offer set forth in the July 28 letters contained a substantially higher\nequity commitment from GIC and Oak Street. In this regard, the July 28 letters stated that (1) GIC and Oak Street were prepared to conduct all due\ndiligence and concurrently negotiate a definitive merger agreement over a period of no more than 45 days and (2) the transaction would be funded with a\ncombination of equity financing of approximately $8.3 billion (reflecting an increase of approximately $2.3 billion in the overall equity commitment, as\ncompared to the equity commitment stated in the May 31 letter) and debt financing of approximately $5.9 billion (comprised of approximately $3.7 billion\nof assumable debt currently on our balance sheet and approximately $2.2 billion of new debt financing currently under negotiation, reflecting a decrease\nof approximately $2.3 billion in the overall amount of expected debt financing, as compared to the debt financing contemplated in the May 31 letter) and\nwould not be subject to any financing contingency. In addition, the July 28 letter from GIC noted GIC would be willing to discuss the inclusion of a\ncustomary \u201cgo-shop\u201d in the definitive merger agreement. The July 28 letters did not outline any other terms of the offer. The July 28 letters were circulated\nto our board of directors, as well as our financial and legal advisors.\nOn July 29, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of\nEvercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to discuss the terms and conditions of the July 28 proposal. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs\ndiscussed with the transaction committee their respective preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company and certain financial aspects of the\nJuly 28 proposal. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs also discussed, among other matters, (1) Oak Street\u2019s businesses, transaction history\nand capital sources, (2) the status of the due diligence process, and (3) the significant changes in economic conditions since GIC submitted the May 31\nproposal, including the continued deterioration of the credit markets, lack of available debt financing, rising interest rates and volatility in the capital\nmarkets. The transaction committee continued to discuss, with the\n \n38\nTable of Contents\nassistance of our senior management and in consultation with our financial and legal advisors, whether the July 28 proposal represented an attractive\nvaluation for stockholders when considered in the context of the five-year plan and the various challenges we could face as a standalone public\ncompany. Following extensive discussion, the transaction committee resolved to recommend to our board of directors that we submit another\ncounteroffer to GIC with a price per share of $33.00 in cash.\nOn July 31, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of Evercore,\nGoldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to discuss the terms and conditions of the July 28 proposal from GIC and Oak Street. Representatives of Evercore and\nGoldman Sachs discussed with our board of directors their respective preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company and certain financial\naspects of the July 28 proposal. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs also discussed, among other matters, Oak Street\u2019s businesses,\ntransaction history and capital sources and the significant changes in economic conditions since GIC submitted the May 31 proposal, including the\ncontinued deterioration of the credit markets, lack of available debt financing, rising interest rates and volatility in the capital markets. Our board of\ndirectors continued to discuss, with the assistance of our senior management and in consultation with our financial and legal advisors, whether the July\n28 proposal represented an attractive valuation for stockholders when considered in the context of the five-year plan and the various challenges we could\nface as a standalone public company. After further discussion of the best path forward to maximize value for stockholders, and consistent with the\nrecommendation of the transaction committee, our board of directors determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to\ncontinue to pursue a transaction with GIC and Oak Street at a price per share of at least $33.00 in cash. Our board of directors then instructed the\nrepresentatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs to submit a counteroffer to GIC and Oak Street at a price per share of $33.00 in cash.\nLater on July 31, 2022, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of our board of directors, contacted representatives\nof GIC to inform them of our counteroffer at a price per share of $33.00 in cash. In response to our counteroffer, on July 31, 2022, the representatives of\nGIC and Oak Street conveyed their \u201cbest and final\u201d offer with a price per share of $32.25 in cash (the \u201cfinal proposal\u201d) and confirmed that any definitive\nmerger agreement between the parties would include a customary \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision with a two-tier termination fee. GIC and Oak Street reaffirmed their\ncommitment to complete due diligence and negotiate a definitive merger agreement in 45 days and that there would be no financing contingency in the\nagreement. GIC and Oak Street did not outline any other terms of the final proposal.\nOn August 1, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of\nEvercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to discuss the final proposal. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs reviewed with our board of\ndirectors their respective preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company (as previously presented at the board meeting on the day before)\nand certain financial aspects of the final proposal. In consultation with its financial advisors, our board of directors determined that GIC and Oak Street\nwould not improve upon the final proposal and that asking for additional improvement in the purchase price would put the transaction at risk and delay\nthe commencement of the 45-day period to complete due diligence and negotiate the definitive merger agreement. Our board of directors discussed,\namong other things, whether the final proposal represented an attractive valuation of the Company when considered in light of the five-year plan and the\nboard\u2019s knowledge and understanding of our business, operations, management, financial condition and prospects. Based on the discussion at this\nmeeting and previous board and transaction committee meetings, our board of directors concluded that the final proposal from GIC and Oak Street would,\nif consummated, provide greater certainty of value (and less risk) to our stockholders relative to the potential trading price of our common stock after\naccounting for the various challenges we could continue to face as a standalone public company. After considering our strategic alternatives to a\npotential transaction with GIC and Oak Street, including continuing as a standalone public company, our board of directors authorized the representatives\nof Evercore and Goldman Sachs to confirm to GIC and Oak Street an agreement in principle at a price per share of $32.25 in cash, in accordance with the\nterms outlined in the final proposal, and instructed DLA Piper to begin negotiations of the definitive merger agreement and related documents.\n \n39\nTable of Contents\nSubsequently on August 1, 2022, as directed by our board of directors, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs confirmed to a\nrepresentative of GIC an agreement in principle at a price per share of $32.25 in cash and further confirmed that our board of directors was willing to move\nforward with negotiating and finalizing a definitive merger agreement in accordance with the terms outlined in the final proposal. The representatives of\nGIC agreed that this agreement in principle would commence the 45-day period to complete due diligence and negotiate the definitive merger agreement\nand related documents.\nFrom August 1, 2022 through the signing of the merger agreement on September 15, 2022, we continued to provide additional customary due\ndiligence information to GIC and Oak Street and their respective advisors, as well as Credit Suisse and its advisors, as their potential source of committed\ndebt financing, coordinated due diligence calls and made members of our senior management available to such parties to address their questions.\nOn August 3, 2022, DLA Piper provided an initial draft of the proposed merger agreement to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP\n(\u201cSkadden\u201d), legal advisors to GIC. The draft merger agreement contemplated, among other things, (1) a customary all-cash merger, (2) a customary 30-\nday \u201cgo-shop\u201d period with a two-tier termination fee equal to 1.5% of the equity value of the merger if we terminated the merger agreement within 40 days\nto accept a superior proposal received during the first 30 days after signing the merger agreement, and otherwise 3.0% of the equity value of the merger,\n(3) a reverse termination fee equal to 10.0% of the equity value of the merger and a right to specifically enforce the merger agreement (subject to certain\ncustomary terms and conditions), and (4) that we would be permitted to pay regular quarterly dividends to holders of our common stock in the ordinary\ncourse of business consistent with past practice during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger.\nOn August 19, 2022, Skadden provided initial comments from GIC and Oak Street on the draft merger agreement.

            "text": "Reasons for the Merger\nIn reaching its unanimous decision to determine and declare that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to recommend that our stockholders approve the merger, our board of directors consulted with\nmembers of our management, as well as our financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors\nwhich our board of directors viewed as supporting its unanimous decision:\n \n\u2022\nthe current and historical trading prices of our common stock, and the premium provided by the merger consideration of $32.25 per share\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger consideration is a fixed cash amount that provides our stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately\nupon the closing of the merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent or greater value\nfrom our long-term business plan\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that our common stock has consistently traded at a discounted multiple as compared to our net-lease industry peer companies\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe various risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company, including our need to frequently raise capital due to the\ncapital-intensive nature of our business, and the difficulty and increasing cost of obtaining capital in a high interest rate environment\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger consideration was the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger consideration reflects an increase over the initial offer and the right to pay the regular quarterly dividend for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2022, and also reflects the Sponsors\u2019 best and final offer\u037e\n \n\u2022\nour board of directors\u2019 belief that there exists few other potential third parties with both interest in the net-lease space and with the financial\nability to acquire us in light of the amount of cash required to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock and current capital\nmarkets uncertainties\u037e\n \n\u2022\nour board of directors\u2019 belief that contacting other potential bidders before announcing a transaction would result in significant risks to us\nand our business, including concerns that leaks or rumors regarding a potential transaction could disrupt our business, risk employee\nturnover and cause turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price volatility\u037e\n \n43Table of Contents\n\u2022\nour right to solicit potential third party purchasers prior to the no-shop period start date, to change, withhold, qualify or withdraw the\nrecommendation of our board of directors, and to terminate the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, in order to enter into a\ndefinitive agreement providing for the implementation of a superior proposal, upon payment of the Company termination fee\u037e\n \n\u2022\nadvice from our independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the two-tiered Company termination fee structure is\nreasonable under the circumstances and not likely to preclude any other interested party from making an acquisition proposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe probability that the merger will be completed based on, among other things, the Sponsors\u2019 substantial available capital and extensive\nexperience in the real estate industry, the absence of a financing contingency, the substantial Parent termination fee payable to us if the\nmerger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, and our right under the merger agreement to seek specific performance and require\nthe Sponsors to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under certain circumstances\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe oral opinion of Evercore, subsequently confirmed in Evercore\u2019s written opinion, dated September 14, 2022, to the effect that, as of the\ndate of such opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore\u2019s\nwritten opinion, the merger consideration of $32.25 per share of common stock to be received by holders of shares of our common stock\n(other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more\nfully described below in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Opinions of Our Financial Advisors\u2014Opinion of Evercore\u037e\u201d\n \n\u2022\nthe oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, dated September 15, 2022, to the effect that,\nas of the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs\u2019\nwritten opinion, the $32.25 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our\ncommon stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in\nthe section \u201c\u2014Opinions of Our Financial Advisors\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs\u037e\u201d and\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger is subject to our receipt of the stockholder approval, and that our stockholders are free to vote against the merger\nfor any reason, including if a higher offer were to be made prior to the special meeting (in certain cases subject to the payment of the\nCompany termination fee if we subsequently were to enter into a definitive agreement relating to, or to consummate, any acquisition\nproposal).\nOur board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its consideration of the merger agreement, the merger and the\nother transactions contemplated by the merger agreement:\n \n\u2022\nour inability, after the no-shop period start date, to solicit competing proposals and the possibility that the Company termination fee\npayable by us upon the termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential bidders from\nmaking an acquisition proposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that, following the merger, we will no longer exist as an independent public company and that our existing stockholders will not\nparticipate in any future earnings or growth\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe risk that an alternative transaction or different strategic alternative potentially could be more beneficial to our stockholders than the\nproposed merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking\nbusiness opportunities that may arise pending completion of the merger\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that, under the terms of the merger agreement, after the payment of the regular quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, we are not permitted to make, declare or pay any additional regular quarterly cash dividends or distributions.\n \n44\nTable of Contents\nThe foregoing discussion of the factors considered by our board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material\nfactors considered by our board of directors. In reaching its unanimous decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, our board of directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to, and did not make specific assessments\nof, the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. Our board of directors did not reach any specific\nconclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered.\nThe above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contains forward-looking\nstatements and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has unanimously:\n \n\u2022\napproved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\ndetermined and declared that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are\nadvisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders\u037e\n \n\u2022\ndirected that the merger be submitted to the holders of our common stock for approval at the special meeting\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nrecommended that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment\nproposal.\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information",

            "text": "Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nWhile we have from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, we have not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed\ninternal projections as to future performance, earnings or other results beyond the then-current annual period due to, among other reasons, the\nuncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the merger, prior to the execution\nof the merger agreement, our management prepared and provided to our board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger and our\nfinancial advisors, Evercore and Goldman Sachs, for their use and reliance in connection with their financial analyses and opinions, certain non-public,\ninternal financial projections regarding our future operations for fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2027 (the \u201cfinancial\nprojections\u201d).\nThe following tables summarize the financial projections:\n \n(dollar amounts in millions, except per share amounts)\nFiscal Year Ending December 31,\nRun-Rate\nNTM Year (1)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\nNet acquisition volume (2)\n$1,623 $1,576 $2,013 $ 2,527 $ 3,218 $ 3,581\n\u2014\nTotal revenue\n$\n908 $1,025 $1,166 $ 1,345 $ 1,571 $ 1,846 $\n2,033\nNet operating income (NOI) (3)\n$\n890 $1,004 $1,144 $ 1,320 $ 1,540 $ 1,809 $\n1,995\nAdjusted EBITDA (4)\n$\n820 $\n918 $1,049 $ 1,211 $ 1,418 $ 1,684 $\n1,887\nAdjusted funds from operations (AFFO) (5)\n$\n641 $\n709 $\n802 $\n939 $ 1,115 $ 1,324 $\n1,460\nLevered free cash flow (6)\n$\n592 $\n735 $\n483 $\n436 $\n286 $\n84 $\n1,460\nAFFO per share (7)\n$ 2.28 $ 2.24 $ 2.28 $ 2.40 $ 2.56 $ 2.74 $\n2.84\nDividends per share (8)\n$ 1.59 $ 1.66 $ 1.70 $ 1.74 $ 1.80 $ 1.90\n\u2014\n \n(1)\nEstimates for the next twelve months (\u201cNTM\u201d) following fiscal year 2027 estimates, reflect an estimated run-rate for the NTM based on our portfolio\nand capital structure as of year-end 2027E and cash flows for\n \n45Table of Contents\n2027E adjusted for the run-rate impact of acquisitions, dispositions and financing activity expected to be undertaken during 2027E and anticipated\nannual lease escalators.\n(2)\nRepresents estimated real estate acquisition volume, net of projected property sales.\n(3)\nWe define net operating income (\u201cNOI\u201d) as total revenue less total property costs, including reimbursed costs. NOI is a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance.\n(4)\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d) as total NOI less anticipated general and administrative expenses, including commissions and\nequity compensation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating\nincome or net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.\n(5)\nWe define adjusted funds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) as anticipated net income, excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate property, real estate\nimpairment losses, real estate depreciation and amortization expense and certain revenues and expenses that have no impact on our long-term\noperating performance. AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of\noperating performance.\n(6)\nWe define levered free cash flow as AFFO as adjusted for anticipated changes in net working capital, net acquisitions and the issuance and\nrepayment or repurchase of debt and equity securities.\n(7)\nWe define AFFO per share as AFFO divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the relevant period.\n(8)\nWe define dividends per share as the amount of dividends distributable per share of common stock outstanding at the end of the relevant period.\nImportant Information About the Financial Projections\nThe financial projections are included solely to give our stockholders access to certain information that was made available to our board of\ndirectors and Evercore and Goldman Sachs and used by Evercore and Goldman Sachs in connection with their financial analysis and fairness opinions.\nThe financial projections have not been updated following September 14, 2022 to reflect our current views of our future financial performance, and should\nnot be treated as guidance with respect to projected results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 or any other period. The financial projections are\nsubjective in many respects and were prepared solely for our internal use, for Evercore and Goldman Sachs in connection with their financial analysis and\nfairness opinions. The financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with\npublished guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of\nprospective financial information or GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not compiled, examined, audited or performed any\nprocedures with respect to the financial projections, and has not expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance regarding this information or its\nachievability. The inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by us that the\ninformation is material.\nCertain of the above financial data were not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including NOI, Adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, levered free cash flow\nand AFFO per share. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our financial results and believe that they enhance investors\u2019\nunderstanding of our financial performance and the comparability of our results to prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered\nin isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may\ndiffer from others in the industry and our Adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and levered free cash flow are not necessarily comparable with similar titles used by\nother companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Evercore or Goldman Sachs for purposes of their respective\nopinions to our board of directors as described below in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Opinions of Our Financial Advisors\u201d or by our board of directors in\nconnection with its consideration of the merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the financial\nprojections above.\n \n46\nTable of Contents\nThe financial projections, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables, estimates and assumptions that\nnecessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, net acquisition volume and future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial\nmarket conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond our control. The financial projections were developed\nunder the assumption of continued standalone operation, do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on\nwhich the financial projections were prepared and do not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the merger or any effects of the merger.\nFurther, the financial projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be consummated and should not be viewed as accurate\nor continuing in that context. The financial projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Given that the\nfinancial projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. Important factors that\nmay affect actual results and cause the financial projections to not be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to our\nbusiness (including our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business,\neconomic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and other factors described in the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements\u201d and the risks described in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, which reports can be found as described under \u201cWhere\nYou Can Find More Information.\u201d The financial projections also reflect numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time they were\nprepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the financial\nprojections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized above will be realized. Our stockholders are urged to review\nour most recent SEC filings for a description of the reported and anticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital resources, including\nin \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.\nThe inclusion of the financial projections and accompanying narrative in the table above should not be regarded as an indication that we or our\naffiliates or representatives consider the financial projections to be predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as\nsuch. We and our affiliates and other representatives can provide no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the financial projections,\nand we and our affiliates and representatives undertake no obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the financial projections to reflect\ncircumstances existing after the dates on which the financial projections were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that\nany or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying the financial projections are shown to be in error or are no longer appropriate. Some or all of the\nassumptions that have been made in connection with the preparation of the financial projections may have changed since the date the financial\nprojections were prepared. These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the financial projections, which were prepared as of an earlier\ndate. We and our affiliates and other representatives make no representation regarding our ultimate performance compared to the information contained in\nthe financial projections or that the financial projections will be achieved.\nIn light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the financial projections, our stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if\nany, reliance on the financial projections.\nOpinions of Our Financial Advisors\nOpinion of Evercore\nPursuant to an engagement letter, dated July 27, 2022, we engaged Evercore to act as our financial advisor in connection with the merger. As part of\nthis engagement, our board of directors requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be\nreceived by holders of shares of our common stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the merger. At a\n \n47\nTable of Contents\nmeeting of our board of directors held on September 14, 2022, Evercore rendered to our board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by\ndelivery of a written opinion, dated September 14, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions,\nlimitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore\u2019s written opinion, the merger consideration of $32.25 per share to be received by holders\nof shares of our common stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to\nsuch holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated September 14, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as\nExhibit B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. We encourage you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety.\nEvercore\u2019s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, our board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with\nits evaluation of the merger and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of\nshares of our common stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the merger. The opinion does not constitute a\nrecommendation to our board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the merger, including as to how any holder of our common stock should\nvote or act in respect of the merger. Evercore\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial\nstrategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Evercore, among other things:\n \n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that Evercore deemed to be relevant\u037e\n \n\u2022\nreviewed the financial projections (as defined above in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d), as approved\nfor Evercore\u2019s use by our board of directors\u037e\n \n\u2022\ndiscussed with our management their assessment of our past and current operations, current financial condition and prospects, and the\nfinancial projections\u037e\n \n\u2022\nreviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of our common stock\u037e\n \n\u2022\ncompared our financial performance and our stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded companies that\nEvercore deemed relevant\u037e\n \n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated as of September 14, 2022, of the merger agreement, including the interim\noperating covenants of the Company in the context of the potential closing date of the merger\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nperformed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information\npublicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent\nverification of such information (and assumed no responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and further relied upon\nthe assurances of the management of the Company that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate\nor misleading. With respect to the financial projections, Evercore assumed, with the consent of our board of directors, that the financial projections were\nreasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Company as to the future\nfinancial performance of the Company and the other matters covered thereby. Evercore expressed no view as to the financial projections, or the\nassumptions on which they were based (including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving the financial projections).\n \n48\nTable of Contents\nFor purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the final executed merger agreement did not\ndiffer from the draft merger agreement reviewed by Evercore, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the merger agreement\nwere true and correct, that each party would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the merger agreement and\nthat all conditions to the consummation of the merger would be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. Evercore further assumed, in all respects\nmaterial to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the merger would be\nobtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the merger or\nreduce the contemplated benefits to the holders of our common stock of the merger.\nEvercore did not conduct a physical inspection of our properties or facilities and did not make or assume any responsibility for making any\nindependent valuation or appraisal of our assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities), nor\nwas Evercore furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate our solvency or fair value under any state or federal laws\nrelating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore\u2019s opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to Evercore as of\nSeptember 14, 2022 and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and as could be evaluated as of that date. Subsequent\ndevelopments may affect Evercore\u2019s opinion and Evercore does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nEvercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the holders of our common\nstock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates), from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration. Evercore did not express\nany view on, and its opinion does not address, the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any\nother class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid\nor payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the merger consideration or\notherwise. Evercore was not asked to, nor did it express any view on, and its opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement\nor the merger, including, without limitation, the structure or form of the merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated\nby the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the merger agreement. Evercore\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of\nthe merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business\ndecision of the Company to engage in the merger. In arriving at its opinion, Evercore was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any\nthird party with respect to the acquisition of any or all of the shares of our common stock or any business combination or other extraordinary transaction\ninvolving the Company. Evercore\u2019s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to our board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the\nmerger, including as to how any holder of shares of our common stock should vote or act in respect of the merger. Evercore did not express any opinion\nas to the prices at which shares of our common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets\non the Company or the merger or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability of the Company to pay its\nobligations when they come due. Evercore is not a legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and has assumed the accuracy and completeness of\nassessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.\nSet forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with our board of directors on September 14, 2022 in\nconnection with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by\nEvercore. The order of the analyses described and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by\nEvercore. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data that\nexisted on or before September 13, 2022, the day before Evercore rendered its oral opinion to our board of directors, and is not necessarily indicative of\ncurrent market conditions.\n \n49\nTable of Contents\nFor purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial conditions, industry sector\nperformance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond our control. The estimates\ncontained in Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not necessarily indicative\nof actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by Evercore\u2019s analyses\nand reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect\nthe prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore\u2019s\nanalyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nThe following summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the\nanalyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a\ncomplete description of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore\u2019s\nfinancial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such\nanalyses.\nSummary of Evercore\u2019s Financial Analyses\nDividend Discount Analyses. Evercore performed dividend discount analyses to calculate the implied present value of the estimated dividends per\nshare, to be received by the holders of our common stock on a standalone basis, per the financial projections, to be distributed over the six months\nending December 31, 2022 and the fiscal years of 2023 through 2027, and the implied present value of estimated terminal values derived utilizing the\nperpetuity growth rate method and the NTM exit multiple method. Evercore calculated an implied equity value per share range of our common stock as of\nJune 30, 2022 by discounting back to present value our projected total dividend payments to stockholders, per the financial projections, using mid-year\nconvention discounting and the terminal values calculated under the perpetuity growth rate method and the NTM exit multiple method. For each analysis,\nEvercore utilized a cost of equity discount rate range (based on an estimated range of our cost of equity) of 9.0% to 11.0%.\nUtilizing the perpetuity growth rate method, Evercore estimated terminal values based on varying cost of equity discount rates and perpetuity\ngrowth rates, by applying perpetuity growth rates to the estimate of the 2027 dividend per share, per the financial projections. Evercore utilized a\nperpetuity growth rate range of 3.5% to 4.5%, in each case based on its professional judgment and expertise. The dividend discount analysis utilizing the\nforegoing approach resulted in an implied equity value per share range of $22.82 to $36.29.\nUtilizing the exit multiple method, Evercore estimated terminal values based on exit multiples of the NTM AFFO per share estimate as of December\n31, 2027, per the financial projections. Evercore utilized a NTM AFFO per share exit multiple range of 11.5x to 15.5x, in each case, based on its professional\njudgment and expertise. The dividend discount analysis utilizing the foregoing approach resulted in an implied equity value per share range of $25.67 to\n$35.03.\n \nImplied Equity\nValue Range Per\nShare\nDividend Discount Analysis \u2013 Perpetuity Growth\n$\n22.82 - $36.29\nDividend Discount Analysis \u2013 Exit Multiple\n$\n25.67 - $35.03\nSelected Public Companies Trading Analyses. Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of the Company to corresponding\nfinancial multiples and ratios for the following selected publicly traded companies in the triple-net lease REIT industry (which are referred to in this\nsection as the \u201cselected companies\u201d):\n \n\u2022\nNational Retail Properties, Inc.\n \n50\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nSpirit Realty Capital, Inc.\n \n\u2022\nEssential Properties Realty Trust, Inc.\nAlthough none of these companies is directly comparable to the Company, Evercore selected these companies based on its professional judgment\nbecause they are triple-net lease REITs with business characteristics that, for purposes of its analysis, Evercore considered similar to the business\ncharacteristics of the Company.\nFor purposes of its analyses, for each of the selected companies and the Company, Evercore calculated:\n \n\u2022\nprice per share as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2023 AFFO per share (\u201cPrice/2023E AFFO\u201d)\u037e and\n \n\u2022\ntotal enterprise value (defined as equity market capitalization plus the sum of debt (net of cash), and other applicable adjustments such as\nadjustments for preferred stock and minority interest) as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA (\u201cTEV/2023E\nAdjusted EBITDA\u201d).\nFor each of the selected companies and the Company, Evercore reviewed, among other information, stock price to Wall Street research analyst\nconsensus as published by S&P Capital IQ (\u201cSNL\u201d) (\u201cStreet consensus\u201d), estimated AFFO per share for calendar year 2023, and aggregate total\nenterprise value to Street consensus estimated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) for calendar year 2023.\nFinancial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates, public filings and other publicly available\ninformation. For the Company, Evercore additionally calculated Price/2023E AFFO and TEV/2023E Adjusted EBITDA based on the financial projections.\nThe multiples and ratios for each of the selected companies were calculated using their respective closing prices on September 13, 2022 and were based\non the most recent publicly available information and Street consensus estimates as of September 13, 2022, which represents the closing price for shares\nof our common stock and the selected companies\u2019 common stock on the day prior to the rendering of Evercore\u2019s opinion.\nThe results of these calculations were as follows:\n \nSelected Companies\nPrice /\n2023E\nAFFO\nTEV /\n2023E\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nNational Retail Properties, Inc.\n13.7x\n16.0x\nSpirit Realty Capital, Inc.\n11.2x\n13.0x\nEssential Properties Realty Trust, Inc.\n13.8x\n13.4x\nBased on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore (1) applied a Price/2023E AFFO\nmultiple reference range of 11.0x to 15.0x to our estimate of 2023 AFFO per share, as reflected in the financial projections, and (2) applied a TEV/2023E\nAdjusted EBITDA multiple reference range of 13.0x to 16.0x to our estimate of 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, as reflected in the financial projections. Evercore\nthen derived corresponding ranges of implied equity values per share as set forth below, which Evercore compared to the proposed merger consideration\nof $32.25 per share.\n \nImplied Equity\nValue Range Per\nShare\nPrice / 2023E AFFO\n$\n24.62 - $33.57\nTEV / 2023E Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n25.58 - $35.30\nIn evaluating the selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market conditions\naffecting the selected companies and other matters, as well as differences in the selected companies\u2019 financial, business and operating characteristics.\nAccordingly, an evaluation of the results of these analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, these analyses involve complex considerations and\njudgments regarding many factors that could affect the relative values of the selected companies and the multiples derived from the selected companies.\nMathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the selected companies.\n \n51\nTable of Contents\nOther Financial Analyses. The analyses and data described below were presented to our board of directors for informational and reference\npurposes only and did not provide the basis for, and were not otherwise material to, the rendering of Evercore\u2019s opinion.\nPrecedent Transaction Analysis. Evercore reviewed publicly available information related to selected precedent acquisition transactions involving\nthe triple-net lease REIT industry announced since 2012. Based on the multiples it derived from the selected precedent transactions and based on its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Evercore selected a reference range of one calendar-year forward AFFO per share multiples of 13.0x to 15.0x.\nEvercore then applied the multiple reference ranges to our estimate of 2023 AFFO per share, as reflected in the financial projections, and derived\ncorresponding ranges of implied equity values per share of our common stock of $29.09 to $33.57.\nPremiums / Discounts to Net Asset Value. For the Company and each of the selected companies, Evercore reviewed stock price premiums and\ndiscounts to the Street consensus estimate of net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share. Based on the premiums and discounts derived for the Company and the\nselected companies, and its professional judgement and experience, Evercore applied a range of premiums to the Street consensus estimate of NAV per\nshare, as of September 13, 2022, for the Company to derive an implied per share equity value. Evercore selected a range of premiums of 0% to 15% and\nderived corresponding ranges of implied equity values per share of our common stock of $28.96 to $33.30. Additionally, Evercore evaluated the proposed\nmerger consideration of $32.25 relative to the estimate of Green Street of our NAV per share, as of September 13, 2022, of $24.85.\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets. Evercore reviewed selected publicly available stock price targets of research analysts\u2019 estimates known to\nEvercore as of September 13, 2022, the day prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to our board of directors, for shares of our common stock. As\nof September 13, 2022, the range of selected equity research analyst price targets per share of our common stock was $25.00 to $37.00. The mean price\ntarget of research analysts\u2019 estimates known to Evercore, as of September 13, 2022, was $31.32 per share and the median price target, as of the same date,\nwas $31.00 per share. Public market price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for shares\nof our common stock, and these target prices and the analysts\u2019 earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties,\nincluding factors affecting our financial performance and future general industry and market conditions.\n52-Week Trading Range. Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of our common stock during the 52-week period ended September 13,\n2022, noting that the low and high intraday prices during such period ranged from $24.48 to $36.13 per share of our common stock, respectively.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by\nEvercore to our board of directors. In connection with the review of the merger by our board of directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and\ncomparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible\nto partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without considering the analyses as a\nwhole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore\u2019s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the\nresults of all of the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of\nits opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and experience after considering the results of\nall of the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have\ndeemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or\ncombination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the\n \n52\nTable of Contents\nview of Evercore with respect to the actual value of the shares of our common stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not\nequaling the total of the figures shown. Further, Evercore\u2019s analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating\ncharacteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies used, including judgments and\nassumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are\nbeyond the control of the Company or its advisors.\nEvercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to our board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the merger consideration to be received by holders of our common stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates). These\nanalyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which such business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates\ncontained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested\nby such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore\u2019s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and\nEvercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in such estimates.\nEvercore\u2019s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of our board of directors (in its capacity as\nsuch) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger. The issuance of Evercore\u2019s opinion was approved by an opinion committee of Evercore.\nEvercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to our board of directors or management or that any specific amount of\nconsideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the merger for the holders of our common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of our engagement letter with Evercore, we have agreed to pay Evercore an aggregate transaction fee that is estimated, based\non the information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $31 million, of which $3 million was payable upon the delivery of\nEvercore\u2019s opinion, and the balance of which will become payable upon the consummation of the merger. We have also agreed to reimburse Evercore for\nits reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify Evercore against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.\nDuring the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates provided financial advisory or other services to us, for which\nEvercore and its affiliates earned capital markets fees and commissions of less than $1.0 million. During the two-year period prior to the date of its\nopinion, Evercore and its affiliates provided financial advisory or other services to GIC, for which Evercore and its affiliates received fees of less than\n$47.0 million, and none of which fees related to the merger or involved the Company. During the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore\nand its affiliates provided financial advisory or other services to Blue Owl, for which Evercore and its affiliates earned capital markets fees and\ncommissions of less than $2.0 million, and none of which fees related to the merger or involved the Company. Evercore or its affiliates may provide\nfinancial advisory or other services to the Company, Parent, GIC, Oak Street and/or Blue Owl in the future, and in connection with any such services\nEvercore or its affiliates may receive compensation.\nEvercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of customers, including corporate\nfinance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In\nconnection with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in\nwhich any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or otherwise effect\ntransactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial\ninstruments of or relating to the Company, Parent and its affiliates, GIC, potential parties to the merger and their respective affiliates or persons that are\ncompetitors, customers or suppliers of the Company, Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates.\n \n53\nTable of Contents\nWe engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore\u2019s qualifications, experience and reputation. Evercore is an internationally\nrecognized investment banking firm and regularly provides fairness opinions in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes.\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs\nPursuant to an engagement letter, dated July 27, 2022, we engaged Goldman Sachs to act as our financial advisor in connection with the merger. At\na meeting of our board of directors held on September 14, 2022, Goldman Sachs rendered to our board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently\nconfirmed in its written opinion, dated September 15, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, and based upon and\nsubject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, the $32.25 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the\nholders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to\nsuch holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated September 15, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion, is attached as Exhibit C to this\nproxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference.

In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of our board of directors that the financial\nprojections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of our management. Goldman Sachs did\nnot make an independent evaluation or appraisal of our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-\nbalance-sheet assets and liabilities) and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all\ngovernmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained without any adverse effect\non the expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs assumed that the merger would be consummated on the\nterms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful\nto its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger, or the relative merits of the\nmerger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting\nmatters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from third parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business\ncombination with, the Company or any other alternative transaction.

The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description\nof the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those\nanalyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read\ntogether with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. In connection with its opinion,\nGoldman Sachs considered, among other things, Sections 2(3)(a) and 5(b)(ii) of the merger agreement, pursuant to which the Company shall not declare\nand pay the regular quarterly dividend per share of common stock for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022 in an amount of $0.41 per share of\ncommon stock, as estimated in the financial projections.

Although none of the selected companies is directly\ncomparable to the Company, the selected companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of\nanalysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of the Company.\nFor each of the Company and the selected companies, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared:\n \n\u2022\nthe closing price per share, on September 13, 2022, as a multiple of the NTM AFFO for such company (the \u201cCurrent P/NTM AFFO\u201d)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe average of each company\u2019s historical price to NTM AFFO multiples for the one year and five years ended September 13, 2022 (the \u201cLast\n1 Year Average P/NTM AFFO\u201d and the \u201cLast 5 Years Average P/NTM AFFO,\u201d respectively)\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe median of each of the selected companies\u2019 average price to NTM AFFO multiples for such periods.\nThe multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs for the Company and the selected companies are as follows:\n \nCompany / Selected Company\nCurrent\nP/NTM\nAFFO\nLast 1\nYear\nAverage\nP/NTM\nAFFO\nLast 5\nYears\nAverage\nP/NTM\nAFFO\nCompany\n11.8x\n14.0x\n15.5x\nSelected Companies\nNational Retail Properties, Inc.\n13.9x\n14.5x\n16.0x\nSpirit Realty Capital, Inc.\n11.5x\n12.9x\n12.7x\nEssential Properties Realty Trust, Inc.\n14.3x\n17.3x\n17.1x\nSelected Companies Median\n13.9x\n14.5x\n16.0x\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis to derive a range of illustrative present\nvalues per share of our common stock, based on theoretical future prices calculated by Goldman Sachs for our common stock.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share of our common stock as of December 31 of each of 2023, 2024 and 2025 by\napplying illustrative price to NTM AFFO multiples ranging from 11.5x to 15.5x to estimates of our AFFO per share for each of fiscal years 2024, 2025, and\n2026, respectively, as reflected in the financial projections. By applying a discount rate of 9.0%, reflecting an estimate of our cost of equity, Goldman\nSachs discounted to present value, as of June 30, 2022, and summed both the\n \n57\nTable of Contents\ntheoretical future values per share of common stock it derived for each applicable year and the estimated dividends to be paid per share of common stock\non a stand-alone basis through the end of the applicable year as reflected in the financial projections, to yield illustrative present values per share of our\ncommon stock ranging from $25.33 to $34.41.\nThe illustrative price to NTM AFFO multiples used in the foregoing analysis were derived by Goldman Sachs using its professional judgement and\nexperience, taking into account the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth above under \u201c\u2014Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs derived the discount rate used in the foregoing analysis by application of the capital asset pricing model (\u201cCAPM\u201d), which requires\ncertain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the U.S. financial markets generally.\nIllustrative Levered Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the financial projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative levered discounted\ncash flow analysis on the Company to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of our common stock.\nUsing discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%, reflecting estimates of our cost of equity, Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative present\nvalues per share of our common stock, by discounting to present value as of June 30, 2022, (1) the estimates of the levered free cash flow to be generated\nby the Company for the period from July 1, 2022 to December 31, 2027, as reflected in the financial projections, and (2) a range of illustrative terminal\nvalues for the Company as of December 31, 2027, calculated by applying a range of terminal year multiples of 11.5x to 15.5x to our estimated terminal year\nAFFO, as reflected in the financial projections (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from (0.5)% to 3.4%). Goldman Sachs derived such\ndiscount rates by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial\nmetrics for the U.S. financial markets generally. The range of terminal year multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment\nand experience, taking into account the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth above under \u201c\u2014Selected Publicly Traded Companies\nAnalysis.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative present values per share of our common stock by adding the ranges of present values it calculated for\nthe levered free cash flow and illustrative terminal values, as described above, and then dividing the result by the implied total number of fully diluted\nshares of common stock estimated to be outstanding as of September 13, 2022, calculated based on equity information provided by our senior\nmanagement. This analysis resulted in a range of illustrative present values per share of our common stock of $25.10 to $34.75.\nPremia Paid Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the premia paid in all-cash acquisition\ntransactions of publicly traded REITs in the United States announced since 2017 through September 13, 2022 with a transaction value of greater than $1\nbillion.\nFor the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the minimum, 25th percentile, median, mean, 75th percentile\nand the maximum premia of the price paid in these transactions relative to the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to the announcement of\nthe transaction. This analysis indicated a minimum premium of 5.1%, a 25th percentile premium of 15.4%, a median premium of 22.4%, a mean premium of\n29.5%, a 75th percentile premium of 30.3% and a maximum premium of 123.5%. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs then applied an illustrative premia\nrange of 15.4% to 30.3%, corresponding to the 25th and 75th percentiles premia described above, to the undisturbed closing price per share of our\ncommon stock of $27.11 as of September 13, 2022, the day prior to the date of our board of directors\u2019 approval of the merger, and calculated a range of\nimplied values per share of our common stock of $31.28 to $35.32.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without\n \n58\nTable of Contents\nconsidering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness\ndetermination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered\nby it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results\nof all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or the merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to our board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of\nview to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the $32.25 in cash per share of\ncommon stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily\nreflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon projections of future results are not necessarily indicative\nof actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently\nsubject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company,\nParent, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasts.\nThe consideration of $32.25 in cash per share of our common stock was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and\nParent and was approved by our board of directors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to our board of directors during our negotiations with Parent in\nconnection with the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to our board of directors or\nthat any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to our board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by our board of directors\nin making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses\nperformed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the delivery of its fairness opinion to our board of directors and is qualified in its entirety by reference to\nthe written opinion of Goldman Sachs, attached as Exhibit C to this proxy statement.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment\nmanagement and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities.

Affiliates of Goldman\nSachs may also have co-invested with GIC, Blue Owl and their affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of\nGIC and Blue Owl from time to time and may do so in the future.\nWe selected Goldman Sachs as our financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial\nexperience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to the terms of our engagement letter with Goldman Sachs, we have agreed to pay Goldman\nSachs an aggregate transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $31 million,\nof which $28 million is contingent upon completion of the merger. In addition, we agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities\nunder the federal securities laws.\n \n60\nTable of Contents\nFinancing of the Merger\nGeneral\nParent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the merger, Parent expects to assume the non-recourse net-lease mortgage notes\noutstanding under our STORE Master Funding debt program and the outstanding indebtedness under our public unsecured notes. Parent has also\ninformed us that it expects the outstanding indebtedness under our traditional non-recourse mortgage notes, unsecured revolving credit facility, private\nplacement unsecured notes and unsecured bank term loans to be prepaid or remain outstanding. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $2.3\nbillion in aggregate principal amount of consolidated secured indebtedness outstanding, including approximately $2.1 billion in non-recourse net-lease\nmortgage notes and approximately $141.8 million in non-recourse mortgage notes. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $2.6 billion in\naggregate principal amount of consolidated unsecured indebtedness outstanding, including $223 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility,\n$1.8 billion under our unsecured notes and $600 million under our unsecured bank term loans.\nWe anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be\napproximately $10.8 billion, including the funds needed to:\n \n\u2022\npay an aggregate of approximately $9.1 billion to the holders of our common stock, including the holders of restricted stock and\nperformance units (other than excluded stock)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nassume, repay or refinance our existing indebtedness in connection with the consummation of the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement\u037e and\n \n\u2022\npay all fees, expenses and other obligations required to be paid or satisfied in connection with the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement.\nParent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of the following: (1) the equity financing in an aggregate amount of approximately\n$8.2 billion\u037e and (2) the debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $2.6 billion.\nThe merger agreement does not contain a financing condition to the closing of the merger. We have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to\nprovide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and customary in\nconnection with the arrangement of debt financing, the assumption of indebtedness and other transactions. For more information, see the sections\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Financing Cooperation\u201d and \u201c\u2014Conditions to the Merger.\u201d\nEquity Financing\nOn September 15, 2022, an affiliate of GIC and Oak Street each entered into their respective equity commitment letters (together, the \u201cequity\ncommitment letters\u201d) with Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to which an affiliate of GIC and Oak Street committed to contribute (or cause to be\ncontributed) to Parent up to approximately $8.2 billion in cash in the aggregate (the \u201cequity commitment\u201d) on the terms and subject to the conditions set\nforth in the equity commitment letters. The equity commitments are subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others, the consummation\nof the merger in accordance with the merger agreement substantially concurrently with or immediately following the funding of the equity commitment,\nthe satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the merger and the availability of the debt financing to be\nfunded at the closing.\nIn addition, an affiliate of GIC and Oak Street have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of their respective equity commitment letters, to\nguarantee certain payment obligations of Parent, including the obligation to pay the Parent termination fee (as described in more detail under \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d), certain expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations and certain obligations to pay our expenses and\ncosts (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) relating to any legal\n \n61\nTable of Contents\nproceeding brought by us against Parent if Parent fails to pay the Parent termination fee or such expenses and costs, together with interest, if we prevail\nin such legal proceeding (the \u201cpayment obligations\u201d). The payment obligations of each of the Sponsors are subject to a cap in an amount equal to such\nSponsor\u2019s specified percentage share of the Payment Obligations, if and when due pursuant to the merger agreement.\nDebt Financing\nParent has informed us that it has received, in connection with the entry into the merger agreement, a debt commitment letter, originally dated as of\nSeptember 15, 2022 and amended as of September 30, 2022, from Column Financial, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (as the same may be amended\nor supplemented pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, collectively with the related redacted fee letters, the \u201cdebt commitment letter\u201d), providing\nfor the debt financing in an aggregate principal amount equal to $2.6 billion, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment\nletter, and that it may seek to obtain additional debt financing in connection with the merger. The lenders\u2019 obligations to provide the debt financing under\nthe debt commitment letter are subject to customary conditions, including, among others, the receipt of certain specified financial statements, the\nexecution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the debt financing and the closing of the merger immediately prior to, or substantially\nconcurrently with, the funding of the debt financing. The debt commitment under the debt commitment letter expires on April 7, 2023, unless extended in\nwriting by the parties.\nEquity Syndication\nFollowing the no-shop period start date, the Parent Parties, the Sponsors and their respective affiliates, may, at Parent\u2019s sole expense, solicit,\nnegotiate and enter into investment agreements with potential equity investors in Parent and/or a direct or indirect subsidiary or holding company of\nParent (the \u201cequity syndication\u201d). The merger agreement provides that no equity investor may be included, directly or indirectly, in the equity\nsyndication if the contemplated investment by such equity investor results or would be reasonably likely to result (other than, in each case, in de minimis\nrespects) in: (1) the imposition of new, or additional, conditions to the closing, diminution of the likelihood of the closing occurring, or adverse impact on\nthe debt financing, (2) any delay of the closing (including any delay in filing for, or obtaining, the CFIUS approval), or (3) any adverse impact on the\nlikelihood of receiving any required consents from any governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nSubject to certain terms and conditions in the merger agreement, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and will cause each of our\nsubsidiaries and our and their respective representatives to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, to the Parent Parties cooperation reasonably\nrequested and customary in connection with the equity syndication. Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to reimburse us for any out-of-pocket costs\nincurred by us and our subsidiaries in connection with the equity syndication and indemnify us and our subsidiaries and affiliates and representatives\nfrom and against any and all documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims, judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements,\nawards and liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the equity syndication and any information utilized in connection therewith.\nNotwithstanding the entry into or consummation of the equity syndication, the equity commitment letters will remain in full force and effect, and the\nequity syndication will not in any way reduce or otherwise limit the aggregate commitment or any obligations or liability under the equity commitment\nletters of the parties thereto.\nInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of our board of directors to approve the merger and the other proposals described above, our stockholders\nshould be aware that our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our\nstockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and considered\nthem, among other matters, in reaching its unanimous decision to approve the merger, the merger agreement and\n \n62\nTable of Contents\nthe other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, the transaction committee, which was composed exclusively of non-employee,\nindependent directors, considered these interests, among other matters, in reaching its decisions related to the merger, the merger agreement and the\nother transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including during executive sessions of the transaction committee without management\npresent. These interests are discussed below.\nFor purposes of this section, the \u201cexecutive officers\u201d include our current executive officers, Mary B. Fedewa, Sherry L. Rexroad, Chad A. Freed,\nCraig A. Barnett, Tyler S. Maertz, Lori Markson and David Alexander McElyea and our former executive officers, Catherine Long and Christopher H. Volk.\nAlthough Ms. Long and Mr. Volk are no longer executive officers of the Company due to their ceasing employment in November 2021 and December 2021,\nrespectively, we have included in this section information with respect to each of Ms. Long and Mr. Volk because they were executive officers during the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and will receive compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. This section does not include\ninformation with respect to Einar A. Seadler because, while he was a member of our board of directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, he\nleft our board on February 17, 2022 and will not receive any compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger.\nTreatment of Compensatory Awards\nRestricted Stock. The merger agreement provides that, effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding award of restricted\nstock granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and repurchase rights thereon will lapse,\nand thereafter all shares of our common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will\nhave the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration, less required withholding taxes.\nPerformance Units. The merger agreement provides that, effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, outstanding awards of\nperformance units granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan will automatically become earned and vested as further described below under the\nsection entitled \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits,\u201d and thereafter will be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such\ncancelled vested performance units will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive as of the merger effective time, in\nconsideration for the cancellation of such vested performance unit and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the merger\nconsideration and (2) the number of so-determined earned performance shares subject to such vested performance units, without interest, less required\nwithholding taxes. In addition, on the closing date, we will pay each holder of performance units an amount equivalent to all cash dividends that would\nhave been paid on the number of so-determined earned shares of our common stock subject to such performance units as if they had been issued and\noutstanding from the date of grant up to, and including, the merger effective time, less required withholding taxes.\nValue of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would become payable to each of our named executive\nofficers, see \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits\u201d below. The estimated value of the payments that will be made to the executive officers\nat the merger effective time in respect of their outstanding shares of restricted stock and performance units is approximately $31.0 million, which is based\non the aggregate number of shares of restricted stock and performance units held by the executive officers as of October 24, 2022. The estimated value of\nthe payments that will be made to our non-employee directors at the merger effective time in respect of their outstanding shares of restricted stock is\napproximately $1.6 million, which is based on the number of shares of restricted stock held by the non-employee directors as of October 24, 2022. These\nestimated values are based on the merger consideration of $32.25 per share and assume that all shares of restricted stock and performance units held by\nthe executive officers and non-employee directors as of October 24, 2022, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this filing, remain outstanding as\nof the merger effective time and each of them does not receive any additional equity awards between such date and the merger effective time. In addition,\nthe estimate includes an amount equivalent to all\n \n63\nTable of Contents\ncash dividends that would have been paid on the number of earned shares of common stock subject to the performance units as if such shares had been\nissued and outstanding from the date of grant up to, and including, the merger effective time.\nEmployment Agreements\nWe are party to an employment agreement with each of our current executive officers, which provide for the severance benefits described below in\nthe event of certain terminations of employment or a change in control of the Company. The severance benefits payable to each executive officer will be\nsubject to compliance with the restrictive covenants described below. The following descriptions of the terms of the employment agreements with our\ncurrent executive officers are intended as a summary only and, with respect to our named executive officers, are qualified in their entirety by reference to\nthe employment agreements filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on\nFebruary 25, 2022, and the employment agreement that was filed as an exhibit to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022,\nwhich was filed with the SEC on May 6, 2022.\nExecutive Severance Benefits. The employment agreements with the executive officers provide that, if the employment of an executive officer is\nterminated by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive officer for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each as defined in the applicable employment agreement), the\nexecutive officer will be eligible to receive the following benefits in addition to the executive officer\u2019s accrued obligations (as defined in the applicable\nemployment agreement):\n \n\u2022\nan amount equal to the cash bonus at the target percentage for which the executive officer is eligible for the year in which the termination of\nemployment occurs, prorated for the portion of such year during which the executive officer was employed by the Company\u037e\n \n\u2022\nan amount equal to two times the sum of (1) the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary in effect on the date of the termination and (2) the\ngreater of (a) the average cash bonus received by the executive officer for the last two completed fiscal years or (b) the cash bonus at the\ntarget percentage (calculated on the basis of a full fiscal year) for which the executive officer was eligible during the last completed fiscal\nyear\u037e\n \n\u2022\nmonthly reimbursement for COBRA health insurance for a period of 12 months following the executive officer\u2019s termination of employment,\nin an amount equal to (1) the monthly COBRA health insurance premium minus (2) the monthly health insurance premium the executive\nofficer would have paid under our health plan had the executive officer not terminated employment\u037e and\n \n\u2022\naccelerated vesting of all of the executive officer\u2019s unvested shares of restricted stock.\nGolden Parachute Excise Tax. The employment agreements with each of our executive officers provide that if the payments and benefits provided\nto the executive officer in connection with the merger would be subject to an excise tax by reason of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, such benefits\nand payments will be reduced to the extent necessary to prevent any portion of the executive officer\u2019s merger-related payments and benefits from\nbecoming subject to such excise tax, but only if, by reason of that reduction, the net after-tax benefit received by the executive officer exceeds the net\nafter-tax benefit the executive officer would receive if no reduction was made. None of the employment agreements provide for indemnification or \u201cgross-\nup\u201d payments for golden parachute excise tax liabilities.\nRestrictive Covenants.

On October 28,\n2022, October 31, 2022 and November 1, 2022, respectively, purported stockholders of the Company filed lawsuits against the Company and the current\nmembers of our board of directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuits are captioned O\u2019Dell v. STORE\nCapital Corp. et al., No. 1:22-cv-09273 (filed October 28, 2022), Klein v. STORE Capital Corp. et al., No. 1:22-cv-09310 (filed October 31, 2022) and\nGrossman v. STORE Capital Corp. et al., No. 1:22-cv-09357 (filed November 1, 2022).\nThe complaints generally allege, among other things, that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company in connection with the merger fails\nto disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The alleged\nomissions generally relate to (1) certain financial projections prepared by the Company, (2) certain financial analyses of the Company\u2019s financial advisors\nand (3) certain statements concerning the sales process. Plaintiffs in each pending lawsuit seek, among other things, an injunction barring the merger or,\nin the alternative, rescission of the merger to the extent it is already implemented, and an award of damages.\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of the matters cannot be predicted with any certainty, we believe that each of these lawsuits is without merit.\nAdditional lawsuits arising out of the merger may also be filed in the future.\n \n68\nTable of Contents\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",

This discussion is based on current law, is for\ngeneral information only and is not tax advice. This discussion is based on the Code, applicable Treasury Regulations, and administrative and judicial\ninterpretations thereof, each as in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change or to different interpretations, possibly with retroactive\neffect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. We have not requested, and do not\nplan to request, any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), concerning our tax treatment or the tax treatment of the merger, and the\nstatements in this proxy statement are not binding on the IRS or any court. We can provide no assurance that the tax consequences contained in this\ndiscussion will not be challenged by the IRS, or if challenged, will be sustained by a court.\nThis discussion does not address (1) U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes, (2) state, local or non-U.S. taxes, (3) tax reporting requirements, or\n(4) withholding taxes under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as FATCA). This discussion assumes that\nshares of our common stock are held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and does\nnot address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances or to persons that\nare subject to special tax rules and does not address the tax consequences of the merger to holders of restricted stock, performance units, or other awards\nreceived as compensation.

If you are a partner of a\npartnership or a member of a limited liability company or other entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that entity is\nholding our common stock, you should consult your tax advisor. Moreover, each holder should consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income\ntax consequences to it of the merger in light of its own particular situation, as well as any consequences of the merger to such holder arising under the\nlaws of any other taxing jurisdiction.\nFor purposes of this section, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n \n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n \n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state or political subdivision thereof\u037e\n \n\u2022\na trust (1) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and with respect to which one or more \u201cUnited\nStates persons\u201d (as defined under the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions or (2) that has a valid election in effect\nunder applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nan estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.\nAs used in this section, a \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is not a U.S. holder or an entity treated as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThis discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not binding on the IRS. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not\nassert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any described herein.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RULES APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER AND DISPOSING OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND TO REITS\nGENERALLY ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND COMPLEX. HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS\nREGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL,\nSTATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS, AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS, IN LIGHT OF THEIR\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.\nTax Treatment of the Merger\nThe merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a taxable sale by the Company of all of\nits assets to Merger Sub in return for the merger consideration and the assumption of the Company\u2019s liabilities, followed by a deemed liquidation of the\nCompany under Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code. We will be deemed to have distributed the merger consideration to our stockholders in\nconnection with the deemed liquidation. The liquidating distribution will be treated as a dividend for purposes of the dividend paid deduction to the\nextent of our earnings and profits and thus will be sufficient to satisfy our requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income for the taxable year of\nthe merger.\n \n70\nTable of Contents\nConsequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Our Common Stock\nGeneral\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for their shares pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. In general, a U.S. holder of our common stock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between:\n \n\u2022\nthe amount of cash received in exchange for our common stock\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in our common stock.\nGain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of shares, with a block consisting of shares acquired at the same cost in a single\ntransaction. Assuming that the shares constitute capital assets in the hands of the U.S. holders, this gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and\nwill be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the merger the shares have been held for more than one year. An individual U.S. holder will be subject\nto tax on net capital gain at a reduced maximum U.S. federal income tax rate (20% under current law). Additionally, a 3.8% Medicare unearned contribution\ntax will apply to any gain recognized by individuals, trusts and estates whose income exceeds certain threshold levels. Capital gains of corporate U.S.\nholders generally are taxable at the regular tax rate applicable to corporations. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized in the exchange is subject to\nlimitations under the Code. In addition, the IRS has the authority to prescribe, but has not yet prescribed, regulations that would apply a tax rate of 25%\nto a portion of capital gain realized by a non-corporate stockholder on the sale of REIT shares that would correspond to the REIT\u2019s \u201cunrecaptured section\n1250 gain.\u201d\nSpecial Rule for U.S. Holders Who Have Held our Common Stock for Less than Six Months\nA U.S. holder who has held our common stock for less than six months at the time of the merger, taking into account the holding period rules of\nSections 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who recognizes a loss on the exchange of our common stock in the merger, will be treated as recognizing a\nlong-term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received from us, or such holder\u2019s share of any designated retained capital gains, with\nrespect to such shares.\nConsequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Our Common Stock\nGeneral\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to a non-U.S. holder will depend on various factors, including whether the receipt of the\nmerger consideration is treated as a distribution from us to our stockholders that is attributable to gain from the sale of \u201cUnited States real property\ninterests.\u201d The IRS announced in Notice 2007-55 that it intends to (1) take the position that under current law, unless an exception applies, a non-U.S.\nholder\u2019s receipt of a liquidating distribution from a REIT (which would include the receipt of cash in exchange for Company shares in the merger, which,\nas noted above, will be treated as a deemed liquidation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is generally subject to tax under FIRPTA as a distribution to\nthe extent attributable to gain from the sale of United States real property interests and (2) issue regulations that will be effective for transactions\noccurring on or after June 13, 2007, clarifying this treatment. As a result, the following paragraphs provide alternative discussions of the tax\nconsequences that would arise to the extent the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 does or does not apply. Notwithstanding the discussion in the\nfollowing paragraphs, we intend to take the position that the cash received in exchange for our common stock will be subject to tax in accordance with\nNotice 2007-55, subject to the 10% exception described below. In general, the provisions governing the taxation of distributions by REITs can be less\nfavorable to non-U.S. holders than the taxation of sales or exchanges of REIT shares by non-U.S. holders, and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax\nadvisors regarding the application of these provisions.\n \n71\nTable of Contents\nDistribution of Gain from the Disposition of U.S. Real Property Interests\nTo the extent the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 applies, and to the extent cash received by non-U.S. holders in the merger is attributable\nto gain from the deemed sale of our United States real property interests (which we expect to be a substantial portion of such cash), then, subject to the\n10% exception described below, such amount will be treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S.\nholder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder (and the non-U.S. holder would generally\nbe required to file a U.S. federal income tax return reporting such income). A corporate non-U.S. holder will also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax\n(or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty). In addition, 21% of any such amounts paid to a non-U.S. holder will be\nrequired to be withheld and remitted to the IRS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a non-U.S. holder has not owned more than 10% of our common stock\nat any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the merger and our common stock is treated as \u201cregularly traded,\u201d as defined by applicable\nTreasury Regulations, on an established securities market located in the United States, the tax treatment described above would not apply, in which case\nwe intend to take the position that such non-U.S. holder would instead be subject to the rules described below in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Taxable Sale of\nOur Common Stock.\u201d We believe that our common stock is, and will be at the effective time of the merger, treated as regularly traded on an established\nsecurities market in the United States.\nTaxable Sale of Our Common Stock\nTo the extent the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 does not apply (or, in the event a holder qualifies for the 10% exception described above),\nthen subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a non-U.S. holder should not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on any gain or loss\nfrom the merger unless: (1) the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if an\napplicable income tax treaty applies, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States\u037e (2) the\nnon-U.S. holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other requirements are met\u037e\nor (3) such shares constitute \u201cUnited States real property interests\u201d in the non-U.S. holder\u2019s hands under FIRPTA.\nA non-U.S. holder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States will generally be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on such gain on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder (and the non-U.S. holder would generally be required to file a U.S.\nfederal income tax return reporting such income). In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such\nlower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain described in clause (1) of the previous paragraph.\nA non-U.S. holder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and who meets certain\nother requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the merger, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. In addition, the\nnon-U.S. holder may be subject to applicable alternative minimum taxes.\nIf a non-U.S. holder\u2019s shares constitute United States real property interests under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by such holder in the merger will\nbe treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder (and the non-U.S. holder would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return\nreporting such income). A non-U.S. holder\u2019s shares of common stock generally will not constitute U.S. real property interests if either (1) we are a\n\u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d at the merger effective time, or (2) both (a) shares of our common stock are treated as regularly\ntraded on an established securities market at the date of the merger and (b) the non-U.S. holder has held 10% or less of the total fair market value of that\nclass of shares at all times during the shorter of (i) the five-year period ending with the effective time of the merger and (ii) the non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding\nperiod for the shares. As discussed above,\n \n72\nTable of Contents\nwe believe that our common stock will be regularly traded on an established securities market. A \u201cqualified investment entity\u201d includes a REIT. Assuming\nwe qualify as a REIT, we will be a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d at the merger effective time if non-U.S. holders held directly or\nindirectly less than 50% in value of our stock at all times during the five-year period ending with the merger effective time. While we believe that we have\nbeen and currently are \u201cdomestically controlled\u201d as of the date of this proxy statement, no assurances can be given that the actual ownership of our\nshares has been or will be sufficient for us to qualify as a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d at the merger effective time.\nIncome Tax Treaties\nIf a non-U.S. holder is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States, the non-U.S. holder may be able to reduce or\neliminate certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above, such as the branch profits tax. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax\nadvisor regarding possible relief under an applicable income tax treaty.\nU.S. Withholding Tax\nAs described above, it is not entirely clear whether the receipt of the merger consideration by a non-U.S. holder will be treated as a sale or exchange\nof our common stock (in the event Notice 2007-55 does not apply) or as a distribution from us that is attributable to gain from the deemed sale of our\nUnited States real property interests in the merger (in the event Notice 2007-55 does not apply). Accordingly, we intend to withhold U.S. federal income\ntax at a rate of 21% from the portion of the merger consideration that is, or is treated as, attributable to gain from the sale of United States real property\ninterests and paid to a non-U.S. holder unless such holder qualifies for the 10% exception described above.\nA non-U.S. holder may be entitled to a refund or credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, with respect to any amount\nwithheld pursuant to FIRPTA\u037e provided, that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax\nadvisors regarding withholding tax considerations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nBackup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, and information reporting may apply to the cash received pursuant to the exchange of our common\nstock in the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a holder who:\n \n\u2022\nin the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on an\nIRS Form W-9 or successor form\u037e\n \n\u2022\nin the case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes an applicable IRS Form W-8 or successor form\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nis otherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with other applicable rules and certification requirements.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld under these rules may be credited against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax\nliability and may entitle the holder to a refund if required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nPossible Legislative Changes\u2014Possible Change in Tax Rates\nThis discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury Regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of\nthe date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences (including applicable\ntax rates) different from those\n \n73\nTable of Contents\nsummarized above. We cannot assure you that a change in law, including the possibility of major tax legislation, possibly with retroactive application, will\nnot significantly alter the tax consequences (including applicable tax rates) that we describe herein. We have not sought and do not plan to seek any\nruling from the IRS with respect to statements made and the conclusions reached in the above discussion, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or\na court will agree with our statements and conclusions.\nTHE FOREGOING DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE\nMERGER AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. THEREFORE, COMMON STOCKHOLDERS ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX\nADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S.\nFEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS IN THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.\nDelisting and Deregistration of Our Common Stock",

agreement (an \u201calternative acquisition agreement\u201d)\nor otherwise resolve or agree to do so.\nWe refer to any action in the first six bullets above as a \u201cchange in

our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with our outside\nlegal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make a change in

In addition, at any time prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, if we have not breached certain obligations under the merger\nagreement (other than, in the case of certain obligations, any breach that has a de minimis effect), our board of directors may make a change in\nrecommendation and/or terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the\n

thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with our outside legal counsel and financial\nadvisors, constitutes a superior proposal and that, in light of such acquisition proposal, a failure to make a change in recommendation and/or to cause us\nto terminate the merger agreement would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law, after having complied (other than\nany non-compliance that has a de minimis effect) with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to the merger\nagreement, and such acquisition proposal is not withdrawn.\nOur board of directors may make a change in recommendation and/or terminate the merger agreement in accordance with the foregoing paragraph if:\n \n\u2022\nwe have delivered to Parent a prior written notice (a \u201cnotice of change in recommendation\u201d) that includes a statement that our board of\ndirectors intends to take such action, the identity of the person or group of persons making the superior proposal, as applicable, and the\nmaterial terms and conditions of the superior proposal or intervening event, as applicable, that is the basis of such action, including, if\napplicable, copies of any written proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements related to the superior proposal, as applicable (it\nbeing agreed that the delivery of the notice of change in recommendation will not constitute a change in recommendation)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nduring the five business day period following Parent\u2019s receipt of the notice of change in recommendation and ending at 11:59 p.m., Eastern\ntime, on such fifth business day (a \u201cnotice of change period\u201d), we have made our representatives reasonably available for the purpose of\nengaging in negotiations and have negotiated, and have caused our representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent (to the extent\nParent desires to negotiate) regarding such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, so that, in the case of a\nsuperior proposal, such superior proposal ceases to constitute a superior proposal, or, in the case of an intervening event, in order to\nobviate the need to make such change in recommendation\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nafter the expiration of the notice of change period, our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) has determined in good faith,\nafter consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and after taking into account any changes to the merger agreement\nthat the Parent Parties have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by the third bullet point\nabove or otherwise, that (1) in the case of an acquisition proposal, the superior proposal giving rise to the notice of change in\nrecommendation continues to constitute a superior proposal and the failure to make a change in recommendation and/or enter into such\nalternative acquisition agreement would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law and (2) in the case of\nan intervening event, the failure of our board of directors to effect a change in recommendation would be inconsistent with its duties under\napplicable law.\nFor purposes of the merger agreement, \u201cintervening event\u201d means any material change in circumstances that, in each case, occurred or arose after\nthe date hereof that materially affects the business, assets or operations of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which (1) was not known to or\nreasonably foreseeable by, or, if known, the material consequences of which were not known to or reasonably foreseeable by, our board of directors prior\nto the execution of the merger agreement and (2) becomes known to our board of directors prior to the stockholder approval\u037e provided, however, that\nnone of the following will constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has been, an intervening event: (a) the receipt of, or the existence or\nterms of, an acquisition proposal or acquisition inquiry or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof\u037e (b) any matter relating to the Parent Parties,\nthe Sponsors or their respective affiliates\u037e or (c) the fact that, in and of itself, we meet or exceed any internal or public projections or forecasts or estimates\nof revenues, earnings or other financial results for any period (provided, that the underlying causes thereof will not be excluded by this clause (c)).\n \n90\nTable of Contents\nAny amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such a superior proposal will require a new notice of change in\nrecommendation, and we will be required to comply again with the requirements described above\u037e provided, however, that the notice of change period\nwill be reduced to three business days following receipt by Parent of any such new notice of change in recommendation and ending at 11:59 p.m., Eastern\ntime, on such third business day.\nNothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits us, our board of directors or our representatives from:\n \n\u2022\ntaking and disclosing to our stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a\nstatement contemplated by Item

As a result of the Transaction, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the \u201cCompany\nCommon Stock\u201d), other than shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Transaction and then held by the Company, Parent,\nMerger Sub, or any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to receive $32.25 per share in cash (the \u201cMerger\nConsideration\u201d). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d) has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received\nby holders of the Company Common Stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the Transaction is fair, from a financial point\nof view, to such holders.\nIn connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:\n \n(i)\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we deemed to be relevant\u037e\n \n(ii)\nreviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us by management of the\nCompany, as approved for our use by the Company (the \u201cManagement Projections\u201d)\u037e\n \n(iii)\ndiscussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of the Company, the current\nfinancial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Management Projections\u037e\n \n(iv)\nreviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock\u037e\n \n(v)\ncompared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded\ncompanies that we deemed relevant\u037e\n \n(vi)\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated as of September 14, 2022, of the Merger Agreement, including the interim\noperating covenants of the Company in the context of the potential closing date of the Transaction\u037e and\n \n(vii)\nperformed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information\npublicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent\nverification of such information (and\n \nB-1Table of Contents\nThe Board of Directors\nSTORE Capital Corporation\nPage 2\n \nhave not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further relied upon the assurances of the\nmanagement of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With\nrespect to the Management Projections, we have assumed with your consent that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and the\nother matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the Management Projections or the assumptions on which they are based (including their views\non the risks and uncertainties of achieving the Management Projections).\nFor purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the final executed Merger Agreement will\nnot differ from the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by us, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are\ntrue and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all\nconditions to the consummation of the Transaction will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. We have further assumed, in all respects\nmaterial to our analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will\nbe obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the\nTransaction or reduce the contemplated benefits to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the Transaction.\nWe have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and have not made or assumed any responsibility for\nmaking any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and\nliabilities) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the\nCompany under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information made\navailable to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is\nunderstood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.\nWe have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the holders of the Company\nCommon Stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates), from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration.

Our\nopinion does not address the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the\nCompany, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction. In arriving at our opinion, we were not\nauthorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any third party with respect to the acquisition of any or all of the Company Common Stock or any\nbusiness combination or other extraordinary transaction involving the Company.
