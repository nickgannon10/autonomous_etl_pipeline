As a result, 19,561,634 shares of Hanger common stock must be represented by proxy or by\nstockholders present and entitled to vote at the special meeting to have a quorum. Abstentions will be\ncounted as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. Shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d for\nwhich the applicable broker, bank or nominee receives no instructions regarding how to vote on any of the\nproposals before the special meeting will not be counted as present at the special meeting for quorum\npurposes. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting may result in an adjournment of the\nspecial meeting and may subject us to additional expense.\nRequired Vote\nApproval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of\nHanger common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter as of the Record Date (the\n2 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201cCompany Stockholder Approval\u201d). Approval of both the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation\nProposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Hanger common stock\nrepresented in person or by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon.\nStock Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers\nAs of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an\naggregate of 1,528,572 shares of Hanger common stock (excluding any shares that would be delivered upon\nthe vesting, exercise or conversion, as applicable, of Company Options, Company RSUs or Company\nPRSUs), representing approximately 3.9% of the outstanding shares of Hanger common stock.\nOur directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of\nHanger common stock: (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal\u037e and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe Compensation Proposal.\nVoting\nAny Hanger stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by returning a\nsigned proxy card by mail, voting via telephone or Internet, or may attend the special meeting and vote in\nperson. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of Hanger common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d\nthrough a broker, bank or nominee, you should instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how you wish to\nvote your shares of Hanger common stock using the instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee.\nUnder applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks or nominees have the discretion to vote your shares\non certain \u201croutine\u201d matters if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote your shares\nwith respect to such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and brokers,\nbanks and nominees therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is\nimportant that you instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of Hanger\ncommon stock.\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is\nvoted at the special meeting by signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us or voting\nvia telephone or Internet before 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day before the special meeting, by providing\nwritten notice of revocation to Thomas E. Hartman, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary,\nbefore your proxy is exercised or by attending the special meeting and voting in person pursuant to the\ninstructions set forth in \u201cThe Special Meeting\u202f-\u202fRevocability of Proxies\u201d on page 25 of this proxy statement.\nIf you hold your shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should contact your broker, bank or nominee\nfor instructions regarding how to change your vote.\nThe failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, vote via telephone or Internet or vote\nin person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger\nProposal. If you hold your shares of Hanger common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your\nbroker, bank or nominee on how to vote your shares on any of the proposals will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the\nAdjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. A \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d results when banks, brokers and\nnominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable stock exchange rules\nprovide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have\ndiscretionary authority to vote on the proposal and have not received specific voting instructions from the\nbeneficial owner of such shares. Under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks or nominees have the\ndiscretion to vote your shares on certain \u201croutine\u201d matters if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or\nnominee on how to vote your shares with respect to such matters. Hanger does not expect any broker non-\nvotes at the special meeting as the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. Broker non-\nvotes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on the\noutcome of any vote on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d each of the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the\nCompensation Proposal.\n3 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNeither the SEC nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved of the transactions described\nin this proxy statement, including the Merger, passed upon the merits or fairness of such transactions, or passed upon\nthe adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this proxy statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal\noffense.\nExpenses of Proxy Solicitation (page 25)\nOur board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) is soliciting your proxy, and Hanger will bear the cost of soliciting\nproxies. We have engaged the services of MacKenzie Partners, Inc. (\u201cMacKenzie\u201d) to solicit proxies for the\nspecial meeting. In connection with its retention, MacKenzie has agreed to provide consulting, analytic and\nproxy solicitation services in connection with the special meeting. We have agreed to pay MacKenzie a fee\nof approximately $20,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for its services, and we will indemnify\nMacKenzie for certain losses arising out of its proxy solicitation services. In addition to the solicitation of\nproxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, or representatives of\nMacKenzie, in person or by telephone, email, fax, over the Internet or other means of communication, and we\nmay pay persons holding shares of Hanger common stock on behalf of others their expenses for sending\nproxy materials to their principals. No additional compensation will be paid to our directors, officers or\nemployees for their services in connection with solicitation of proxies.\nCertain Effects of the Merger on Hanger (page 31)\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into\nHanger, with Hanger continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nAs a result of the Merger, Hanger will cease to be a publicly traded company and will cease to be listed on\nthe NYSE and its shares will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n\u201cExchange Act\u201d). If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the\nsurviving corporation and instead will only be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in\n\u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d on page 31 of this proxy statement (unless you are entitled to and\nhave properly demanded appraisal for your shares in accordance with, and have complied in all respects\nwith, Section 262 of the DGCL, in which case you will be entitled only to those rights granted under Section\n262 of the DGCL as described in \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fAppraisal Rights\u201d on page 63 of this proxy statement and\nAppendix B to this proxy statement).\nThe effective time of the Merger (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d) will occur upon the filing of the certificate of merger\nwith the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later date and time as we, Parent and Merger\nSub may agree and specify in the certificate of merger.\nEffect on Hanger if the Merger is Not Completed (page 31)\nIf the Merger Proposal is not approved by the stockholders of Hanger or if the Merger is not completed for\nany other reason, you will not receive any payment for your shares of Hanger common stock. Instead, we\nwill remain a public company, Hanger common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and\nregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to be obligated to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nUnder specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, or may be entitled to\nreceive a reverse termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fees\u201d on page 97 of this proxy statement.\nMerger Consideration (page 75)\nAt the Effective Time, each share of Hanger common stock issued and outstanding (other than (i) shares\nheld by Hanger as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly\nowned subsidiary of Hanger, Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) shares of Hanger common stock held by\nstockholders who have not voted in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement, including\nthe Merger, or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised and validly perfected appraisal\nrights for such shares in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the\n\u201cDissenting Shares\u201d)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $18.75 per share in cash,\nwithout interest, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law (the \u201cMerger\nConsideration\u201d). All shares of Hanger common stock converted into the right to receive the Merger\n4 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nConsideration will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and will thereafter\nrepresent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.\nAs described further in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fExchange and Payment Procedures\u201d on page 76 of this\nproxy statement, at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a nationally recognized bank or trust\ncompany, reasonably acceptable to Hanger, to act as the paying agent to make payments of the Merger\nConsideration to Hanger stockholders (the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d) and deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the\nPaying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. Following the completion of the\nMerger, holders of record of shares of Hanger common stock formerly represented by one or more stock\ncertificates will provide the Paying Agent with such stockholder\u2019s stock certificates and other items\nspecified by the Paying Agent, including a letter of transmittal, and the Paying Agent will promptly pay the\nstockholder the Merger Consideration to which such stockholder is entitled. Stockholders who hold shares\nof Hanger common stock in book-entry form (other than shares held through the Depository Trust Company)\nwill not be required to deliver stock certificates to the Paying Agent, but will be required to deliver an\nexecuted letter of transmittal and other items specified by the Paying Agent to the Paying Agent to receive\nthe Merger Consideration to which they are entitled. Holders of shares of Hanger common stock in book-\nentry form who hold such shares through The Depository Trust Company will not be required to deliver an\nexecuted letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration to which they are\nentitled.\nAfter the completion of the Merger, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the\nMerger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a Hanger stockholder (except that stockholders who\nhold Dissenting Shares will not have the right to receive the Merger Consideration but will instead have the right to\nreceive a payment for the \u201cfair value\u201d of their Dissenting Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\npursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described in \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fAppraisal\nRights\u201d on page 63 of this proxy statement and Appendix B to this proxy statement).\nTreatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards (page 54)\nThe Merger Agreement provides, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on\nthe part of Parent, Merger Sub, Hanger or any holder of securities of Hanger, for the following treatment with\nrespect to equity and equity-based awards relating to Hanger common stock:\nStock Options\nEach option to purchase shares of Hanger common stock (each, a \u201cCompany Option\u201d), whether vested or\nunvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and be\nconverted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less any applicable tax\nwithholdings) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Hanger common stock underlying the\nCompany Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of\nsuch Company Option (less any taxes required to be withheld under applicable law). If the exercise price of a\nCompany Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option will be\ncancelled for no consideration.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nEach outstanding award of (i) Hanger restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units or performance-\nbased restricted stock units, in each case that at such time is subject solely to service-based vesting\nconditions (collectively, the \u201cCompany RSUs\u201d), will become fully vested and will automatically be cancelled\nand be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less any applicable tax\nwithholdings) equal to (x) the total number of shares of Hanger common stock underlying such award of\nCompany RSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and (ii) Hanger performance-based restricted\nstock units that at such time is subject to performance-based vesting conditions (collectively, the \u201cCompany\nPRSUs\u201d) will become vested as to the number of shares of Hanger common stock subject to such award that\nwould vest based on target level achievement of all performance targets (without application of any modifier)\nand will, after giving effect to such vesting, automatically and without any required action on the part of the\nholder thereof or Hanger, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without interest)\n5 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nan amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to (x) the number of vested shares of Hanger\ncommon stock underlying such award of Company PRSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and\nthe unvested portion of such Company PRSUs will be cancelled for no consideration.\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger (page 40)\nThe Board, after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and carefully reviewing and\nconsidering various factors described in \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fRecommendation of Our Board of Directors and\nReasons for the Merger\u201d on page 40 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i) determined and declared that\nthe Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to which Hanger is a party and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Hanger and its\nstockholders, (ii) approved the Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to which Hanger is a party and\nthe transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement,\nincluding the Merger, be submitted to the stockholders of Hanger for its adoption and approval and (iv)\nrecommended that Hanger\u2019s stockholders adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger (the \u201cCompany Board Recommendation\u201d).\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the\nAdjournment Proposal\u037e and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal.\nFairness Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.

(\u201cBofA Securities\u201d), Hanger\u2019s financial advisor,\ndelivered to the Board a written opinion, dated July 21, 2022, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view\nand as of the date of the opinion, of the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Hanger common\nstock (other than Dissenting Shares).

BofA Securities provided its opinion to the Board (in its capacity\nas such) for the benefit and use of the Board in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the Merger\nConsideration from a financial point of view. BofA Securities\u2019 opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger\nand no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or\ntransactions that might be available to Hanger or in which Hanger might engage or as to the underlying business\ndecision of Hanger to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Securities\u2019 opinion does not address any other aspect of\nthe Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the\nproposed Merger or any other matter.\nInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger (page 54)\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, you should\nbe aware that certain of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of these interests in,\namong other matters, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger\nAgreement be adopted and approved by the stockholders of Hanger. These interests include the following:\nExecutive Severance Agreements with Hanger. We have entered into severance agreements with\neach of our executive officers which include severance benefits that, upon our termination of the\nexecutive officer\u2019s employment without \u201ccause\u201d or, by each executive officer other than Ms. Adams,\nfor \u201cgood reason\u201d, provide for (i) certain severance payments and (ii) certain reimbursement for\nCOBRA coverage and other employee benefits, as described in \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the\nDirectors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger\u202f-\u202fSeverance and Other Termination\nBenefits\u201d on page 55 of this proxy statement\u037e\nAccelerated Equity Award Vesting.

Hanger has approved an award pool of $350,000 to be paid in the form of\ncash bonuses to certain employees, with individual amounts to be determined by Hanger prior to the\nclosing of the Merger, as described in \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers\nof Hanger in the Merger\u202f-\u202fTransaction Bonus Pool\u201d on page 57 of this proxy statement\u037e\nIndemnification Rights. Our directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification\npursuant to the Merger Agreement and our organizational documents, as well as directors\u2019 and\nofficers\u2019 liability insurance to be maintained by the surviving corporation\u037e and\nCompensation Arrangements with Parent. Parent held introductory discussions with certain members\nof Hanger\u2019s management team in which Parent indicated that (i) it intends to provide for an equity\npool of up to approximately 12% of the equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates for the granting\nof new equity awards to Hanger employees after the closing of the Merger and (ii) it expects members\nof Hanger\u2019s management team to use a portion of the proceeds they receive from the Merger to\npurchase equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates, on customary terms, each as described in\n\u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger\u202f-\u202f\nCompensation Arrangements with Parent\u201d on page 60 of this proxy statement.\nIf the Merger Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the Merger is completed, any vested shares of\nHanger common stock held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as\noutstanding shares of Hanger common stock held by all other stockholders entitled to receive the Merger\nConsideration.\nThese interests are discussed in more detail in \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the Directors and Executive\nOfficers of Hanger in the Merger\u201d on page 54 of this proxy statement.\nFinancing of the Merger (page 60)\nWe anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger, including the funds needed to pay Hanger\nstockholders and holders of other equity-based interests the amounts due to them under the Merger\nAgreement, will be approximately $1.25 billion based upon (i) the consideration payable under the Merger\nAgreement, (ii) the repayment and termination of Hanger\u2019s existing credit agreement and (iii) fees,\ncommissions and expenses in connection with the foregoing, which will be funded through a combination of\nthe following:\na debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to approximately $945 million (the \u201cDebt\nFinancing\u201d and the commitments therefor, the \u201cDebt Financing Commitments\u201d), consisting of (i)\nsenior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $685 million (comprised of an\ninitial $550 million first lien term loan facility, a $35 million delayed draw first lien term loan facility and\na $100 million super senior secured revolving credit facility) and (ii) a senior secured second lien term\nloan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $260 million (comprised of an initial $245 million\nsecond lien term loan facility and a $15 million delayed draw second lien term loan facility), as set\nforth in the debt commitment letter related thereto (the \u201cDebt Commitment Letter\u201d)\u037e and\na cash equity investment by Patient Square Equity Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership\n(\u201cPatient Square Equity\u201d), in an aggregate amount of $410 million (the \u201cEquity Financing\u201d and the\ncommitments therefor, the \u201cEquity Financing Commitment\u201d), as set forth in the equity commitment\nletter related thereto (the \u201cEquity Commitment Letter\u201d and, together with the Debt Commitment\nLetter, the \u201cCommitment Letters\u201d).\nThe funding of the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing (collectively, the \u201cFinancing\u201d) is subject to the\nsatisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter\nunder which the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing will be provided, respectively. The obligation of\nthe parties to complete the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. However, the failure of Parent to\nobtain the Financing (or to secure alternative financing) would likely result in the failure of the Merger to be\ncompleted. If Hanger terminates the Merger Agreement due to Parent\u2019s failure to complete the Merger when\nthe closing conditions have been satisfied, subject to the requirements described in the Merger Agreement,\nParent would be obligated to pay to Hanger a $45 million reverse termination fee.

For a\ndescription of the circumstances in which the reverse termination fee would be paid to Hanger, see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fees\u201d on page 97 of this proxy statement.\nLimited Guaranty (page 62)\nTo induce Hanger to enter into the Merger Agreement, Patient Square Equity entered into a limited guaranty\nin favor of Hanger pursuant to which Patient Square Equity absolutely and irrevocably guaranteed to\nHanger, on the terms and conditions set forth in the limited guaranty, the due, prompt and faithful payment\nof (i) the reverse termination fee payable by Parent to Hanger, if and when due in accordance with the\nMerger Agreement, (ii) if Parent fails to timely pay the reverse termination fee to Hanger, the obligation to\nreimburse Hanger for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the collection of the\nreverse termination fee up to $1,000,000 in the aggregate and interest on such unpaid reverse termination fee,\n(iii) subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, any monetary damages awarded to Hanger\npursuant to a final and non-appealable order by a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of any Willful\nand Material Breach (as defined in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination of the Merger Agreement\u201d on page\n95 of this proxy statement) by Parent or Merger Sub of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) any reimbursement\nand/or indemnification obligations of Parent to Hanger and its subsidiaries and each of their respective\ndirectors, officers and other representatives that may arise pursuant to the Merger Agreement with respect to\nthe Debt Financing (collectively, the \u201cGuaranteed Obligations\u201d)\u037e provided, that the maximum amount\npayable by Patient Square Equity under the limited guaranty may not exceed $50 million.\nTransaction Litigation (page 63)\nFollowing the announcement of the Merger on July 21, 2022, two substantially similar actions have been filed\nby purported Hanger stockholders against Hanger and our board of directors, and Hanger has received one\ndemand letter. On August 9, 2022, a lawsuit styled Stein v. Hanger, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 22-cv-6775\nwas filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On August 17, 2022, a\nlawsuit styled Singh v. Hanger, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 22-cv-07023 was filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints and demand letter assert similar claims\nagainst Hanger and our board of directors under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9\npromulgated under the Exchange Act. The complaints and demand letter allege, among other things, that the\npreliminary proxy statement filed August 5, 2022 with the SEC misstated or omitted material information\nregarding the financial projections, the financial analyses performed by Hanger\u2019s financial advisor, potential\nconflicts of interest of our board of directors and management and the sales process leading up to the\nMerger. The complaints seek to enjoin the Merger unless and until the alleged omitted material information is\ndisclosed, rescission of the Merger Agreement and/or rescissory damages, compensatory damages,\nattorneys\u2019 fees and other litigation costs. Hanger believes the lawsuits and the demand letter are without\nmerit and intends to vigorously defend against them. Additional lawsuits and demand letters arising out of\nor relating to the Merger Agreement or the Merger may be filed or made in the future, which could prevent or\ndelay completion of the Merger and result in additional costs to the Company. If additional similar\ncomplaints or demands are filed or made, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company\nwill not necessarily announce them.\nAppraisal Rights (page 63)\nIf the Merger is approved by our stockholders and becomes effective, holders of Dissenting Shares will be\nentitled to statutory appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such\nstockholders are entitled to seek appraisal of their Dissenting Shares and to receive payment in cash for the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of such Dissenting Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to\nbe paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The ultimate amount holders receive in an appraisal\nproceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount such holders would have received under the\nMerger Agreement. For a description of the rights of holders of Dissenting Shares and of the procedures to\nbe followed to assert such rights and obtain payment of the fair value of such Dissenting\n8 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nShares, see Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement, as well as the\ninformation set forth below.\nTO PROPERLY EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, YOU MUST\nDELIVER A WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF\nSECTION 262 OF THE DGCL TO HANGER BEFORE THE VOTE IS TAKEN ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL AT\nTHE SPECIAL MEETING, MUST NOT VOTE, IN PERSON OR BY PROXY, IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER\nPROPOSAL, MUST CONTINUE TO HOLD YOUR SHARES OF HANGER COMMON STOCK OF RECORD\nFROM THE DATE OF MAKING THE DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE TIME AND\nMUST COMPLY WITH THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. MERELY VOTING\nAGAINST, OR ABSTAINING FROM VOTING OR FAILING TO VOTE WITH RESPECT TO, THE MERGER\nPROPOSAL WILL NOT PRESERVE YOUR RIGHT TO APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL.\nBECAUSE A PROXY THAT IS SIGNED AND SUBMITTED BUT DOES NOT OTHERWISE CONTAIN\nVOTING INSTRUCTIONS WILL, UNLESS REVOKED, BE VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL,\nIF YOU SUBMIT A PROXY AND WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU MUST INCLUDE\nVOTING INSTRUCTIONS TO VOTE YOUR SHARES OF HANGER COMMON STOCK AGAINST, OR\nABSTAIN WITH RESPECT TO, THE MERGER PROPOSAL. NEITHER VOTING AGAINST THE MERGER\nPROPOSAL, NOR ABSTAINING FROM VOTING OR FAILING TO VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL,\nWILL IN AND OF ITSELF CONSTITUTE A WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL SATISFYING THE\nREQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. THE WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL MUST BE\nIN ADDITION TO AND SEPARATE FROM ANY PROXY OR VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL. IF YOU\nHOLD YOUR SHARES OF HANGER COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR\nNOMINEE AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR\nBANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE\nMAKING OF A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL BY SUCH BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE. IF YOU\nHAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF HANGER COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE\nNAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A NOMINEE OR INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY\nTO CAUSE THE HOLDER OF RECORD TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS\nNECESSARY TO DEMAND YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF HANGER\nCOMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK OR BROKERAGE FIRM WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE SHARES\nTHROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORY NOMINEE, SUCH AS THE DEPOSITORY TRUST\nCOMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF\nTHE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE HOLDER OF\nRECORD. IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITY OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, STOCKHOLDERS WHO MAY\nWISH TO PURSUE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD PROMPTLY CONSULT THEIR LEGAL AND FINANCIAL\nADVISORS.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 69)\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Hanger common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be\na taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder (as defined in\n\u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u202f-\u202fTax Consequences to U.S. Holders\u201d\non page 70 of this proxy statement) in exchange for such U.S. holder\u2019s shares of Hanger common stock in the\nMerger will generally result in the recognition of taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if\nany, between the cash such U.S. holder receives in the Merger (including any cash required to be withheld\nfor tax purposes) and such U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted basis in such surrendered shares. Gain or loss will be\ndetermined separately for each block of shares of Hanger common stock (that is, shares acquired for the\nsame cost in a single transaction). A non-U.S. holder (as defined in \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fU.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger\u202f-\u202fTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\u201d on page 71 of this proxy statement)\nwill generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Hanger common stock\nfor cash in the Merger unless such non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States or Hanger\nis, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation. Stockholders should refer to\n\u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d on page 69\n9 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof this proxy statement, and consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences\nrelating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws\nof any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 72)\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under the\nHart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), has expired or been\nterminated. In addition, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under\nWashington Revised Code 19.390.010, et. seq., a statute pertaining to certain health care transactions in the\nState of Washington, has expired. Hanger and Parent agreed to make the required filings as promptly as\npracticable after the date of the Merger Agreement. Hanger and Parent filed their respective pre-merger HSR\nAct notifications on August 2, 2022 with the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and the Antitrust\nDivision of the Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) under the HSR Act. Hanger submitted its HSR Act\nnotification form to the Washington Attorney General on August 2, 2022.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure\nyou that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the\ngranting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional\nconditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes\nto the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nNo Solicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Board Recommendation (page 83)\nExcept as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, we have agreed that we will, and will cause our\nsubsidiaries and instruct our representatives to, cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or\nnegotiations with any third party relating to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fNo Solicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Board Recommendation\u201d on page 83 of this proxy\nstatement), request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning Hanger and its\nsubsidiaries and cease providing any further information with respect to Hanger and its subsidiaries or any\nAcquisition Proposal to any such third party or its representatives.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, we have agreed that we will not, and will cause\nour subsidiaries and instruct our representatives not to, directly or indirectly:\nsolicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly\nencourage, facilitate or assist, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be\nexpected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal\u037e\nfurnish to any third party any non-public information relating to Hanger and its subsidiaries or afford\nto any third party access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public\ninformation, or to any personnel, of Hanger or its subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to\ninduce, or that could reasonably be expected to result in, the making, submission or announcement\nof, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the\nmaking of any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition\nProposal\u037e or\nparticipate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any third party with respect to an\nAcquisition Proposal.\nExcept as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, as described below, neither the Board nor any\ncommittee thereof will:\napprove or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal\u037e\nwithdraw, change or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board\nRecommendation\u037e\napprove or cause Hanger to enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent or other similar\nagreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal\u037e\n10 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfail to include the Company Board Recommendation in this proxy statement\u037e or\nresolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.\nWe refer to any event in the foregoing first, second, fourth or fifth bullets (to the extent related to one of the\nfirst two bullets) as a \u201cChange of Board Recommendation.\u201d\nIf, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, we receive a bona fide written Acquisition\nProposal from a third party (other than as a result of a breach of the \u201cno solicitation\u201d provisions of the\nMerger Agreement) that the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith (after\nconsultation with and advice from its financial advisors and outside counsel) constitutes or could\nreasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fNo\nSolicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Board Recommendation\u201d on page 83 of this proxy statement),\nHanger may subject to the entry into, and solely in accordance with, a confidentiality agreement that\ncontains confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Hanger than its\nconfidentiality agreement with Patient Square, furnish to such third party and its representatives any non-\npublic information relating to Hanger or its subsidiaries or afford to such third party and its representatives\naccess to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any\npersonnel, of Hanger or its subsidiaries and participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with such\nthird party and its representatives and otherwise facilitate or assist such third party and its representatives\nmaking such Acquisition Proposal. Hanger must provide to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public\ninformation that is provided to any third party and its representatives given such access that was not\npreviously made available to Parent or Merger Sub as promptly as reasonably practicable after it is provided\nor made available to such third party.\nThe Board may effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or\nterminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, only if it has provided Parent at least five\ndays\u2019 prior written notice of Hanger\u2019s intention to take such action and (i) during the five days, if requested\nby Parent, Hanger has engaged in good faith negotiations regarding any amendment to the Merger\nAgreement and (ii) the Board will have considered in good faith any adjustments and/or proposed\namendments to the Merger Agreement and will have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal\nwould continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the proposed amendments to the Merger Agreement were\nto be given effect (as described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fNo Solicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of\nBoard Recommendation\u201d on page 83 of this proxy statement). The Board (or any duly authorized committee\nthereof) will not be permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement for a Superior Proposal unless Hanger pays\nthe termination fee described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fees\u201d on page 97 of this proxy\nstatement.\nAt any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board may effect a Change of Board\nRecommendation if the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines, in good faith, after\nconsultation with outside counsel, that an Intervening Event (as defined in \u201cThe Merger Agreement - No\nSolicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Board Recommendation\u201d on page 83 of this proxy statement) has\noccurred and is continuing, and that the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to\nsuch Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under\napplicable law, subject to compliance with certain notice and other requirements as set forth in the Merger\nAgreement (see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fNo Solicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Board\nRecommendation\u201d on page 83 of this proxy statement).\nFor a further discussion of the limitations on solicitation of Acquisition Proposals from third parties and the\nBoard\u2019s ability to make a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger Proposal, see \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u202f-\u202fNo Solicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Board Recommendation\u201d on page 83 of this\nproxy statement.\nConditions to the Closing of the Merger (page 93)\nThe parties expect to complete the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, it is possible that factors\noutside of each party\u2019s control could require them to complete the Merger at a later time or not to complete it\nat all.

        "Background of the Merger": {
            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger\nAgreement. The following chronology does not purport to catalogue every communication among the\nBoard, representatives of Hanger and other parties.\nIn the ordinary course, the Board and Hanger management periodically review and assess Hanger\u2019s results\nof operations, financial position, business strategy and growth opportunities, as well as the trends and\nconditions affecting Hanger\u2019s industry and business generally. Such assessments include periodic meetings\nor consultations with third-party advisors, as well as consideration of potential strategic and financial\nalternatives to maximize stockholder value, including acquisitions and financing transactions. At regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, in connection with the Board\u2019s evaluation of Hanger\u2019s business strategy\nand growth opportunities, Hanger\u2019s management routinely updates the Board on Hanger\u2019s recent activities\nand reviews strategic opportunities and challenges for Hanger in light of current market conditions and\ntrends. Hanger\u2019s management and certain members of the Board also engage in general discussions from\ntime to time with various parties, including strategic parties and financial sponsors, as well as financing\nsources, market participants and investment banking firms, regarding Hanger\u2019s business, strategy and\ngrowth opportunities, including opportunities for collaboration, potential business combinations,\nacquisitions and financing transactions. Among numerous other discussions with financial sponsors and\nfinancing sources, a general discussion occurred in December 2021 between Vinit K. Asar, the President and\nChief Executive Officer of Hanger, and a principal of Patient Square. In addition, BofA Securities, Inc. (\u201cBofA\nSecurities\u201d), Hanger\u2019s longstanding investment banking advisor, has from time to time made presentations\nto the Board regarding matters such as market conditions and trends and financing alternatives.\nAt a regularly scheduled Board meeting held by video conference on February 16, 2022, Hanger management\nupdated the Board regarding, among other matters, the inflationary environment, including resulting key risk\nareas such as the impacts of inflation on material and labor costs. Hanger management also reviewed for the\nBoard fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results with comparisons to 2020 results, as well as against\nHanger\u2019s budget for 2022, including assumptions regarding inflation and labor costs. Also during the\nmeeting, at the request of Hanger management, which was discussed in advance with Hanger\u2019s independent\nChairman of the Board, representatives of BofA Securities reviewed Hanger\u2019s recent stock price performance\nand market benchmarking, noting that Hanger\u2019s stock price performance had been negatively impacted\nrelative to its peers due to sales volume, margin, productivity and supply chain issues exacerbated by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic that resulted in downward impacts on Hanger\u2019s revenues and earnings. BofA Securities\nalso discussed with the Board certain strategic alternatives for Hanger, including executing on its current\nstrategic business plan and exploring a sale of Hanger as a potential means to realize value with greater\ncertainty, with rationales for and considerations regarding both alternatives. BofA Securities also discussed\nan illustrative process for exploring a potential sale of Hanger, should the Board determine to initiate such a\nprocess. Hanger\u2019s outside legal advisors, Foley & Lardner LLP (\u201cFoley\u201d), provided an overview of the\nBoard\u2019s fiduciary duties in connection with the review of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale\ntransaction, and legal matters related to the potential process described by BofA Securities. The Board did\nnot make a determination to conduct a further evaluation of potential strategic alternatives at that time.\nOn February 25, 2022, the independent directors on the Board held a video conference without Hanger\nmanagement or advisors present to further discuss the matters reviewed at the February 16, 2022 Board\nmeeting.\nAt a special Board meeting held by video conference on March 18, 2022, Hanger management reviewed with\nthe Board a comparison of Hanger\u2019s long range forecast previously presented to the Board in August 2021\nto an updated five-year forecast prepared by Hanger management. The five-year forecast prepared by\nHanger management (as updated) and reviewed with the Board is referred to in this proxy\n32 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nstatement as the \u201cManagement Forecast\u201d, as discussed under \u201c- Certain Financial Projections\u201d in this\nproxy statement. Since the time of the development of the long range forecast, Hanger\u2019s results for 2021 were\nsignificantly affected by the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19, as well as other factors, and results\nfor 2021 were lower than had been forecasted in the long range plan forecast. Hanger management\nincorporated actual 2021 performance into the Management Forecast. Additionally, Hanger had prepared its\nbudget for 2022 beginning in the fall of 2021, and that process had enabled Hanger management to\nincorporate into the Management Forecast updated information regarding Hanger\u2019s business trends,\nparticularly with respect to reimbursements and inflation. At the request of the Board, representatives of\nBofA Securities reviewed Hanger\u2019s recent stock price performance, market benchmarking, the Management\nForecast and certain illustrative valuation metrics for Hanger. BofA Securities again reviewed with the Board,\nand the Board discussed, certain strategic alternatives for Hanger. BofA Securities also discussed in detail a\nproposed process and timeline for exploring a potential sale of Hanger. BofA Securities reviewed with the\nBoard a range of potential buyers to be approached in the process. In addition, BofA Securities and members\nof Hanger management discussed with the Board the likelihood that any strategic buyers would have both\nthe financial wherewithal and interest to acquire Hanger and the risks to Hanger of sharing confidential\ninformation with potential strategic buyers before an agreed transaction was in place. As part of such\ndiscussions, representatives of Foley discussed certain matters relating to the proposed process and\nreminded the Board of its fiduciary duties in connection with the review of strategic alternatives, including a\npotential sale transaction. Based on these discussions, the Board determined that only potential financial\nsponsor buyers would be included in the process at this stage. After discussion by the Board of the\nproposed sale process (the \u201cSale Transaction Process\u201d), the directors present unanimously determined to\ncommence the Sale Transaction Process, and directed Hanger management and BofA Securities to undertake\nthe initial steps thereof. Hanger management also reviewed with the Board the key terms of a proposed\nengagement letter with BofA Securities, noting that the terms had been reviewed by both management and\nFoley. In light of BofA Securities\u2019 qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of Hanger\u2019s business\nand industry, the directors present unanimously authorized Hanger management to execute the engagement\nletter with BofA Securities on substantially the terms presented.\nDuring the months of March and April 2022, Hanger management and its advisors prepared for the Sale\nTransaction Process, including by preparing a presentation for distribution to potential bidders (the \u201cHanger\npresentation\u201d) that included the Management Forecast that was reviewed with the Board at the March 2022\nmeeting, documents to be uploaded to the virtual data room, and a form of confidentiality agreement to be\nfurnished to potential bidders.\nBeginning on March 31, 2022, BofA Securities initiated discussions with 14 potentially interested parties, all\nof which were financial sponsors, regarding whether such parties would have an interest in exploring a\ntransaction with Hanger. Patient Square and Bidders A through I (as defined below) were included in such\noutreach. These discussions were conducted only based upon publicly available information given the\nparties had not yet entered into confidentiality agreements. Following this initial outreach, Hanger entered\ninto confidentiality agreements with 12 potentially interested parties. Patient Square entered into a\nconfidentiality agreement with Hanger on April 11, 2022. Each party that entered into a confidentiality\nagreement received certain process materials from BofA Securities, including the Hanger presentation. The\nremaining two parties that did not enter into confidentiality agreements indicated they were not interested in\npursuing a transaction with Hanger for a variety of reasons.\nTwo of the potentially interested parties who entered into confidentiality agreements with Hanger and\nreceived process materials declined the opportunity to meet for a management presentation. During April\n2022, Hanger conducted management presentations with ten potentially interested parties who had\npreviously entered into confidentiality agreements with Hanger and received process materials, during which\nHanger management provided an overview of Hanger\u2019s business, results of operations, business strategies\nand growth opportunities. Three of such management presentations were held virtually and seven were held\nin person (or hybrid) at BofA Securities\u2019 offices in New York, New York.\nOn April 12, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor party (\u201cBidder A\u201d) participated in a Hanger\nmanagement presentation meeting. Following this meeting, BofA Securities had a follow-up telephone\nconversation with Bidder A. Bidder A ultimately declined to proceed in the process.\n33 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn April 12, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor party (\u201cBidder B\u201d) participated in a Hanger\nmanagement presentation meeting.

On May 4, 2022, BofA Securities\ndistributed to Patient Square, Bidder C, Bidder D, Bidder E, Bidder F, Bidder G and Bidder H supplemental\nmaterials regarding Hanger\u2019s first quarter of 2022 financial results.\nOn May 12, 2022, Patient Square was the only potentially interested party to submit a non-binding initial\nindication of interest to acquire Hanger. Patient Square proposed an all-cash purchase price of $18.50 per\nshare, subject to customary conditions, including completing due diligence. In addition, the indications of\ninterest indicated Patient Square intended to finance the merger consideration with a combination of third-\nparty debt and equity capital from its own managed funds and that debt financing would not be a condition\nto closing. Patient Square also noted its ability to move quickly and that it expected that it could complete its\ndue diligence and sign definitive transaction documentation in approximately four weeks. No other bidders\nsubmitted an indication of interest.\nOn May 16, 2022, during a Board update call held by video conference, BofA Securities reviewed with the\nBoard the status of the Sale Transaction Process, including that outreach had been made to 14 potentially\ninterested parties, with 12 parties expressing interest in evaluating the opportunity, signing a confidentiality\nagreement and receiving a presentation and the Management Forecast, and ten parties receiving an\n34 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexecutive presentation with Hanger management. BofA Securities discussed with the Board that as the\ndeadline to submit non-binding initial indications of interest approached, market conditions had deteriorated\nsignificantly with heightened volatility, broad risk-off investor mentality, rising interest rates, constraints\naround availability of financing, growing inflationary pressures, and contraction of valuation multiples. BofA\nSecurities also noted that a majority of the potential bidders communicated that they were unable to\nunderwrite the Hanger growth and multiple expansion required to generate expected returns. BofA Securities\nreviewed with the Board the terms of the non-binding indication of interest received from Patient Square. A\nrepresentative of Foley discussed with the Board certain matters relating to the process conducted,\nincluding fiduciary duty considerations relating to any decision to continue the process. The Board did not\nmake a decision during the call as to whether to continue with the Sale Transaction Process.\nAt a regularly scheduled Board meeting held by video conference on May 19, 2022, representatives of BofA\nSecurities reviewed with the Board Hanger\u2019s recent stock price performance, macroeconomic factors driving\nthe equity markets, and valuation benchmarking for Hanger. BofA Securities also discussed with the Board\ncertain illustrative valuation metrics based on the Management Forecast previously provided to the Board,\nand also discussed challenges for Hanger in light of current market conditions and trends and their impact\non potential bidders in the process. The Board then met in executive session with only Foley present and\ndeliberated whether to continue the Sale Transaction Process or to terminate it, including a discussion of\nreasons for and against both strategic alternatives. Upon completion of the discussion, the Board\nunanimously supported continuing with the next steps of the Sale Transaction Process and directed\nmanagement to instruct BofA Securities to advise Patient Square that Patient Square would need to increase\nits per share offer price for Hanger to be in the \u201ctwenties\u201d for Patient Square to continue in the process.\nOn May 19, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities had telephone conversations with representatives of\nPatient Square to communicate that the proposed price of $18.50 per share was inadequate and that Patient\nSquare would need to increase its per share offer price to be in the \u201ctwenties\u201d for Patient Square to continue\nin the process. Later that day, Patient Square submitted to BofA Securities a revised non-binding indication\nof interest stating that it saw a path to $20.00 per share, subject to validation of certain assumptions that\nrequired access to Hanger management and an in-depth review of Hanger financial and business information\nto validate. Subsequently, on May 25, 2022, Patient Square received access to a virtual data room of certain\nlimited business and financial information.\nOn May 25, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor party (\u201cBidder J\u201d) contacted BofA Securities\nexpressing interest in Hanger and noting they had done outside due diligence work. On May 26, 2022, Bidder\nJ entered into a confidentiality agreement and was provided with certain process materials from BofA\nSecurities, including the presentation that included the Management Forecast.\nOn May 27, 2022, representatives of Patient Square and Hanger management held a phone call during which\nPatient Square conducted financial and business due diligence, including a review of the Management\nForecast. Thereafter and into June 2022, Patient Square performed business and operating due diligence. On\nJune 7, 2022, representatives of Patient Square attended a full day management presentation at Hanger\u2019s\nheadquarters in Austin, Texas.\nOn June 10, 2022, Bidder J had a virtual meeting with Hanger management. Bidder J ultimately declined to\nproceed in the process.\nOn June 14, 2022, representatives of Patient Square held a due diligence call with Hanger management on the\nManagement Forecast and cost structure matters.\nOn June 17, 2022, on a regularly scheduled monthly Board update video conference, Hanger management\nupdated the Board on the status of the Sale Transaction Process to explore a potential sale of Hanger.\nOn June 19, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities held a telephone conversation with representatives of\nPatient Square regarding the Sale Transaction Process.\nOn June 20, 2022, Patient Square submitted a letter to BofA Securities indicating that its time spent with\nHanger management and access to Hanger information helped provide confidence to allow it to pay the price\nof $20.00 per share to which it saw a path in its May 19, 2022 indication of interest, but that in the\n35 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nintervening time the debt financing markets had moved materially, reducing the aggregate amount of debt\nthat could be raised and increasing interest rates and debt issuance costs, resulting in lower expected\nreturns on equity. As a result, Patient Square reaffirmed its initial valuation of $18.50 per share and noted it\ndid not have additional flexibility to move on valuation. Patient Square also noted it anticipated completing\nremaining confirmatory due diligence and could sign definitive transaction documentation in the next three\nweeks.\nOn June 23, 2022, the Board held an update call by video conference to discuss the letter received from\nPatient Square. Representatives of BofA Securities reviewed with the Board that since the May 19, 2022\nBoard meeting, capital markets conditions had continued to deteriorate and debt financing had become\nincreasingly more conservative from a leverage multiple standpoint and expensive from the cost of debt and\noriginal issue discount standpoint. Representatives of BofA Securities then reviewed updates to its principal\nvaluation assumptions since the May 19, 2022 Board presentation due to the change in market conditions\nand updated illustrative valuation metrics, including selected publicly traded companies, selected precedent\ntransactions and discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Management Forecast previously provided to\nthe Board, which remained unchanged. A representative of Foley discussed with the Board certain fiduciary\nduty matters relating to the Sale Transaction Process, including the desire of the Board to include a \u201cgo-\nshop\u201d period to allow Hanger to solicit proposals after signing of any merger agreement if the Board\ndetermined to continue such process. After deliberation, the Board directed BofA Securities to advise Patient\nSquare that Patient Square would need to increase its per share offer price for Hanger to $19.25.\nOn June 23 and 24, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities had telephone conversations with\nrepresentatives of Patient Square to communicate that the proposed price of $18.50 per share was inadequate\nand that Patient Square would need to increase its per share offer price to $19.25. As a result of such\ndiscussions Patient Square orally conveyed to BofA Securities that it was able to improve the proposed price\nto $18.75 per share, but that was Patient Square\u2019s best and final offer.\nOn June 25, 2022, the Board held an update call by video conference to discuss the most recent offer\nreceived from Patient Square. The call began with an executive session of the Board with a representative of\nFoley reviewing with the Board certain legal matters relating to the Sale Transaction Process to explore a\npotential sale of Hanger, as well as fiduciary duty considerations. Representatives of BofA Securities then\njoined the call and reviewed the discussions that had occurred with representatives of Patient Square\nresulting in the offer of $18.75 per share. BofA Securities was then excused from the meeting and the Board\nengaged in an extended discussion of whether to continue the Sale Transaction Process with Patient Square\nat the offered price or to terminate the process, including a discussion of reasons for and against both\nstrategic alternatives. Upon completion of the discussion, the Board unanimously supported continuing with\nthe next steps of the Sale Transaction Process, including proceeding with making additional information\navailable to Patient Square for due diligence and providing to Patient Square an auction draft of a form\nmerger agreement, the key terms of which from a fiduciary duty perspective representatives of Foley had\ndiscussed with the Board, and directed management to instruct BofA Securities to obtain a confirmation of\nPatient Square\u2019s offer of $18.75 per share in writing.\nOn June 25, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities requested and obtained from Patient Square a letter\nconfirming Patient Square\u2019s updated indication of interest price of $18.75 per share. Patient Square and its\nadvisors were subsequently provided access to a full virtual data room of information for due diligence\npurposes and a process letter indicating final bids were due on July 19, 2022, with markups of the draft form\nof merger agreement and other transaction documents due in advance.\nBeginning on June 27, 2022 and into July 2022, Hanger and its advisors engaged in an extensive financial,\nlegal and regulatory due diligence process with Patient Square and its advisors, including numerous\nconference calls on due diligence matters.\nOn June 28, 2022, Patient Square and its transaction legal counsel, Greenberg Traurig, LLP (\u201cGreenberg\u201d),\nwere provided auction drafts of a form Merger Agreement and a form Limited Guaranty. Among other terms,\nthe draft Merger Agreement included a 45-day \u201cgo-shop\u201d period to allow Hanger to solicit proposals after\nsigning the proposed Merger Agreement with Patient Square, a \u201ctwo-tiered\u201d Hanger termination fee with a\nlower termination fee of 1.0% of Hanger\u2019s equity value payable if the Merger Agreement was terminated by\nHanger to accept a superior proposal during the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period (as well as\n36 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nafter the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period for certain exempted persons who approached Hanger during the \u201cgo-shop\u201d\nperiod) and a termination fee of 3.0% of Hanger\u2019s equity value after the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period. The draft Merger\nAgreement also contemplated that Parent, Hanger and their respective affiliates would be required to divest\nassets, pursue litigation and take certain other actions, if necessary, to obtain antirust and other regulatory\napprovals (a so-called \u201chell or high water\u201d regulatory approvals provision). In addition, the draft Merger\nAgreement provided that Parent would be obligated to pay a reverse termination fee of 10.0% of the equity\nvalue of Hanger if the Merger Agreement was terminated due to Parent\u2019s failure to consummate the Merger\nwhen required to do so under the Merger Agreement, due to a willful and material breach of the merger\nagreement by Parent or due to a failure of Parent to obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals.\nOn July 6 and 8, 2022, representatives of Patient Square held due diligence calls with Hanger management\nregarding clinician employment, labor and other costs, reimbursement and payor dynamics and other Hanger\nbusiness trends.\nOn July 7, 2022, Foley made available to Greenberg an initial draft of the Disclosure Schedule to the Merger\nAgreement. Subsequently, Foley sent Greenberg updated drafts of such Disclosure Schedule on which\nGreenberg commented.\nOn July 8, 2022, Greenberg sent Foley revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Limited Guaranty and\nan initial draft of the Equity Commitment Letter. The revised draft of the Merger Agreement removed the \u201cgo-\nshop\u201d provision, replaced the \u201ctwo-tiered\u201d structure for Hanger\u2019s termination fee with a \u201csingle-tier\u201d\nstructure and proposed a termination fee of $30 million (approximately 3.9% of Hanger\u2019s equity value), added\na provision that if the Merger Agreement was terminated for failure to obtain the Company Stockholder\nApproval Hanger must reimburse Parent for its transaction fees and expenses, stated that the \u201chell or high\nwater\u201d regulatory efforts provision was subject to due diligence, proposed a Parent reverse termination fee\nof $36 million (approximately 4.7% of Hanger\u2019s equity value), and deleted triggers for payment of a Parent\nreverse termination fee for willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement and failure to obtain\nregulatory approvals.\nOn July 11, 2022, Foley had a telephone call with Greenberg to provide high-level feedback on the issues\npresented by Greenberg\u2019s comments to the draft Merger Agreement. These issues included, among other\nthings: (i) the Board\u2019s desire to include a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) the size and\nstructure of the Hanger termination fee\u037e (iii) that Hanger would not agree to expense reimbursement for a\nfailure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval\u037e (iv) the level of Parent\u2019s efforts to obtain regulatory\napprovals\u037e and (v) the size of and triggers for the Parent reverse termination fee.\nOn July 11 and July 12, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities had telephone calls with representatives of\nPatient Square to also discuss the Board\u2019s desire to include a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in the Merger Agreement\nand the expected \u201chell or high water\u201d efforts to obtain regulatory approvals. During such calls,\nrepresentatives of Patient Square expressed that Patient Square would not be willing to execute a Merger\nAgreement that contained a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision.\nOn July 12, 2022, representatives of Patient Square met with Hanger\u2019s management team for a half-day\nmeeting at Hanger\u2019s headquarters in Austin, Texas for purposes of continuing due diligence as well as to\ndiscuss with Hanger\u2019s management Patient Square\u2019s plans for Hanger. During such discussion, Patient\nSquare had an introductory discussion with certain members of Hanger\u2019s management team in which it\nindicated that it may provide for an equity pool of up to approximately 12% of the equity of Parent or one or\nmore of its affiliates for the granting of new equity awards to Hanger employees after the closing of the\nMerger, as described in \u201c- Interests of the Directors and Officers of Hanger in the Merger\u202f-\u202fCompensation\nArrangements with Parent\u201d.\nOn July 12, 2022, Foley sent Greenberg revised drafts of the Merger Agreement, the Limited Guaranty and the\nEquity Commitment Letter for review and consideration prior to Greenberg submitting a revised draft of the\nMerger Agreement in advance of the July 15, 2022 Board call to review terms of the draft Merger Agreement.\nThe revised draft of the Merger Agreement reinserted the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision and a \u201ctwo-tiered\u201d Hanger\ntermination fee of $7.7 million (approximately 1.0% of Hanger\u2019s equity value) if the Merger Agreement was\nterminated by Hanger to accept a superior proposal during the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period and a\n37 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntermination fee of $23 million (approximately 3.0% of Hanger\u2019s equity value) after the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period and\ndeleted the provision requiring Hanger to reimburse Parent for its transaction fees and expenses if the\nMerger Agreement was terminated for failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The revised draft\ncontinued to include \u201chell or high water\u201d regulatory efforts provision, increased the Parent reverse\ntermination fee to $56 million (approximately 7.3% of Hanger equity value) and reinserted the triggers for\npayment of a Parent reverse termination fee for willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement and\nfailure to obtain regulatory approvals.\nOn July 13, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities had a telephone call with representatives of Patient\nSquare to again discuss the Board\u2019s desire to include a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in the Merger Agreement and\nthe expected \u201chell or high water\u201d efforts to obtain regulatory approvals. During such call, representatives of\nPatient Square reiterated their position that Patient Square would not be willing to execute a Merger\nAgreement that contained a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision, but expected that they could include the \u201chell or high\nwater\u201d regulatory efforts provision in the Merger Agreement.\nOn July 14, 2022, Greenberg had a telephone call with Foley to provide feedback on the open material issues\nin the draft Merger Agreement. Among other items, Greenberg noted with respect to the request for a \u201cgo-\nshop\u201d provision that the \u201cno solicitation\u201d provisions of the Merger Agreement contained customary\n\u201cfiduciary out\u201d provisions and that they expected to include the \u201chell or high water\u201d regulatory efforts\nprovision in the Merger Agreement with some qualifications. The size of both the Hanger termination fee and\nthe Parent reverse termination fee were also discussed, along with the triggers for the Parent reverse\ntermination fee. Greenberg also raised the desire of Patient Square to obtain consents and renewals with\nrespect to certain third party contracts as a closing condition.\nOn July 14, 2022, Greenberg sent Foley a revised draft of the Merger Agreement that again removed the \u201cgo-\nshop\u201d provision but lowered Hanger\u2019s termination fee from Patient Square\u2019s prior position to $28 million\n(approximately 3.6% of Hanger\u2019s equity value) and did not include a provision for Hanger reimbursement of\nParent\u2019s transaction fees and expenses if the Merger Agreement was terminated for failure to obtain the\nCompany Stockholder Approval. The revised draft also included the \u201chell or high water\u201d regulatory efforts\nprovision subject to certain qualifications and deleted the Parent reverse termination fee for failure to obtain\nregulatory approvals. In addition, the revised draft increased the Parent reverse termination fee from Patient\nSquare\u2019s prior position to $39 million (approximately 5.0% of Hanger\u2019s equity value), and deleted the trigger\nfor payment of a Parent reverse termination fee for willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement, but\ninstead permitted that in such a situation Hanger has a damages remedy capped at $45 million.\nOn July 15, 2022, on a regularly scheduled monthly Board update video conference, representatives of Foley\nand BofA Securities reviewed with the Board the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the material open\nitems. With respect to the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision, Foley discussed that such a provision was not required\nunder Delaware law given 15 potentially interested parties had been engaged during the Sale Transaction\nProcess and that the Merger Agreement\u2019s \u201cno solicitation\u201d provisions contained customary \u201cfiduciary out\u201d\nprovisions that would permit the Board to consider acquisition proposals from third parties, including from\nany potential strategic buyers, if they constituted or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior\nProposal. BofA Securities also discussed with the Board the likelihood that other financial sponsor bidders\nwould have different views regarding Hanger than those expressed by potential bidders in the Sale\nTransaction Process. Foley discussed that in exchange for eliminating the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision, Hanger\ncould request a two-tiered termination fee of $10 million (approximately 1.3% of Hanger equity value) for the\nfirst 45 days after signing of the Merger Agreement and $25 million (approximately 3.3% of Hanger equity\nvalue) thereafter. Foley discussed continuing to include the \u201chell or high water\u201d regulatory efforts provision\nin the Merger Agreement without qualification in exchange for eliminating the Parent reverse termination fee\nfor failure to obtain regulatory approval. With respect to the Parent reverse termination fee and damages cap,\nFoley discussed pursuing a reverse termination fee of $50 million (approximately 6.5% of Hanger equity\nvalue) and a damages cap for willful and material breaches by Parent of $55 million. As part of the discussion\non sizes of both the Hanger termination fee and Parent reverse termination fee, Foley reviewed with the\nBoard data as to the historical median percentages of equity value for such fees. Foley also discussed with\nthe Board that while the Merger Agreement generally provided for limited conditions to closing, including\nthat the condition for accuracy of representations was generally subject to a Company\n38 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMaterial Adverse Effect standard, the request by Patient Square for a closing condition relating to consents\nand renewal with respect to certain third party contracts created transaction closing uncertainty, and that\nthis proposed closing condition should be deleted. The Board instructed Foley to revise the Merger\nAgreement consistent with the foregoing.\nOn July 15, 2022, Foley had a call with Greenberg to discuss the results of the discussion with the Board on\nthe foregoing merger agreement terms and sent Greenberg a revised draft of the Merger Agreement\nconsistent with Foley\u2019s instructions from the Board. Also on July 15, 2022, Greenberg sent Foley revised\ndrafts of the Limited Guaranty and Equity Commitment Letter, which Greenberg and Foley subsequently\nfinalized.\nOn July 16, 2022, Greenberg sent Foley a revised draft of the Merger Agreement that deleted the two-tiered\nHanger termination fee but lowered Hanger\u2019s termination fee from Patient Square\u2019s prior position to $23\nmillion (approximately 3.0% of Hanger\u2019s equity value). The revised draft also included the \u201chell or high\nwater\u201d regulatory efforts provision without qualification. In addition, the revised draft increased the Parent\nreverse termination fee from Patient Square\u2019s prior position to $45 million (approximately 5.9% of Hanger\u2019s\nequity value) and increased the damages cap for a willful and material breach by Parent to $50 million. The\nrevised draft also noted the potential closing condition to obtain consents and renewals with respect to\ncertain third party contracts would be the subject of a discussion between Hanger management and Patient\nSquare.\nOn July 17, 2022, Foley sent Greenberg a revised draft of the Merger Agreement in an effort to resolve minor\nopen issues, but reserved comment on open issues that had been the subject of the July 15, 2022 Board call\npending further discussion with the Board on those items.\nOn July 18, 2022, Hanger management and representatives of Patient Square held a call to review Hanger\u2019s\npreliminary financial results for the second quarter of 2022 and various matters regarding a proposed Merger,\nincluding the potential closing condition regarding consents and renewals with respect to certain third party\ncontracts, which Patient Square agreed was not necessary. During such call, Patient Square had an\nintroductory discussion with certain members of Hanger\u2019s management team in which it indicated that it\nexpects members of Hanger\u2019s management team to use a portion of the proceeds they receive from the\nMerger to purchase equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates, on customary terms, as described in \u201c-\nInterests of the Directors and Officers of Hanger in the Merger\u202f-\u202fCompensation Arrangements with Parent\u201d.\nOn July 18, 2022, Foley and Greenberg held a call to discuss various items to finalize the draft Merger\nAgreement and other transactions documents.\nOn July 18, 2022, Greenberg sent Foley a revised draft of the Disclosure Schedules to the Merger Agreement.\nOn July 19, 2022, Hanger management and representatives of Patient Square held a call to review the\nManagement Forecast.\nOn July 19, 2022, Greenberg submitted to Foley as Patient Square\u2019s final bid documentation, a revised draft\nof the Merger Agreement, which included the $18.75 per share Merger Consideration, revised drafts of the\nEquity Commitment Letter and Limited Guaranty, a draft of the Debt Commitment Letter and the revised draft\nof the Disclosure Schedules to the Merger Agreement.\nOn July 19, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by video conference, together with Hanger\u2019s management\nand financial and legal advisors, to review Patient Square\u2019s final proposal, including the terms of the\nproposed Merger Agreement. Foley reviewed the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in connection with the Board\u2019s\nprocess to review strategic alternatives, including in connection with a potential sale transaction. BofA\nSecurities reviewed a summary of the Sale Transaction Process and summarized key financial and other terms\nof Patient Square\u2019s bid, which included an all-cash offer at a price of $18.75 per share, including the implied\npremiums and multiples that such price represented. BofA Securities also discussed selected terms of the\nmerger agreement. BofA Securities then reviewed Hanger\u2019s stock price performance, market benchmarking for\nHanger, and updates to BofA Securities\u2019 financial analysis and related assumptions since the June 23, 2022\nBoard presentation. Hanger management also discussed with the Board Hanger\u2019s\n39",

The Board carefully reviewed and considered\na number of factors, including the following factors (which are not necessarily listed in order of relative\nimportance), all of which it viewed as generally supporting its unanimous (i) determination and declaration\nthat the Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to which Hanger is a party and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby,

Rather,\nthis analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies,\nbusiness segments or transactions to which Hanger and the Merger were compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis.\nBofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Hanger to calculate the estimated present\nvalue of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Hanger was forecasted to generate during\nHanger\u2019s fiscal year 2022 (second through fourth quarters) through fiscal year 2026 based on the\nManagement Forecasts. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for Hanger by applying terminal forward\nmultiples of 8.5x to 10.5x, based on the historical trading range for the Hanger stock as a multiple of Adjusted\nEBITDA, to the terminal year Adjusted EBITDA. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to\npresent value as of March 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 7.75% to 9.25%, which were based on\nan estimate of Hanger\u2019s weighted average cost of capital.

The preparation of a financial opinion is a\ncomplex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant\nmethods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and,\ntherefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA\nSecurities believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities\nfurther believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information\npresented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the\nanalyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities\u2019\nanalyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not\nmeant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the\nsummary.\n50 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic\nconditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Hanger. The estimates of the future\nperformance of Hanger in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual\nvalues or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or\nthose suggested by BofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA\nSecurities\u2019 analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration and were\nprovided to the Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The analyses do not\npurport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at\nwhich any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in,\nand the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are inherently subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities\u2019 view of the actual values of Hanger.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between\nHanger and Parent, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board. The decision to\nenter into the Merger agreement was solely that of the Board. As described above, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion\nand analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the proposed\nMerger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or Hanger\u2019s management with\nrespect to the Merger or the Merger Consideration.\nHanger has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee of\napproximately $14 million, $1 million of which was payable upon the delivery of its opinion and the remaining\nportion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. Hanger also has agreed to reimburse\nBofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify\nBofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers,\nemployees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities\nlaws.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in\nsecurities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and\nprincipal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment\nmanagement, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide\nrange of companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA\nSecurities and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that\ninvest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in\nequity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other\nobligations) of (i) Hanger and certain of its affiliates, and (ii) Parent and certain of its affiliates, including\nPatient Square and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may\nprovide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Hanger and certain of its\naffiliates and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services,\nincluding (i) having acted or acting as an administrative agent, collateral agent, arranger, book-running\nmanager and/or bookrunner for, and/or as a lender under, certain letters of credit, credit and leasing facilities\nand other credit arrangements of Hanger and/or certain of its affiliates, (ii) having provided or providing\ncertain foreign exchange trading services to Hanger and/or certain of its affiliates, and (iii) having provided\nor providing certain treasury management products and services to Hanger and/or certain of its affiliates.\nFrom July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2022, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from\nHanger and certain of its affiliates of approximately $6 million for investment and corporate banking services.\nIn addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the\nfuture may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Parent and\ncertain of its affiliates, including Patient Square and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies, and have\nreceived or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having\nacted or acting as an arranger and/or bookrunner for, and/or as a lender under, certain term loans, credit\nfacilities and other credit arrangements of Parent and/or certain of its affiliates, including Patient Square\nCapital and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies (including acquisition financing), and (ii)\nhaving provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Parent and/or certain of\nits\n51",

            "text": "Certain Financial Projections\nExcept for a financial outlook with respect to the current fiscal year issued in connection with its ordinary\ncourse earnings announcements, Hanger does not normally publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to\nfuture performance, earnings or other results due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying\nassumptions, estimates and projections, especially over the longer-term periods. In connection with the\nevaluation of the Merger, Hanger\u2019s management prepared and provided to the Board and BofA Securities the\nManagement Forecasts. Hanger is including a summary of the Management Forecasts to provide Company\nstockholders with access to information that was made available to the Board in connection with its\nevaluation of the Merger and the Merger Consideration. In addition, a summary of the Management\nForecasts was made available to Parent and Merger Sub at Parent\u2019s request in connection with their due\ndiligence review of Hanger. The Management Forecasts were also made available to BofA Securities in\nconnection with the rendering of its financial fairness opinion to the Board, as more fully described in\n\u201c-\u200bFairness Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.\u201d The summary of the Management Forecasts may not be\nappropriate for other purposes and is not being included in this proxy statement to influence a Company\nstockholder\u2019s decision whether to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal or any other proposal. Please read\nthe information set forth in this section below under the heading \u201cImportant Information Regarding the\nManagement Forecasts.\u201d\nThe following table presents a summary of the Management Forecasts.\nYear ended December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\nNet Revenue\n$ 981\n$1,315\n$1,389\n$1,465\n$1,543\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 129\n$ 149\n$ 165\n$\n180\n$\n195\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow\n$\n37\n$\n27\n$\n34\n$\n47\n$\n59\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as operating income before\ndepreciation and amortization, and adjusted to exclude expenses associated with stock based\ncompensation, severance expenses, certain expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions\n(including the Merger and the Merger Agreement) and certain other charges.\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow, as derived from the Management Forecast, means (a) Adjusted EBITDA less\nstock based compensation, depreciation and amortization, all tax effected, plus (b) depreciation and\namortization, less (c) changes in net working capital, acquisition expenditures and capital expenditures.\nThe amounts presented for 2022 reflect the nine-month period ending December 31, 2022. All other years\npresented reflect full twelve-month periods.\nImportant Information Regarding the Management Forecasts\nThe Management Forecasts were developed by Hanger\u2019s management on a standalone basis without giving\neffect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the\nManagement Forecasts do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nAlthough the Management Forecasts are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous\nvariables and assumptions made by Hanger\u2019s management with respect to industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters\nspecific to Hanger\u2019s business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which\nare beyond Hanger\u2019s control. The Management Forecasts constitute forward-looking information and are\nsubject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results\nforecasted in the Management Forecasts, including, but not limited to, the\n52 \n(3)\n(1)\n(2)TABLE OF CONTENTS\nfactors set forth in \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the various risks\nset forth in Hanger\u2019s reports filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the Management Forecasts\nwill be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than the Management Forecasts.\nThe Management Forecasts cover several years, and such information by its nature becomes less reliable\nwith each successive year. In addition, the Management Forecasts will be affected by Hanger\u2019s ability to\nachieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Management Forecasts\nreflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and cannot, therefore, be\nconsidered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such. The\ninclusion of the Management Forecasts should not be regarded as an indication that Hanger, BofA\nSecurities, their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors, or other representatives or anyone who\nreceived this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable prediction of future events, and\nthis information should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management Forecasts in this proxy\nstatement should not be regarded as an indication that the Management Forecasts will be necessarily\npredictive of actual future events. No representation is made by Hanger or any other person regarding the\nManagement Forecasts or Hanger\u2019s ultimate performance compared to such information. The Management\nForecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other\ninformation about Hanger contained in Hanger\u2019s public filings with the SEC. For more information, please see\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d In light of the\nforegoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Forecasts, Company stockholders are\ncautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Forecasts.\nThe Management Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward\ncomplying with the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants with respect to the preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The\nManagement Forecasts included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility\nof, Hanger\u2019s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor\napplied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying Management Forecasts and, accordingly,\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect\nthereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference into this proxy statement relates\nto Hanger\u2019s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the Management Forecasts and\nshould not be read to do so.\nAdjusted EBITDA contained in the Management Forecasts and Unlevered Free Cash Flow derived\ntherefrom, both as summarized above, are each a \u201cnon-GAAP financial measure,\u201d which is a financial\nperformance measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures\nused in the Management Forecasts were relied upon by BofA Securities for purposes of its opinion and by\nthe Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a\nreconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP\nfinancial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger\nif the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-\nGAAP financial measures were not relied upon by BofA Securities for purposes of its opinion or by the\nBoard in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, Hanger has not provided a reconciliation\nof the financial measures included in the Management Forecasts to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial\ninformation presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Hanger may\nnot be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations\ninherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be\nincluded in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered\ntogether with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe summary of such information above is included solely to give Company stockholders access to the\ninformation that was made available to the Board, BofA Securities, Parent and Merger Sub, and is not\nincluded in this proxy statement to influence any Company stockholder to vote their shares of Hanger\ncommon stock in favor of the Merger Proposal or any other proposal contained herein. In addition, the\nManagement Forecasts have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date they\nwere prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities\n53 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nlaws, Hanger does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Management Forecasts or the specific\nportions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of\nfuture events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.",

            "text": "Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, you should\nbe aware that certain of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder generally. The Board was aware of these\ninterests in, among other matters, approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Proposal be adopted and approved by\nthe stockholders of Hanger. See \u201c- Background of the Merger\u201d and \u201c- Recommendation of Our Board of\nDirectors and Reasons for the Merger\u201d. You should take these interests into account in deciding whether to\nvote \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the Merger Proposal.\nThese interests are described in more detail below. For purposes of the discussion below, Vinit K. Asar,\nThomas E. Kiraly, Peter A. Stoy, Thomas E. Hartman, C. Scott Ranson, James H. Campbell, Mitchell D.\nDobson, Keri L. Jolly, and Gabrielle B. Adams are referred to as the \u201cexecutive officers.\u201d In certain instances,\nMessrs. Asar, Kiraly, Stoy, Hartman and Ranson are referred to as the \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d as they\nwere Hanger\u2019s chief executive officer, chief financial officer and the three other most highly compensated\nexecutive officers, respectively, as determined for purposes of Hanger\u2019s most recent annual proxy statement.\nCompensation that may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger is\nsubject to a non-binding, advisory vote of the stockholders of Hanger and is quantified in the narrative\nbelow and in \u201cProposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation\u201d. The\ndates used below to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only and do not\nnecessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will occur.\nTreatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the equity-based awards held by Hanger\u2019s directors and executive officers\nunder the Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Hanger, Inc. 2016 Omnibus\nIncentive Plan, the Hanger, Inc. 2017 Special Equity Plan, the Hanger, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, and\nthe Hanger, Inc. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (together, the \u201cEquity Incentive Plans\u201d), will not be continued\nfollowing the Merger and therefore will be cancelled and treated as explained below at the Effective Time.\nStock Options\nEach Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective\nTime will automatically be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount\nin cash (less any applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of\nHanger common stock underlying the Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger\nConsideration over the exercise price of such Company Option (less any taxes required to be withheld under\napplicable law). If the exercise price of a Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger\nConsideration, then such Company Option will be cancelled for no consideration.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nEach outstanding award of Company RSUs will become fully vested and will automatically be cancelled and\nconverted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less any applicable tax\nwithholdings) equal to (x) the total number of shares of Hanger common stock underlying such award of\nCompany RSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. Each outstanding award of Company PRSUs will\nbecome vested as to the number of shares of Hanger common stock subject to such award that would vest\nbased on target level achievement of all performance targets (without application of any modifier) and will,\nafter giving effect to such vesting, automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive\n(without interest) an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to (x) the number of\nvested shares of Hanger common stock underlying such award of Company PRSUs, multiplied by (y) the\nMerger Consideration, and the unvested portion of such Company PRSUs will be cancelled for no\nconsideration.\n54 (1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nEstimated Value of Accelerated Equity\nThe following table sets forth the number of unvested Company RSUs and unvested Company PRSUs that\nwere held by our executive officers and non-employee directors as of July 31, 2022 under our Equity\nIncentive Plans and the cash value that each executive officer and non-employee director will receive with\nrespect to these awards in connection with the Merger.\nName\nCompany\nRSUs\nCompany\nPRSUs\nTotal\nValue\nExecutive Officers\nVinit K.

Kiraly, Stoy, and Ranson\u037e 1.5 for Mr. Hartman and\nMs. Jolly\u037e 1.0 for Mr. Campbell and Mr. Dobson\u037e and 0.5 for Ms. Adams), (ii) reimbursement for COBRA\ncoverage and other employee benefits for a period of time following termination (30 months for Mr. Asar\u037e 24\nmonths for Messrs. Kiraly, Stoy and Ranson\u037e 18 months for Mr. Hartman and Ms. Jolly\u037e 12 months for Mr.\nCampbell and Mr. Dobson\u037e and six months for Ms. Adams), (iii) a pro-rata annual bonus for the year of\ntermination, if earned based on the achievement of the relevant goals, and (iv) outplacement services.\n55 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe foregoing amounts are in addition to the payment of all unpaid base salary to which the executive officer\nis entitled through the termination date and other vested benefits to which the executive officer is entitled\nunder Hanger\u2019s benefit plans and arrangements.\nThe employment agreements contain a \u201cSection 280G better-of\u201d provision, which provides that, if the total\ncompensation paid to an executive officer in connection with the Merger, which may include the severance\npayments described above, would exceed the applicable threshold under Section 280G of the Code, such that\nthe executive officer would be subject to an excise tax (and Hanger would forego a tax deduction) on a\nportion of those change in control payments, then those payments will either (i) be reduced to avoid the\nimposition of the excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code, or (ii) paid in full (resulting in the executive\nbecoming subject to the excise tax and resulting in a loss of a tax deduction for Hanger), whichever of (i) or\n(ii) results in a better after-tax result for the executive officer.\n\u201cCause\u201d is generally defined to mean (i) the repeated failure or refusal of the executive to follow the lawful\ndirectives of the Chief Executive Officer of Hanger or the Board (except due to sickness, injury or\ndisabilities), (ii) gross inattention to duty or any other willful, reckless or grossly negligent act (or omission\nto act) by the executive, which materially injures Hanger, including the repeated failure to follow the written\npolicies and procedures of Hanger, (iii) the executive\u2019s material breach of the employment agreement after\nwritten notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, if curable, or (iv) the commission by the executive of a\nfelony or other crime involving moral turpitude or an act of financial dishonesty against Hanger or any of its\naffiliates. Any determination of \u201ccause\u201d following a change in control (such as the Merger) can only be made\nby the Board or by the board of directors of the successor or acquirer in the change in control, which may\nterminate the executive for cause only after providing the executive (a) written notice that indicates in\nreasonable detail the facts and circumstances alleged to provide a basis for such termination, (b) a 30 day\nopportunity to cure such facts or circumstances, if curable, (c) the opportunity to appear before such board\n(with the accompaniment of counsel) and provide rebuttal to such proposed termination, and (d) written\nnotice following such appearance confirming such termination and certifying that the decision to terminate\nthe executive for cause was approved in good faith by at least 66% of the members of such board.\n\u201cGood Reason\u201d is generally defined to mean (i) a material diminution of the executive officer\u2019s\nresponsibilities, (ii) a change to the location of the executive officer\u2019s principal place of employment to a\nplace that is 50 or more miles away from the executive officer\u2019s current place of employment (unless the\nchange is no farther from the executive officer\u2019s current residence than the prior location), or Hanger\u2019s failure\nto provide at least 60 days\u2019 notice of its intent to relocate the executive officer, or (iii) Hanger\u2019s material\nbreach of the employment agreement.\nIn addition, certain of the executive officers may become entitled to additional benefits under Hanger\u2019s\nsupplemental executive retirement plans in connection with the Merger. Specifically, Mr. Asar and Mr.\nHartman would be entitled to an additional benefit accrual under Hanger\u2019s Defined Benefit Supplemental\nExecutive Retirement Plan if they are terminated without cause or for good reason equal to the benefit they\nwould have accrued if they had remained employed for the length of their severance period (30 months for\nMr. Asar, and 18 months for Mr. Hartman), and all participants in Hanger\u2019s Defined Contribution\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan who are not yet vested in their benefit (which include Mr. Stoy, Mr.\nDobson and Ms. Jolly) would become fully vested if terminated without cause or with good reason following\nthe Merger.\nFunding of Rabbi Trust\nMr. Asar and Mr. Hartman both participate in Hanger\u2019s Defined Benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement\nPlan, which provides benefit payments for 15 years following the executive\u2019s retirement. The Defined Benefit\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan is an \u201cunfunded plan,\u201d meaning that benefits are generally paid out\nof Hanger\u2019s general assets when due. However, pursuant to the terms of the Defined Benefit Supplemental\nExecutive Retirement Plan, no later than 30 days after a change in control, Hanger is required to establish and\nfund a \u201crabbi trust\u201d with assets equal to the present value of the accrued benefits of all participants in the\nplan, and make periodic contributions to the trust so that trust assets remain adequate to pay benefit\namounts. As required by applicable tax laws, however, the trust assets continue to be subject to the claims of\ncreditors in the event of insolvency.\n56 \n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nTransaction Bonus Pool\nHanger has approved a $350,000 transaction bonus pool to be paid in the form of cash bonuses to certain\nemployees in connection with their efforts with respect to the Merger if such employees remain employed by\nHanger through the closing of the Merger, with individual amounts to be determined by Hanger prior to the\nclosing of the Merger. Hanger has agreed that it will not allocate an amount from the bonus pool to any of\nthe named executive officers.\nContinuing Employees\nUnder the Merger Agreement, from the Effective Time until the first anniversary thereof, Parent will cause the\nsurviving corporation to provide to each employee of Hanger and any of its subsidiaries who, as of the\nclosing of the Merger, continues to be employed with Hanger or any of its subsidiaries (a \u201cContinuing\nEmployee\u201d), during any period of employment during such twelve month period, base compensation and a\ntarget annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less favorable than the base compensation and target\nannual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective\nTime, and other compensation and benefits (excluding equity award compensation, defined benefit pensions,\nnonqualified deferred compensation and change-in-control compensation or benefits) that are substantially\nequivalent in aggregate economic value to the other compensation and benefits provided to such Continuing\nEmployee immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement further provides that the surviving\ncorporation will continue all existing annual bonus plans and commission plans and arrangements through\nthe end of 2022 without change.\nWith respect to benefit plans maintained by the surviving corporation (including any vacation, paid time-off\nand severance plans, but excluding any defined benefit pension plans), the Continuing Employees will be\ngiven service credit for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting\nand benefit accruals under such benefit plans, for their length of service with (or otherwise recognized by)\nHanger or any of its subsidiaries, as reflected in Hanger\u2019s records, except that such service need not be\nrecognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.\nNamed Executive Officer Golden Parachute Compensation\nThe following table provides information about certain compensation for each of our named executive\nofficers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger. The values in this table assumes that the Merger\nclosed on July 31, 2022, that the employment agreements described above remain in effect, and that each\nnamed executive officer was terminated from employment immediately after the closing of the Merger without\ncause or for good reason. The compensation summarized in the table and footnotes below is subject to a\nnon-binding, advisory vote of Hanger\u2019s stockholders, as described in \u201cProposal 3: Advisory Vote on\nMerger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation\u201d.\nThe footnotes to the table identify whether the benefit is \u201csingle-trigger\u201d  (meaning the benefit is payable\nsolely as a result of the consummation of the Merger, and is not conditioned on a termination of the named\nexecutive officer\u2019s employment) or \u201cdouble trigger\u201d  (meaning a benefit that is only payable upon the named\nexecutive officer\u2019s termination of employment without cause or for good reason following the Merger).\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nName\nCash($)\nEquity($)\nPension/NQDC\n($)\nBenefits & \nPerquisites($)\nTotal($)\nVinit K.

Scott Ranson\n$\n1,124,337\n$\n109,311\nThis represents the cash value that will be paid with respect to the Company RSUs and Company\nPRSUs that will vest on an accelerated basis in connection with the Merger, as described above under\nthe heading \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger\u202f-\u202f\nTreatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards\u201d. This is a \u201csingle-trigger\u201d benefit. The value is\ncalculated by multiplying the total number of Company RSUs and Company PRSUs being vested by\n$18.75 per share of Hanger common stock (i.e., the Merger Consideration). The number of Company\nRSUs and Company PRSUs for which vesting will accelerate for each named executive officer can be\nfound above in the chart included above under the heading \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the Directors and\nExecutive Officers of Hanger in the Merger\u202f-\u202fTreatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards -\u200bEstimated\nValue of Accelerated Equity\u201d.\nAll amounts shown in this column are \u201cdouble trigger\u201d benefits. For Mr. Asar and Mr. Hartman, this\nrepresents the present value of the additional benefit which would accrue under the Defined Benefit\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan if either of them are terminated by Hanger without cause or by\nthe executive for good reason, in either case within two years following the Merger. Such additional\nbenefit is equal to additional credited service under the Defined Benefit Supplemental Executive\nRetirement Plan for the duration of any severance period (30 months for Mr. Asar, and 18 months for Mr.\nHartman). For Mr. Stoy, this represents the balance of his Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive\nRetirement Plan account (determined as of July 31, 2022) which would vest in full if he is terminated at\nany time following a change in control (such as the Merger) either by Hanger without cause or by him\nfor good reason. The Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan benefit otherwise\nvests following five years of employment. Mr. Kiraly and Mr. Ranson also participate in the Defined\nContribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, but their accounts are already fully vested and\nthus no additional benefit will be paid or accrue in connection with the Merger.\nAmounts in this column are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d benefits that will only be paid if the executive is terminated\nby Hanger without cause or resigns for good reason within two years following the Merger. The\namounts shown in this column include continued group medical, dental and life and disability coverage,\nfor a period of 30 months in the case of Mr. Asar, 24 months for Messrs. Kiraly, Stoy and Ranson, and\n18 months for Mr. Hartman, plus continued Hanger contributions to the 401(k) plan for the length of the\ninsurance continuation, plus continuation of the executive\u2019s monthly automobile allowance over the\nsame period (other than for Mr. Stoy), plus the estimated cost of outplacement services for 18 months\n(24 months for Mr. Asar).

Parent also indicated in\nsuch discussions that it expects members of Hanger\u2019s management team to use a portion of the proceeds\nthey receive from the Merger to purchase equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates, on customary\nterms. Following the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, Parent continued such introductory\ndiscussions with Hanger\u2019s management team, including regarding continued employment after the closing of\nthe Merger and potential terms of employment agreements, as well as a possible opportunity for Hanger\u2019s\nexecutive officers and other senior employees to purchase or otherwise participate in the equity of Parent or\none or more of its affiliates, on customary terms. As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Hanger\u2019s\nexecutive officers or other senior employees has entered into any agreement with respect to the foregoing,\nand there can be no assurances that any such agreements or arrangements will be entered into with any\nexecutive officers in the future. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, however, some or all of\nHanger\u2019s executive officers or other senior employees may enter into agreements with Parent or any of its\naffiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or\nmore of its affiliates. If Parent or any of its affiliates and Hanger\u2019s executive officers do not enter into\nagreements regarding employment with Parent or one or more of its affiliates, then Hanger\u2019s executive\nofficers will remain subject to their existing employment agreements with Hanger.",

            "text": "Financing of the Merger\nWe anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger, including the funds needed to pay Hanger\nstockholders and holders of other equity-based interests the amounts due to them under the Merger\nAgreement, will be approximately $1.25 billion based upon (i) the consideration payable under the Merger\nAgreement, (ii) the repayment and termination of Hanger\u2019s existing credit agreement and (iii) fees,\ncommissions and expenses in connection with the foregoing, which will be funded through a combination of\nthe following:\nDebt Financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to approximately $945 million, consisting of (i)\nsenior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $685 million (comprised of an\ninitial $550 million first lien term loan facility, a $35 million delayed draw first lien term loan facility and\na $100 million super senior secured revolving credit facility) and (ii) a senior secured second lien term\nloan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $260 million (comprised of an initial $245 million\nsecond lien term loan facility and a $15 million delayed draw second lien term loan facility)\u037e and\n60 \u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEquity Financing by Patient Square Equity in an aggregate amount of $410 million.\nThe funding of the Financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Commitment\nLetters under which the Financing will be provided, respectively. The obligation of the parties to complete\nthe Merger is not subject to a financing condition. However, the failure of Parent to obtain the Financing (or\nto secure alternative financing) would likely result in the failure of the Merger to be completed. If Hanger\nterminates the Merger Agreement due to Parent\u2019s failure to complete the Merger when the closing conditions\nhave been satisfied, subject to the requirements described in the Merger Agreement, Parent would be\nobligated to pay to Hanger a $45 million reverse termination fee. For a description of the circumstances in\nwhich the reverse termination fee would be paid to Hanger, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fees\u201d.\nDebt Financing\nMerger Sub, an affiliate of Patient Square, entered into a Debt Commitment Letter, dated as of July 21, 2022,\nwith Ares Capital Management LLC (together with such other lenders that become party thereto, the \u201cDebt\nCommitment Parties\u201d). Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt\nCommitment Parties have committed to arrange and syndicate senior secured credit facilities and a senior\nsecured second lien term facility in an aggregate amount of up to $945 million, consisting of (i) senior\nsecured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $685 million (comprised of an initial $550\nmillion first lien term loan facility, a $35 million delayed draw first lien term loan facility and a $100 million\nsuper senior secured revolving credit facility) and (ii) a senior secured second lien term loan facility in an\naggregate principal amount of $260 million (comprised of an initial $245 million second lien term loan facility\nand a $15 million delayed draw second lien term loan facility). The Debt Financing will be used to, among\nother things, (i) pay the consideration payable under the Merger Agreement, (ii) repay and terminate\nHanger\u2019s existing credit agreement, (iii) pay fees, commissions and expenses in connection with the\nforegoing and (iv) for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. The Debt Commitment\nLetter and the commitments thereunder will automatically terminate in the event that the closing of the\nMerger and the satisfaction of the conditions under the Debt Commitment Letter does not occur on or before\nthe earliest of (i) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is five business days after the Extended\nOutside Date, (ii) the date of the termination of the Merger Agreement by Merger Sub or with Merger Sub\u2019s\nwritten consent, in each case, prior to the closing of the Merger and (iii) the date of the closing of the Merger\nwithout the use of the Debt Financing.\nThe availability of the Debt Financing is subject to conditions precedent, customary for financings of\ntransactions comparable to the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent has agreed to use its\nreasonable best efforts to satisfy all such conditions precedent and to enforce its rights under the Debt\nCommitment Letter in the event of a Financing Failure Event. Parent has also agreed not to permit any\namendment, replacement, modification or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that would\nreduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless an equal amount from alternative financing\nsources is then made available), impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand any conditions\nthat would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the closing of the Merger, make the funding of the\nDebt Financing materially less likely to occur or materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent to\nenforce its rights against the Debt Commitment Parties.\nIf any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the\nDebt Commitment Letter, Parent is required to promptly notify Hanger and to use its reasonable best efforts\nto obtain alternative financing in an amount that when added with the Equity Financing would be sufficient\nto enable Parent to meet its funding obligations contemplated by the Merger Agreement, provided that the\nterms of such alternative financing are on terms as favorable to Parent as the terms of the Debt Commitment\nLetter or are as are reasonably available for financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment\nLetter in debt markets at such time. As of the last practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement\nwith the SEC, the Debt Commitment Letter remains in effect. The documentation governing the Debt\nFinancing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual\nterms of the Debt Financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement. The Debt Commitment\nParties may invite other banks, financial institutions and institutional lenders to participate in the Debt\nFinancing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.\n61 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nEquity Financing\nOn July 21, 2022, Patient Square Equity entered into the Equity Commitment Letter with Parent pursuant to\nwhich Patient Square Equity committed to make or cause to be made a cash equity investment of $410 million\nto Parent.

Because a proxy\nthat is signed and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked,\nbe voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, if you submit a proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal\nrights, you must include voting instructions to vote your share \u201cAGAINST,\u201d or as an abstention with\nrespect to, the Merger Proposal\u037e\n64 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nyou must continuously hold your shares of Hanger common stock from the date of making the written\ndemand for appraisal through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer\nyour shares of Hanger common stock before the Effective Time\u037e\nprior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, you must deliver a\nproper written demand for appraisal of your shares\u037e and\nyou, another stockholder who has complied with the applicable subsections of Section 262 of the\nDGCL and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, an appropriate\nbeneficial owner or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery\nrequesting a determination of the fair value of your shares of Hanger common stock within 120 days\nafter the Effective Time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any such petition in\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of\nthe appropriate Hanger stockholders to initiate all necessary action to properly demand their\nappraisal rights in respect of shares of Hanger common stock within the time prescribed in Section\n262 of the DGCL.\nFiling a Written Demand\nNeither voting against the Merger Proposal, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger\nProposal, will in and of itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section\n262 of the DGCL. Any holder of shares of Hanger common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must\ndeliver to Hanger, before the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, a written\ndemand for the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares. A stockholder\u2019s failure to deliver the written demand\nprior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of\nappraisal rights. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote\non the Merger Proposal.\nA demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. Only a holder of\nrecord may demand appraisal rights for the shares of Hanger common stock registered in that holder\u2019s name.\nSuch demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Hanger of the identity of the stockholder and that the\nstockholder intends to demand appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of his, her or its shares of Hanger common stock.\nBeneficial owners who do not also hold their shares of Hanger common stock of record may not directly\nmake appraisal demands to Hanger. The beneficial owner must, in such case, arrange for the holder of record,\nsuch as a bank, broker or nominee, to timely submit the required demand in respect of those shares of\nHanger common stock. A holder of record, such as a bank, broker or nominee, who holds shares of Hanger\ncommon stock as a nominee or intermediary for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the\nshares of Hanger common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for\nother beneficial owners. The written demand should state the number of shares of Hanger common stock as\nto which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Hanger common stock is expressly mentioned,\nthe demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Hanger common stock held in the name of the holder of\nrecord.\nIF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF HANGER COMMON STOCK IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR\nOTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT\nWITH YOUR BANK, BROKER OR NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE\nBANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES.\nIF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF HANGER COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD\nIN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A NOMINEE OR INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT\nPROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE HOLDER OF RECORD TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER\nTHE STEPS NECESSARY TO DEMAND YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF\nHANGER COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK OR BROKERAGE FIRM WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE\nSHARES THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORY NOMINEE, SUCH AS THE DEPOSITORY\nTRUST COMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY OR ON\nBEHALF OF THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE\nHOLDER OF RECORD.\n65 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf your shares of Hanger common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,\nguardian or custodian, execution of the demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if your\nshares are owned of record jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in\ncommon, the demand for appraisal should be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An\nauthorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a\nstockholder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and expressly\ndisclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the holder or holders of\nrecord. Stockholders who hold their shares of Hanger common stock in brokerage accounts or other nominee\nforms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers or other nominees to\ndetermine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.\nIf you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written\ndemand to:\nHanger, Inc. \n10910 Domain Drive, Suite 300 \nAustin, Texas 78758 \nAttention: Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Hanger stockholder that made a demand for appraisal\nbut has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined in such a proceeding as a named party will have\nthe right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger\nAgreement for his, her or its shares of Hanger common stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a\nwritten withdrawal of the demand for appraisal, but after such 60 day period a demand for appraisal may be\nwithdrawn only with the written approval of the surviving corporation.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation. Within ten days after the effective date of the Merger, Hanger, as the\nsurviving corporation, must notify each holder of Hanger common stock who has made a written demand for\nappraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal of the date\nthat the Merger has become effective.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within 120 days after the Effective\nTime, but not later, either you or another stockholder, provided you or such other stockholder have complied\nwith the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the\nsurviving corporation may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by you or another\nstockholder, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of Hanger common stock held by all\nstockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. None of Patient Square, Parent, Merger Sub or Hanger,\nas the surviving corporation, is under any obligation to file an appraisal petition or has any intention to do\nso. If you desire to have your shares of Hanger common stock appraised, you should initiate any petitions\nnecessary for properly demanding your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed\nin Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL, you will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a statement\nsetting forth the aggregate number of shares of Hanger common stock not voted in favor of the Merger\nProposal and with respect to which Hanger has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of\nholders of those shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of (i) ten\ndays after receipt by the surviving corporation of the request therefor or (ii) ten days after expiration of the\nperiod for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of Hanger common\nstock held in a voting trust or by a nominee or intermediary on your behalf you may, in your own name, file\nan appraisal petition or request from the surviving corporation the statement described in this paragraph. If a\npetition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to appraisal will cease.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record of Hanger common stock who has\nproperly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the\nDGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation\n66 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwill be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware\nRegister in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have\ndemanded an appraisal of their shares of Hanger common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of\ntheir shares of Hanger common stock have not been reached by the surviving corporation. The Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the petition hearing be given to the\nsurviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein.\nAny such notice shall also be given by one or more publications at least one week before the day of the\nhearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or any other\npublication which the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The forms of the notice by mail and by\npublication will be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery and the costs thereof will be borne by the\nsurviving corporation.\nAfter notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to\nconduct a hearing on the petition to determine which Hanger stockholders have complied with Section 262 of\nthe DGCL and have become entitled to appraisal rights and may require the Hanger stockholders demanding\nappraisal who hold certificated shares of Hanger common stock to submit their stock certificates to the\nRegister in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any Hanger stockholder who fails to comply with this\ndirection. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such\nshares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of Hanger common\nstock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Hanger common stock, or (ii) the value of\nthe consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares of Hanger common stock exceeds\n$1 million.\nThe appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of Hanger common stock owned by such\nstockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules\nspecifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will determine the fair value of the shares of Hanger common stock held by all Hanger stockholders\nwho have properly demanded their appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount\ndetermined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise\nfor good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the\nEffective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at\n5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during\nthe period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry\nof judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal\nan amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (i)\nthe difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the value is\ndetermined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if\nany, to the Hanger stockholders entitled to receive the same, forthwith in the case of uncertificated\nstockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders to the surviving corporation of their stock\ncertificates.\nDetermination of Fair Value. In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to\ntake into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the\nfactors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of\nvalue by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community\nand otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires\nconsideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has\nstated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which were known or which\ncould be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the\nDelaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known\nelements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\n67 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the\nDGCL to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or\nsusceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nAn opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair\nvalue of shares of Hanger common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than,\nthe same as or less than the Merger Consideration. Neither Parent nor Hanger, as the surviving corporation,\nanticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Hanger stockholder exercising appraisal\nrights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the\nDGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Hanger common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. No\nrepresentation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery.\nIf no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time, you will lose the right to an\nappraisal and will instead receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement,\nwithout interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include\nattorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) and may tax those costs upon the parties as the\nDelaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in\nconnection with the appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Hanger common stock entitled to appraisal.\nIn the absence of such an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses.\nIf you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you will not, from and\nafter the Effective Time, be entitled to vote the shares of Hanger common stock subject to the demand for\nany purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to holders of record of Hanger common stock as of a record date prior to the Effective\nTime.\nIf you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may\nwithdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of\nthe demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the consideration payable in the Merger to the surviving\ncorporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require\nwritten approval of the surviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of\nChancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nSuch approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided,\nhowever, that this provision will not affect the right of any Hanger stockholder that has made an appraisal\ndemand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to\nwithdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within 60\ndays after the Effective Time. If you fail to properly demand or successfully withdraw your demand for\nappraisal, or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of Hanger common stock will be deemed to\nhave been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without\ninterest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for properly demanding appraisal rights may\nresult in the loss of your appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the Merger\nConsideration for your shares of Hanger common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement, without\ninterest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nTHE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT\nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. IF YOU WISH\nTO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL\nAND/OR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE\nFOREGOING SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.\n68 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b",

            "text": "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to\nU.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each as defined below) of Hanger common stock who receive cash in\nexchange for shares of Hanger common stock pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is for general\ninformational purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax\nconsequences of the Merger. The tax consequences of the Merger under U.S. federal tax laws other than\nthose pertaining to income tax, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local and non-U.S.\ntax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\u201cCode\u201d), the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and published rulings and\nadministrative pronouncements of the IRS, in each case in effect as of the date of this proxy statement.\nThese authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations, and any such change or differing\ninterpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could affect the accuracy of the statements and\nconclusions set forth in this summary. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying\ninterpretation. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the\nstatements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. There can be no assurance that the\nIRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of\nthe Merger.\nThis discussion is limited to holders of shares of Hanger common stock who hold such shares as \u201ccapital\nassets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This\ndiscussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in\nlight of such holder\u2019s particular circumstances, including the application of the alternative minimum tax. In\naddition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders subject to\nspecial rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\nU.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\npersons holding shares of Hanger common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction\nstrategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment\u037e\nbanks, insurance companies and other financial institutions\u037e\nbrokers or dealers in securities or foreign currencies\u037e\ntraders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting\u037e\n\u201ccontrolled foreign corporations,\u201d \u201cpassive foreign investment companies\u201d and corporations that\naccumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax\u037e\n\u201cS corporations,\u201d partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities (and investors therein)\u037e\nreal estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies\u037e\ntax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations\u037e\npersons deemed to sell their shares of Hanger common stock under the constructive sale provisions\nof the Code\u037e\npersons who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or, following the Merger, the\nsurviving corporation\u037e\npersons who hold or received their shares of Hanger common stock pursuant to the exercise of any\nemployee stock option or otherwise as compensation\u037e and\ntax-qualified retirement plans.\n69 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nThis discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequence to holders of shares of\nHanger common stock who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under the DGCL.\nIf an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of\nHanger common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status\nof the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level.\nAccordingly, partnerships holding Hanger common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult\ntheir tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS OF\nHANGER COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S.\nFEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER ARISING UNDER THE U.S.\nFEDERAL TAX LAWS OTHER THAN THOSE PERTAINING TO INCOME TAX, INCLUDING ESTATE OR GIFT\nTAX LAWS, OR UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME\nTAX TREATY.\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders\nDefinition of a U.S. Holder\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d is any beneficial owner of shares of Hanger common stock\nthat for U.S. federal income tax purposes is or is treated as:\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\na corporation (or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created\nor organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source\u037e or\na trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more \u201cUnited States\npersons\u201d  (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) are authorized to control all\nsubstantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a \u201cUnited States\nperson\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nEffect of the Merger\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Hanger common stock in the Merger will\ngenerally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of any taxable gain or\nloss realized by a U.S. holder who receives cash for shares of Hanger common stock in the Merger will\ngenerally equal the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received for such shares (determined\nbefore the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted basis in such\nshares. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted basis in a share will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid\nfor such share. The amount and character of such gain or loss and the holding period of shares will be\ndetermined separately for each block of shares of Hanger common stock (that is, shares acquired at the same\ncost in a single transaction) exchanged for cash in the Merger. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder\nupon the receipt of cash in exchange for a share of Hanger common stock in the Merger will generally be\ncapital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such share for more\nthan one year at the Effective Time. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss, which\nis subject to U.S. federal income tax at the same rates as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains recognized\nby certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally taxable at a reduced rate. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nA surtax of up to 3.8% may apply to so-called \u201cnet investment income\u201d of certain U.S. citizens or residents,\nand to undistributed \u201cnet investment income\u201d of certain estates and trusts. Net investment income includes\nany gain recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Hanger common stock pursuant to the\nMerger. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of the tax on gain recognized\npursuant to the Merger.\n70 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made to a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Hanger common stock pursuant to the Merger may\nbe subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid\nbackup withholding on such payments, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should\ncomplete and return to the Paying Agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of\ntransmittal certifying that such holder is a U.S. person, that the taxpayer identification number provided is\ncorrect and that such holder is not subject to backup withholding. Certain holders (including corporations)\nare not subject to backup withholding or these information reporting rules.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from cash payments to a U.S. holder\npursuant to the Merger under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against\nsuch U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely\nfurnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an\nexemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.\nTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\nDefinition of a Non-U.S. Holder\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Hanger common\nstock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nEffect of the Merger\nA non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt\nof cash in exchange for shares of Hanger common stock in the Merger unless:\nthe gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business within the\nUnited States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, such gain is also attributable to a\npermanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base, maintained by the non-U.S.\nholder in the United States)\u037e\nthe non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more\nduring the taxable year of the disposition of shares of Hanger common stock in the Merger, and\ncertain other requirements are met\u037e or\nHanger is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d) for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger\nor the period that the non-U.S. holder held shares of Hanger common stock and the non-U.S. holder\nheld (actually or constructively) more than five percent of the shares of Hanger common stock at any\ntime during such five-year period.\nGain described in the first bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net\nincome basis at the regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such non-U.S.\nholder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax\nat a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on after-tax\nprofits effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that such after-tax profits are not\nreinvested and maintained in the business.\nGain described in the second bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate\nof 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset\nby U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident\nof the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with\nrespect to such losses.\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, the determination of whether Hanger is a USRPHC depends on\nthe fair market value of its United States real property interests relative to the fair market value\n71",

Appraisal Rights.\n(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a\ndemand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds\nsuch shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with\nsubsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor\nconsented thereto in writing pursuant to \u00a7 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of\nChancery of the fair value of the stockholder\u2019s shares of stock under the circumstances described in\nsubsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word \u201cstockholder\u201d means a holder of\nrecord of stock in a corporation\u037e the words \u201cstock\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d mean and include what is ordinarily meant\nby those words\u037e and the words \u201cdepository receipt\u201d mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a\ndepository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,\nwhich stock is deposited with the depository.\n(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent\ncorporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to \u00a7 251 (other than a merger effected\npursuant to \u00a7 251(g) of this title), \u00a7 252, \u00a7 254, \u00a7 255, \u00a7 256, \u00a7 257, \u00a7 258, \u00a7 263 or \u00a7 264 of this title:\n(1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any\nclass or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to\ndetermine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the\nagreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to \u00a7 251(h), as of immediately\nprior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were either:\n(i) listed on a national securities exchange or\n(ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders\u037e and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be\navailable for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did\nnot require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in\n\u00a7 251(f) of this title.\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be\navailable for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof\nare required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 251, 252, 254, 255,\n256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:\na. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or\ndepository receipts in respect thereof\u037e\nb. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares\nof stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of\nthe merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record\nby more than 2,000 holders\u037e\nc. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing\nparagraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section\u037e or\nd. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares\nor fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this\nsection.\n(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under \u00a7\n253 or \u00a7 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall\nbe available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.\n(4) [Repealed by 2020 Amendment.]\nB-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS\n(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section\nshall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its\ncertificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent\ncorporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of\nincorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in\nsubsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.\n(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\n(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to\nbe submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to\nthe meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such\nmeeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with \u00a7 255(c) of this title) with respect to\nshares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that\nappraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall\ninclude in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock\ncorporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such\nstockholder\u2019s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or\nconsolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a demand may\nbe delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing\nsystem (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it\nreasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends\nthereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or\nconsolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so\nby a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger\nor consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each\nconstituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or\nconsented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become\neffective\u037e or\n(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \u00a7 228, \u00a7 251(h), \u00a7 253, or \u00a7 267 of this title,\nthen either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the\nsurviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class\nor series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of\nthe merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or\nseries of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section\nand, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Such\nnotice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify\nsuch stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to\nappraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger\napproved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer\ncontemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing\nfrom the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a\ndemand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be\nsufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the\nstockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If such notice did not\nnotify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent\ncorporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying\neach of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to\nappraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting\ncorporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective\ndate\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of\nthe first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later\nof the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the\nsending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to\nappraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares in accordance with this\nB-2 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsubsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the\ncorporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of\nfraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders\nentitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that\nshall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given\non or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date.\nIf no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the\nclose of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.\n(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting\ncorporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and\nwho is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in\nthe Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding\nas a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nterms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this\nsection hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled\nto receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting\nforth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a\nmerger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded\nstock (as defined in \u00a7 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and\naccepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to\nwhich demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such\nstatement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request for such a\nstatement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the\nperiod for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.\nNotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock\nheld either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a\npetition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the\nsurviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the\nRegister in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses\nof all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value\nof their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed\nby the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The\nRegister in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing\nof such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the\nstockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more\npublications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in\nthe City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices\nby mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation.\n(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this\nsection and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have\ndemanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their\ncertificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal\nproceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the\nproceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class\nor series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a\nnational securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who\nare otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds\n1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration\nB-3 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprovided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger\nwas approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing\nappraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or\nconsolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In\ndetermining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its\ndiscretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest\nfrom the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded\nquarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of\npayment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving\ncorporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall\naccrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so\npaid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless\npaid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled\nto participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal\nprior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name\nappears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section\nand who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is\nrequired, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not\nentitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each\nsuch stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares\nrepresented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock.\nThe Court\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether\nsuch surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.\n(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court\ndeems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion\nof the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the\nvalue of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.\n(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded\nappraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any\npurpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided\nin subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation\na written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or\nconsolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in\nsubsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of\nsuch stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the\nCourt of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such\napproval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just\u037e provided, however that this\nprovision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept\nthe terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.\n(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders\nwould have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-4 \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n(ix) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nAppendix C\u200b\nGlobal Corporate & Investment Banking \nBofA Securities, Inc. \nOne Bryant Park, New York, NY 10036\u200b\nJuly 21, 2022\nThe Board of Directors \nHanger, Inc. \n10910 Domain Drive, Suite 300 \nAustin, TX 78758\nMembers of the Board of Directors:\nWe understand that Hanger, Inc.
