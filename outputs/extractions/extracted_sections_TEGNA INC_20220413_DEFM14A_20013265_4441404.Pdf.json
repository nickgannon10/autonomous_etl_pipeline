This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or\nother tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal\ntax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you\nof the merger.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of TEGNA common stock is required\nto adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present or\nrepresented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required for approval of\neach of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed\nproxy card\u037e (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d)\u037e or (iii) vote\nvirtually at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal\nbut, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment\nProposal. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to\ninstruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the\nAdjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal, the\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Each \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the\nCompensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the\nboxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed\nproxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e and\n(3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,\nstockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of TEGNA common stock. Instead, TEGNA will remain\nan independent public company, TEGNA common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and\nregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nUnder specified circumstances, TEGNA will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $163 million, upon the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Termination Fees.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation\nProposal?\nA:\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require TEGNA to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote\nwith respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with\nthe Merger.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with\nrespect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on TEGNA. Therefore, if the\napproval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable\nunder the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to TEGNA\u2019s named executive officers in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,\nincluding, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this\nproxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects\nyou.

However, the exact timing of completion\nof the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the\nMerger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our control.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain additional information about TEGNA?\nA:\nTEGNA will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2021 Annual\nReport to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021,\nwithout charge to any stockholder who makes a written request to our Secretary at 8350 Broad Street, Suite 2000,\nTysons, Virginia 22102.

This process, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d\npotentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTEGNA and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials\nto multiple stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been\nreceived from the affected stockholders. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and\nwould prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these\ndocuments and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if\nyour shares are held in a brokerage account or TEGNA if you are a stockholder of record by sending a written\nrequest to our Secretary at 8350 Broad Street, Suite 2000, Tysons, Virginia 22102.

A so-called\n\u201cbroker non-vote\u201d results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or\nmatters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal\nbecause they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting\ninstructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. TEGNA does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special\nMeeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary\nauthority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the\nSpecial Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of TEGNA\ncommon stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions.

This review includes, among other matters, the consideration\nof potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives. The\nBoard of Directors has also regularly engaged with TEGNA stockholders to discuss and solicit their perspectives on\nits strategic and financial direction.

Following these discussions, the\nBoard of Directors determined that it would not be advisable for Mr. Kim to be appointed to the Board of Directors at\nthis time, in part because of the Board of Directors\u2019 view, in accordance with TEGNA\u2019s Ethics Policy, that Mr. Kim had\nconflicts of interest due to his and Standard General\u2019s affiliation with Standard Media Group and MediaCo Holding,\ntwo companies in the broadcasting industry.\nBetween January and April 2020, Standard General nominated four individuals - including Mr. Kim and Deborah\nMcDermott, the Chief Executive Officer of Standard Media - to the Board of Directors, and ran a proxy contest in\nconnection with such nominations.\nOn January 15, 2020, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial\nownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 9.7% of TEGNA common stock.\nOn February 20, 2020, TEGNA received an informal, verbal offer from Party A, a broadcasting industry participant, to\npotentially acquire TEGNA for $18.50 in cash and $1.50 in shares of Party A common stock, subject to due diligence.\nThereafter, the Board of Directors discussed this proposal with members of TEGNA senior management and financial\nand legal advisors, and authorized management and advisors to enter discussions with Party A, including to\nnegotiate a non-disclosure agreement to facilitate Party A\u2019s due diligence review of TEGNA.\nFollowing various preliminary discussions over the prior year regarding the exploration of possible transactions,\nincluding a possible combination of certain assets, between representatives of TEGNA and Apollo, on February 24,\n2020, TEGNA entered into a reciprocal non-disclosure agreement with an affiliate of Apollo,\n28TABLE OF CONTENTS\nwhich contained a customary standstill restriction that allowed Apollo to submit confidential proposals to the Chief\nExecutive Officer or Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Following further discussion regarding possible responses to Apollo, whether\nor not to approach other possible acquirers, the risk of leaks, regulatory considerations and risks inherent in a\ntransaction with Apollo and other parties, the uncertainty surrounding the future of the media industry and the\npotential for continuing consolidation in the broadcast industry, the Board of Directors then authorized management\nto communicate to Apollo that the proposed consideration was insufficient, but that TEGNA was willing to engage\nand possibly provide additional due diligence materials to assist them in increasing the value of their proposal. The\nBoard of Directors also authorized management to reach out to Party A and certain other potential counterparties to\nassess their interest in a potential transaction with TEGNA.\nThereafter, Dave Lougee, the Chief Executive Officer of TEGNA, and representatives of J.P.

The proposal letter also indicated that if Apollo were to receive access to targeted due diligence\ninformation, they were confident that they could deliver a highly compelling proposal to TEGNA stockholders.

TEGNA\u2019s management discussed with the Board of Directors TEGNA\u2019s financial performance,\nbusiness trends and the updated forecasted financial information that was provided to TEGNA\u2019s financial advisors\nand the bidders, noting that management believed these updated forecasts should support a higher offer.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill then reviewed and discussed with the Board of Directors their\nrespective updated preliminary valuation analyses, including based on the updated financial forecasts. The Board of\nDirectors then discussed with TEGNA\u2019s management and financial and legal advisors the various aspects of\nTEGNA\u2019s valuation, standalone prospects and strategy for communicating TEGNA\u2019s views on value to Standard\nGeneral.\nOn December 2, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed TEGNA\u2019s views on value with Mr. Kim, including\nexplaining various analyses that corresponded to a higher per share price than offered by Standard General. Mr. Kim\nresponded that he would be prepared to pay more than the last offer of $22.65 per share, but that the advisors for\nboth parties would need to resolve the remaining open points in the merger agreement. Representatives of J.P.\nMorgan noted that representatives of Wachtell Lipton would soon circulate a revised draft of the merger agreement.\nOn December 3, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Fried Frank a revised draft of the\nmerger agreement, and thereafter the parties continued to exchange drafts of the merger agreement and the ancillary\nagreements through their respective legal advisors, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton, Fried Frank, Paul, Weiss,\nRifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d), Apollo\u2019s legal advisor, Cooley LLP, regulatory counsel to Apollo,\nCovington and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, regulatory counsel to Standard General, continued to discuss\nthe open issues in these agreements.\nOn December 4 and 5, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with certain equity financing sources for Party\nB the status of the equity and debt financing for Party B\u2019s proposal to acquire TEGNA, including various issues that\nthe financing sources and Party B were negotiating and the potential timeline for Party B to submit a fully financed\nand actionable revised proposal to TEGNA.\nOn December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting, which was attended by TEGNA\u2019s management\nand financial and legal advisors. During the meeting, representatives of TEGNA\u2019s financial and legal advisors\nprovided the Board of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General and Party B and\ndiscussed various open issues with the directors. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton summarized and discussed\nwith the directors the significant open issues in the merger agreement, including the regulatory efforts covenant, the\namount and triggers for the regulatory and financing reverse termination fees, the \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d definition\nand exceptions and what actions would be permitted under the interim operating covenants. Following this\ndiscussion, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton summarized and discussed with the Board of\nDirectors Party B\u2019s proposed terms and financing structure and associated risks.\nOn December 8, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with financial advisors of Standard General TEGNA\u2019s\nfeedback on certain material terms in the merger agreement and views on the valuation that were communicated to Mr.\nKim on December 2, 2021.

Morgan discussed with representatives of Party B the status of\nParty B\u2019s financing efforts.\nOn December 9, 2021, representatives of Standard General provided TEGNA with a letter in which Standard General\nstated that its proposal to acquire TEGNA for $22.65 per share provided a compelling value opportunity for TEGNA\nstockholders and that the terms of the draft merger agreement that Standard General was willing to accept were\nfavorable to TEGNA, including a \u201chell-or-high water\u201d regulatory covenant to address any regulatory concerns, a\ncommitment on the part of CMG Media Corporation (\u201cCMG\u201d) (an Apollo portfolio company that owns Cox Media\nGroup) to cooperate with the regulatory approval process (which was one of the requirements that representatives of\nTEGNA conveyed to representatives of Standard General) and a regulatory reverse termination fee of 4%. The letter\nfurther stated that if TEGNA did not provide a response by 12:00 p.m. on December 13, 2021 in the form of a price at\nwhich TEGNA would be prepared to transact, Standard General would be forced to conclude that TEGNA was\nunwilling to engage in a transaction and would discontinue its pursuit of TEGNA.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 12, 2021, following a discussion between representatives of J.P. Morgan and Mr. Kim and Standard\nGeneral\u2019s financial advisor, Mr. Elias and Mr. Lougee, on behalf of TEGNA, sent a letter to Mr. Kim, informing Mr. Kim\nthat since the initial proposal to acquire TEGNA for a purchase price in the range of $22.00 to $24.00 per share,\nTEGNA had reported strong earnings for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021 and that many of the same\ntrends continued. The letter further stated that the Board of Directors would be prepared to transact at a price of\n$25.00 per share, assuming the parties could resolve the remaining issues in the merger agreement.\nOn December 14, 2021, representatives of an equity financing source for Party B notified representatives of J.P.\nMorgan that they and Party B did not reach an agreement on terms between them and as a result this financing\nsource would not proceed further as a financing source for Party B. Representatives of J.P. Morgan confirmed this\ndiscussion with representatives of Party B on December 15, 2021. The representatives of Party B indicated that Party\nB intended to seek to replace its equity financing sources and needed more time to submit a fully financed proposal.\nOn December 14, 2021, TEGNA\u2019s, Standard General\u2019s and Apollo\u2019s legal advisors discussed various issues in the\nmerger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the regulatory efforts covenant, representations\nregarding regulatory matters, the regulatory reverse termination fee and triggers for that fee, flexibility for TEGNA to\nconduct its business prior to the closing, including in connection with negotiations and entering into material\ncontracts, financing efforts and cooperation covenants, including a proposed \u201cmarketing period,\u201d the definition of\n\u201cCompany Material Adverse Effect\u201d and exceptions, covenants regarding non-solicitation of alternative proposals,\nclosing conditions and termination rights and certain other issues.\nOn December 15, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed Mr. Kim and Standard General\u2019s advisors that Mr.\nElias was prepared to meet with Mr. Kim to engage in continued negotiations on the transaction price and other\nmaterial deal terms if Standard General were prepared to materially increase its proposed purchase price towards\nTEGNA\u2019s last proposal of $25.00 per share. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also stated that prior to the meeting,\nrepresentatives of TEGNA, including Mr. Lougee, and its advisors would first need to discuss various issues in the\nmerger agreement with representatives and advisors of Standard General, including those related to operating\ncovenants and flexibility to enter into material contracts between signing and closing. The parties also discussed the\npotential timeline of the contemplated transaction, and the possibility that the timeline to a potential signing would\nlikely extend into the beginning of 2022.\nOn December 16, 2021 and December 17, 2021, TEGNA\u2019s, Standard General\u2019s and Apollo\u2019s representatives, including\nlegal advisors, continued to discuss various issues in the merger agreement and the other transaction documents,\nand representatives of Wachtell Lipton circulated revised drafts of the merger agreement and the other transaction\ndocuments to representatives of Fried Frank.\nAt a telephonic meeting of the Board of Directors held on December 19, 2021, Mr. Elias and members of management\nprovided the Board of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General and Party B.\nWith respect to Standard General, Mr. Elias updated the Board of Directors on the letter sent to Mr. Kim on December\n12, 2021, as well as on the open issues in the merger agreement, including the merger consideration negotiation and\nthe regulatory reverse termination fee issues. Members of the Board of Directors and TEGNA\u2019s management\ndiscussed TEGNA\u2019s strategy for resolving any open issues on the merger agreement (including the price and the\npossibility of proposing a \u201cticking fee\u201d to both bridge any valuation gap and incentivize Standard General to proceed\nmore expeditiously towards a closing), ongoing work streams, proposed timing and the status of the financing\ndocumentation, and members of the Board of Directors provided guidance to Mr. Elias and members of management\non certain of these matters and authorized them to continue negotiating with Standard General to resolve these\nissues consistent with their guidance, including with respect to price. With respect to Party B, Mr. Elias updated the\nBoard on Party B\u2019s financing efforts. Thereafter, on December 21, 2021 and December 22, 2021, representatives of J.P.\nMorgan and Mr. Kim discussed the timing for the negotiations regarding the remaining open issues in the merger\nagreement, including the merger consideration.\nAlso on December 21, 2021, TEGNA\u2019s, Standard General\u2019s and Apollo\u2019s legal advisors discussed various issues in the\nmerger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the regulatory efforts covenant,\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrepresentations regarding regulatory matters, the regulatory reverse termination fee and triggers for that fee, flexibility\nfor TEGNA to conduct its business prior to the closing, including in connection with negotiations and entering into\nmaterial contracts, financing efforts and cooperation covenants, including a proposed \u201cmarketing period\u201d and certain\nother issues.\nOn December 25, 2021, representatives of Fried Frank circulated a revised draft of the merger agreement to\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton and Covington.\nOn December 27, 2021, representatives of TEGNA (including Mr. Elias and Mr. Lougee), Standard General, Apollo,\nWachtell Lipton, Fried Frank and Paul Weiss held several discussions regarding the open issues in the merger\nagreement and the other transaction agreements, including the regulatory efforts covenant, the regulatory reverse\ntermination fee and triggers for that fee, flexibility for TEGNA to conduct its business prior to the closing, including in\nconnection with negotiations and entering into material contracts, and certain other issues. During this discussion,\nMr. Elias and Mr. Lougee stressed that valuation, deal certainty and speed were critical elements for TEGNA, and\nexplained that while TEGNA believed in its standalone prospects, TEGNA was amenable to a transaction with terms\nthat would provide more value to TEGNA stockholders than its standalone prospects.\nOn December 28, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton, Fried Frank and Paul Weiss continued to discuss certain\nopen issues in the merger agreement and the ancillary agreements, including the financing efforts and cooperation\ncovenants.\nOn January 3, 2022, TEGNA\u2019s and Standard General\u2019s advisors discussed the next steps in the potential transaction,\nwith Standard General\u2019s advisors indicating that they were discussing with their financing sources the open points in\nthe merger agreement, particularly TEGNA\u2019s position that the payment of the regulatory reverse termination fee\nshould not require a breach of the merger agreement. On January 7, 2022, Mr. Kim spoke to representatives of J.P.\nMorgan regarding the proposed transaction during which they discussed the regulatory reverse termination fee and\nthe agreement on the hell-or-high water regulatory covenant. Mr. Kim further stated to representatives of J.P. Morgan\nthat he wanted to present an updated proposal to Mr. Elias directly, in which he would also propose a possible\ncompromise position on the regulatory reverse termination fee structure.\nOn January 8, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim spoke regarding the terms of the proposed transaction. During this\ndiscussion, Mr. Kim offered a potential compromise structure in which Standard General would pay a lower regulatory\nreverse termination fee if there was no breach of the merger agreement (for example, the parties failed to obtain the\nrequired regulatory approvals by the Outside Date but fully complied with their obligations under the merger\nagreement to obtain those regulatory approvals) and that there would be a higher regulatory reverse termination fee if\nthere was a material breach of the regulatory covenant. In terms of merger consideration, Mr. Kim stated that\nStandard General was willing to increase the proposed purchase price to $23.65 per share if TEGNA were to accept\ntheir position on the reverse termination fee construct, in which a breach would be required to trigger the payment of\nany regulatory reverse termination fee. Alternatively, Standard General would pay the $22.65 per share previously\nproposed but would agree to a bifurcated regulatory reverse termination fee structure, with Standard General paying\n2% of TEGNA\u2019s equity value in a no-breach scenario and there being a termination fee of 4% of TEGNA\u2019s equity\nvalue if there was a breach of the merger agreement. Following this discussion, Mr. Elias informed the Board of\nDirectors of this proposal.\nOn January 10, 2022, Mr. Kim contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to discuss the proposed transaction. Mr. Kim\nindicated that he had a productive discussion with Mr. Elias regarding the proposed merger consideration and the\nregulatory reverse termination fee and a possible path forward through a bifurcated fee structure, and explained his\nproposal to representatives of J.P. Morgan. Representatives of J.P. Morgan informed Mr. Kim that they expected Mr.\nElias to revert soon with TEGNA\u2019s response.\nOn January 11, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued their discussion of the transaction price and the structure and\namount of the regulatory reverse termination fee. During this discussion, Mr. Elias indicated that TEGNA would not\nagree to a regulatory termination construct that required a breach for the payment of any fee. However, Mr. Elias\nstated that TEGNA would be willing to proceed with the proposed transaction if the purchase price was $24.65 per\nshare, and would be prepared to accept a bifurcated regulatory reverse termination fee structure with a fee of 2.75%\nof TEGNA\u2019s equity value at the deal price if there was no breach of the merger\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nagreement, with the fee increasing to 5.5% if there was a breach of the merger agreement. Mr. Elias also explained that\nTEGNA\u2019s willingness to agree to a bifurcated fee structure was a significant concession and as a result Standard\nGeneral and Apollo would need to agree to the robust regulatory efforts covenant that TEGNA\u2019s legal advisors were\nnegotiating.\nOn January 13, 2022, Mr. Kim communicated to Mr. Elias that Standard General would agree to proceed on the basis\nof a bifurcated regulatory reverse termination fee structure but only if the purchase price for TEGNA was $23.10 and\nthe regulatory reverse termination fees were 2.25% of TEGNA\u2019s equity value in a no-breach scenario and 4.5% of\nTEGNA\u2019s equity value in a breach scenario.\nOn January 14, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued their discussion of the transaction price and the structure and\namount of the regulatory reverse termination fee. During this discussion, Mr. Elias rejected Mr. Kim\u2019s most recent\nproposal and discussed with Mr. Kim TEGNA\u2019s ongoing positive performance and views on valuation, and indicated\nthat if Standard General were to propose a price above $24.00 per share, TEGNA and its advisors would expeditiously\nproceed to finalize negotiations on the remaining points.\nAlso on January 14, 2022, a representative of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to inform J.P. Morgan\nthat Party B\u2019s stand-alone performance was improving and it was continuing to look for different structures and\nfinancing alternatives to potentially acquire TEGNA.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting, which was attended by TEGNA\u2019s management and\nfinancial and legal advisors. During the meeting, Mr. Elias and Mr. Lougee provided the Board of Directors with an\nupdate on the status of negotiations with Standard General, including the negotiations regarding the merger\nconsideration, the regulatory reverse termination fee (including the proposal by Standard General to bifurcate the\namount of this fee if there was a material breach of the regulatory efforts covenant) and the possibility of introducing\na \u201cticking fee\u201d concept to bridge the valuation gap and incentivize Standard General to more expeditiously attempt to\nobtain regulatory approvals for the transaction. Following discussions regarding these topics, Mr. Elias described to\nthe Board of Directors the recent outreach by Party B to representatives of J.P. Morgan. Also, during this meeting,\nMr. Lougee discussed with the Board of Directors TEGNA\u2019s recent and expected financial performance and\ndiscussions with distributors and provided a brief business and investor relations update.\nOn January 18, 2022, representatives of Party B and its financial advisor contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to\ninform them that Party B was actively pursuing an updated financing package in order to submit a revised proposal to\nacquire TEGNA and provided details on Party B\u2019s potential updated financing structure.\nBetween January 18, 2022 and January 21, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued to negotiate the open issues in the\nmerger agreement and the ancillary agreements. During this period, Mr. Kim proposed to Mr. Elias merger\nconsideration of $23.70 in cash. Following discussion with TEGNA\u2019s management and financial advisors, Mr. Elias\ninformed Mr. Kim that TEGNA would be prepared to agree to a transaction at $24.50 per share. Mr. Elias also indicated\nthat Standard General could agree to a \u201cticking fee\u201d if the transaction was not consummated within nine months\nfollowing signing as a way to bridge the valuation gap and provide additional comfort to TEGNA on Standard\nGeneral\u2019s efforts to consummate the closing on a more expedited timeline. In addition, Mr. Elias proposed that the\namount of the regulatory reverse termination fee be 2.5% of TEGNA\u2019s equity value at the transaction price if there is\nno breach of the merger agreement or 5% if there is a breach. Mr. Elias also proposed that the financing failure reverse\ntermination fee be 5% of TEGNA\u2019s equity value at the transaction price. The following day, Mr. Kim provided to Mr.\nElias a further counteroffer of either $24.00 per share and no ticking fee, or $23.90 per share and a ticking fee of $0.10\ncents per month starting nine months after the signing of the merger agreement. Mr. Elias indicated that he believed\nthat $24.00 would be acceptable but only (i) with the ticking fee of $0.05 per month starting after nine months, and\nescalating to $0.15 per month after 12 months and (ii) if Standard General would accept TEGNA\u2019s remaining positions\non the regulatory efforts covenant and certain other open issues. Mr. Kim stated that he would agree to this\nconstruct but would need to seek approval from his financing sources.\nOn January 21, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting during which Mr. Elias provided the Board of\nDirectors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General and its financing sources, including\nthat there was an agreement (subject to the approval of the Board of Directors) on the price of $24.00 per share and\nthe amount of the financing and regulatory reverse termination fees, and described the\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nremaining open issues in the merger agreement such as the regulatory efforts covenant and TEGNA\u2019s \u201cticking fee\u201d\nproposal, which was being considered by Standard General and its financing sources. Members of the Board of\nDirectors indicated support for the terms that were negotiated. Mr. Elias also provided an update on interactions with\nParty B.\nOn January 24, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued to discuss the terms of the proposed transaction, with Mr. Kim\nconfirming the agreement on $24.00 per share and a \u201cticking fee\u201d of $0.05 per month for the period between nine and\n12 months following execution of definitive transaction documents, and also indicating that Standard General would\naccept most of TEGNA\u2019s requests on the regulatory efforts covenant and certain other open points. However, Mr.\nKim noted that the amount of the \u201cticking fee\u201d after 12 months following signing remained an open item, but that he\nwas confident it would be resolved in due course. Based on this discussion, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim further agreed that\nthe parties and their advisors would expeditiously continue discussing and finalizing the transaction agreements.\nOn January 24, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Fried Frank a revised draft of the\nmerger agreement reflecting Mr. Elias\u2019 and Mr. Kim\u2019s agreement, and thereafter the parties continued to discuss and\nexchange drafts of the merger agreement and the other transaction documents through February 21, 2022, including\nnegotiating the terms of the non-solicitation covenant, the regulatory efforts covenant, the restrictions on TEGNA\u2019s\noperations between signing and closing, the triggers for the regulatory reverse termination fees, TEGNA\u2019s efforts to\nassist Standard General in its financing efforts and certain other issues.\nOn January 31, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting during which Mr. Elias and representatives of\nWachtell Lipton provided the Board of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General\nand its financing sources, noting that a summary of the current draft merger agreement and the other transaction\nagreements had been provided to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting. As part of this update, Mr. Elias again\ndescribed to the Board of Directors the terms that had been agreed with Standard General if the transaction was\nultimately approved by the Board of Directors, including (i) that the amount of the merger consideration would be\n$24.00 per share, (ii) the amount of the \u201cticking fee\u201d of $0.05 per month for the period between nine and 12 months\nfollowing execution of definitive transaction documents (with Mr. Elias noting that the amount of the \u201cticking fee\u201d for\nmonths 12 through 15 remained subject to further negotiation), and (iii) the amount of the financing and regulatory\nreverse termination fees. Mr. Elias summarized for the Board of Directors the various work streams that were in\nprocess with respect to the proposed transaction, including an update on Standard General\u2019s efforts to obtain\nadditional preferred equity financing sources. Mr. Elias also discussed with the Board of Directors the potential\ntimeline to reaching the end of negotiations. Mr. Elias reported that TEGNA had not received any updates from Party\nB. Mr. Lougee then described to the Board of Directors his discussions with Deborah A. McDermott, the CEO of\nStandard Media, in which Mr. Lougee provided an in-depth overview of TEGNA and discussed the communications\nplan for TEGNA and Standard Media if a transaction were to be announced.\nOn February 2, 2022, a representative of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to provide an update on its\nefforts to obtain equity and debt financing for a possible acquisition of TEGNA, including that it was replacing\ncertain of its potential equity financing sources with others. The representative of Party B also indicated that Party B\nnow intended to submit a revised proposal within one to two weeks. Thereafter, on February 21, 2022, a\nrepresentative of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to indicate that Party B was progressing on its\nefforts to obtain preferred financing and intended to soon submit to TEGNA a term sheet for the preferred equity\nfinancing.\nBetween January 31, 2022 and February 9, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim and other representatives of the parties and\ntheir respective advisors continued to discuss the open points in the merger agreement, the timing of the proposed\ntransaction, the status of the financing efforts being undertaken by Standard General, including additional preferred\nequity financing sources that Apollo was seeking to have join the proposed transaction. During this period, the\nparties also exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and other transaction documents.\nOn February 10, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim and other representatives of TEGNA and Standard General discussed\ncertain open issues in the merger agreement, including the amount of the \u201cticking fee,\u201d the triggers for the higher\nregulatory reverse termination fee, the regulatory efforts covenants and TEGNA\u2019s flexibility to negotiate material\nagreements in the interim period prior to closing, with the parties agreeing as part of these discussions on the amount\nof the \u201cticking fee\u201d to be set forth in the merger agreement.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBetween February 11 and 21, 2022, representatives of the parties continued to negotiate the remaining open points in\nthe merger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the efforts required to obtain regulatory\napprovals, the triggers for the payment of the higher regulatory reverse termination fee, TEGNA\u2019s flexibility to\nnegotiate material agreements in the interim period prior to closing and the terms of the preferred equity commitment\nletter and limited guarantee.

The Board of Directors considered a number of\nfactors, including those below (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which it viewed as\ngenerally supporting its (i) approval of the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by TEGNA, the\nperformance by TEGNA of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation\nof the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e and (ii) resolution to\nrecommend that the TEGNA stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL:\n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of TEGNA common stock, including the market performance of\nTEGNA common stock relative to those of other participants in TEGNA\u2019s industry and general market\nindices, and the fact that the Base Per Share Merger Consideration constituted a premium of 39.0% over\nTEGNA\u2019s closing stock price of $17.26 on September 14, 2021 (the last trading day before market rumors\nabout the potential acquisition of TEGNA appeared in the media), a premium of 38.0% over TEGNA\u2019s 20-\ntrading-day volume-weighted average share price through that date, and a premium of 11.0% over TEGNA\u2019s\nall-time high closing price since separation from the Gannett publishing business in 2015\u037e\n\u2022\nrisks associated with continuing to operate TEGNA as a standalone broadcasting company, including risks\nrelated to TEGNA\u2019s long-term strategic plan, industry trends and changes in laws and regulations affecting\nthe broadcasting industry, including FCC regulatory, legislative or implementation initiatives that could\naffect TEGNA\u2019s operations and business condition\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board of Directors\u2019 belief that TEGNA had engaged in an extensive and lengthy review of strategic\nalternatives over the past two years, with the assistance of J.P.

Greenhill has confirmed its February 21, 2022 oral opinion by\ndelivering its written opinion to the Board of Directors, dated February 22, 2022, that, as of such date, the $24.00 in\ncash per share of TEGNA common stock to be paid to the TEGNA stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such stockholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Greenhill, dated February 22, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of Greenhill set forth in this proxy\nstatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The TEGNA stockholders are\nencouraged to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety.\nGreenhill\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and\nfor the purposes of its evaluation of the Merger, was directed only to fairness from a financial point of view to the\nTEGNA stockholders of $24.00 in cash per share of TEGNA common stock and did not address any other aspect of\nthe Merger, including the Additional Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Greenhill expressed no\nopinion as to the fairness of the consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of TEGNA or as to the underlying decision by TEGNA to engage in the Merger. Greenhill\u2019s opinion\nwas approved by a fairness opinion committee. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any TEGNA\nstockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Greenhill, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available financial statements of TEGNA\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain other publicly available business and financial information relating to TEGNA\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain information, including financial forecasts and other financial and operating data,\nconcerning TEGNA supplied to or discussed with Greenhill by the management of TEGNA, including\nrelevant financial forecasts relating to TEGNA as prepared by the management of TEGNA and approved for\nGreenhill\u2019s use by TEGNA (the \u201cForecasts\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\ndiscussed the past and present operations and financial condition and the prospects of TEGNA with senior\nexecutives of TEGNA\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for TEGNA common stock and analyzed its\nimplied valuation multiples\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the consideration comprised of $24.00 in cash per share with values for TEGNA common stock\nderived based on the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain transactions that Greenhill\ndeemed relevant\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared $24.00 in cash per share of TEGNA common stock with values for TEGNA common stock derived\nbased on certain financial information and trading valuations of certain publicly traded companies that\nGreenhill deemed relevant\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared $24.00 in cash per share of TEGNA common stock to present values for TEGNA common stock\nderived by discounting future cash flows and a terminal value for TEGNA at discount rates Greenhill\ndeemed appropriate\u037e\n\u2022\nparticipated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of TEGNA and its legal advisors\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Greenhill deemed appropriate.\n52TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn giving its opinion, Greenhill assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the information and data publicly available, supplied or otherwise made available to, or reviewed by\nor discussed with, Greenhill by TEGNA management. With respect to the Forecasts, Greenhill assumed that they were\nreasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and good-faith judgments of TEGNA\nmanagement, and Greenhill relied upon the Forecasts in arriving at Greenhill\u2019s opinion. Greenhill expressed no opinion\nwith respect to the Forecasts or the assumptions upon which they are based. Greenhill did not make any independent\nevaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of TEGNA, nor was Greenhill furnished\nwith any such evaluation or appraisal. Greenhill assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with\nthe terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, and without waiver or modification of any terms or conditions the effect\nof which would be in any way meaningful to Greenhill\u2019s analysis. Greenhill further assumed that all governmental,\nregulatory and other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without\nany effect on TEGNA or the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Greenhill is not a legal, regulatory,\naccounting or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by TEGNA and the Parent and their respective advisors\nwith respect to such issues. Greenhill\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other\nconditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Greenhill as of, February 22, 2022. It should be\nunderstood that subsequent developments may affect Greenhill\u2019s opinion, and Greenhill does not have any\nobligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nThe projections furnished to Greenhill were prepared by TEGNA management. TEGNA does not publicly disclose\ninternal long-term forecasts or projections of the type provided to Greenhill in connection with Greenhill\u2019s analysis of\nthe Merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These projections were\nbased on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of\nTEGNA management, including, without limitation, the effect of regulatory, political and macroeconomic factors\nwhich are inherently difficult to project. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in\nsuch projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking statements, please\nrefer to the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Management Projections.\u201d\nGreenhill\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to Greenhill as of, the date of such opinion. Greenhill\u2019s opinion noted that subsequent\ndevelopments may affect Greenhill\u2019s opinion and that Greenhill does not have any obligation to update, revise or\nreaffirm such opinion. Greenhill\u2019s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the $24.00 in\ncash per share of TEGNA common stock to be paid to TEGNA\u2019s common stockholders in the Merger, and Greenhill\nexpressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors\nor other constituencies of TEGNA or the underlying decision by TEGNA to engage in the Merger. Furthermore,\nGreenhill expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or\nemployees of any party to the Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the $24.00 in cash per share of TEGNA\ncommon stock in the Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. Greenhill expressed no\nopinion as to the price at which TEGNA common stock will trade at any future time. In addition, Greenhill expressed\nno opinion on the Additional Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement).\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement were determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between TEGNA and Parent,\nand the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board of Directors. The opinion and\nfinancial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Board of Directors in its evaluation of the\nMerger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board of Directors or management of TEGNA\nwith respect to the Merger or the Per Share Merger Consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, Greenhill employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the Board of Directors on February 21, 2022 and in the presentation delivered\nto the Board of Directors on such date. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the\nfinancial analyses used by Greenhill, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering\nthe data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the\nmethodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Greenhill\u2019s\nanalyses.\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

            "text": "Summary of Greenhill\u2019s Financial Analysis\nPeer Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, Greenhill compared selected financial data of TEGNA\nwith similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which Greenhill judged to be\nsufficiently analogous to TEGNA. The companies selected by Greenhill were:\n\u2022\nNexstar Media Group, Inc. (\u201cNexstar\u201d)\n\u2022\nE.W. Scripps Company (\u201cScripps\u201d)\n\u2022\nGray Television, Inc. (\u201cGray\u201d)\nThese companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations\nand businesses that, for purposes of Greenhill\u2019s analysis, may be considered sufficiently similar to those of TEGNA\nbased on business sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics. None of the selected\ncompanies reviewed is identical to TEGNA. Certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially\ndifferent from those of TEGNA. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning\ndifferences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect\nthe companies differently than they would affect TEGNA.\nUsing information obtained from the selected companies\u2019 public filings, Wall Street research analyst estimates\navailable as of February 18, 2022 and FactSet Research Systems, Greenhill calculated for each selected company the\nratio of such company\u2019s enterprise value (calculated as the market value of the applicable company\u2019s common stock\non a fully diluted basis, plus any debt, minority interest and capitalized leases, less cash and cash equivalents) to (i)\nan average of 2021 and 2022 Consensus Adj. EBITDA (defined as the consensus equity research analyst estimate for\nsuch company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for various non-recurring\nitems), which Greenhill refers to as the 2021E-2022E EV/Avg. Adj. EBITDA and (ii) an average of 2022 and 2023\nConsensus Adj. EBITDA, which Greenhill refers to as the 2022E-2023E EV/Avg. Adj. EBITDA.

Adj. EBITDA multiple reference range for TEGNA of 7.5x to\n8.5x and (ii) a 2022E-2023E EV/Avg. Adj. EBITDA multiple reference range for TEGNA of 7.0x. to 8.0x. After applying\nsuch range to the consensus forecasts of the estimates from publicly available research (the \u201cConsensus Estimates\nCase\u201d), the Base Case and the Weighted Sensitivity Case (each of the Base Case and the Weighted Sensitivity Case,\nas summarized in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Management Projections\u201d), the analysis indicated\nranges of implied per share equity values as follows:\nAdj.

Using publicly available information, Greenhill examined selected\ntransactions involving companies which Greenhill judged to be sufficiently analogous to the business of TEGNA\n54TABLE OF CONTENTS\nor aspects thereof. For each of the selected transactions, Greenhill calculated the multiple of the enterprise value of\nthe target company in such transaction as a multiple of the two-year average EBITDA,1 which Greenhill refers to as\nSeller EV/Avg.

Certain of these transactions may have\ncharacteristics that are materially different from those of the Merger. However, the transactions selected were chosen\nbecause the participants in and certain other aspects of the transactions, for purposes of Greenhill\u2019s analysis, may be\nconsidered similar to the participants in and aspects of the Merger. The analyses necessarily involved complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies\ninvolved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the Merger.\nBased on the results of this analysis and other factors that Greenhill considered appropriate, Greenhill selected a\nmultiple reference range of 8.0x to 9.0x for the average adjusted EBITDA in 2021 and 2022 and 8.5x to 9.5x for the\naverage adjusted EBITDA in years 2020 and 2021. After applying such range to each of the cases listed below, the\nanalysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the common stock of TEGNA as follows:\n8.0x - 9.0x\n8.5x - 9.5x\n2020-21A Avg.

Greenhill conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining\nthe fully diluted equity value per share for TEGNA common stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of\nevaluating an asset using estimates of the future cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the\ntime value of money with respect to those cash flows by calculating the current value of the cash flows generated by\nthe asset, which we refer to as the present value and which is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the\npresent using a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the\nopportunity cost of capital and other appropriate factors. The present value of all future cash flows generated by the\nasset for periods beyond the projections period is referred to as terminal value.\nGreenhill conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity\nvalue per share for TEGNA common stock. Greenhill calculated the unlevered free cash flows that TEGNA is expected\nto generate during fiscal years 2022E and 2023E based upon the following sets of Forecasts: the Consensus\nEstimates Case, the Base Case, the Weighted Sensitivity, the Pessimistic Case and the Optimistic Case, respectively\n(each of the Base Case, the Weighted Sensitivity Case, the Pessimistic Case and the Optimistic Case, as summarized\nin the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Management Projections\u201d).\nGreenhill also calculated a terminal value for TEGNA at the end of this period by applying a range of exit multiples of\n7.0x to 8.0x to the average of the projected EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 using these same sets of Forecasts. Greenhill\nselected this range of exit multiples based on Greenhill\u2019s professional judgment and experience. Greenhill then\ndiscounted the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values to present value as of December\n31, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.00% to 9.00% for TEGNA. Then, Greenhill subtracted net debt,\nredeemable noncontrolling interests and unfunded pension liability and added equity investments to derive an\nimplied equity value, which it then divided by the number of fully diluted shares, as provided by management of\nTEGNA, to obtain a range of implied equity values per share as follows:\nRange\nConsensus Estimates Case\n$21.57 to $26.47\nWeighted Sensitivity\n$21.61 to $26.51\nBase Case\n$23.19 to $28.30\nPessimistic Case\n$13.55 to $17.36\nOptimistic Case\n$28.74 to $34.59\nOther Information",

For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill\ncalculated a range of the present values of future share prices using the multiple reference range of 7.0x to 8.0x based\non the ratio of enterprise value to average 2022-23E Weighted Sensitivity Case EBITDA and a 12.3% cost of equity.\nBased on the foregoing, Greenhill noted that the range of such present values of future shares price was $22.09 to\n$26.54 per share of TEGNA common stock.\nPrecedent Premiums Paid. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill calculated a\nrange of implied share prices by applying a range of precedent premiums paid from 25% to 35% to the unaffected\nclosing price of TEGNA common stock of $17.26 as of September 14, 2021. Based on the foregoing, Greenhill noted\nthat the range of implied prices per share was $21.58 to $23.30 per share of TEGNA common stock.\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill\nreviewed certain equity research analyst price targets for TEGNA common stock between TEGNA\u2019s Q2\u201921 earnings\nrelease on August 9, 2021 and September 14, 2021. Greenhill noted that the range of such price targets was $20.00 to\n$24.00 per share of TEGNA common stock.\n52-Week Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill\nreviewed the trading range for TEGNA common stock for the trailing 52-week period as of September 14, 2021.\nGreenhill noted that the low and high closing share prices during this period were $11.26 and $21.52 per share of\nTEGNA common stock, respectively.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses or data presented by Greenhill. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process\nand is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Greenhill believes\n56TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the\nforegoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete\nview of the processes underlying the analyses and its fairness opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting\nfrom any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of Greenhill with respect to the actual value of TEGNA.\nThe order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by\nGreenhill. In arriving at its opinion, Greenhill did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors\nconsidered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative),\nconsidered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, Greenhill considered the totality of the\nfactors and analyses performed in determining its opinion. Accordingly, Greenhill believes that the summary set forth\nabove and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions thereof, without considering all of\nits analyses, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by\nGreenhill are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, Greenhill\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected\ncompanies reviewed as described in the summary of the peer trading multiples analysis or the precedent transaction\nmultiples analysis is identical to TEGNA, and none of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger.\nHowever, the companies for the peer trading multiples analysis were selected because they are publicly traded\ncompanies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of Greenhill\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to\nthose of TEGNA. The transactions selected for the precedent transaction multiples analysis were similarly chosen\nbecause their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of Greenhill\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to\nthe Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in\nfinancial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies\ncompared to TEGNA and the transactions compared to the Merger.\nGreenhill is an internationally recognized investment banking firm regularly engaged in providing financial advisory\nservices in connection with mergers and acquisitions. TEGNA selected Greenhill as its financial advisor in connection\nwith the Merger on the basis of Greenhill\u2019s experience in similar transactions, its reputation in the investment banking\ncommunity and its familiarity with the media sector.\nFor services rendered in connection with the Merger and the delivery of the opinion, TEGNA has agreed to pay\nGreenhill a fee of $12,000,000, of which $2,000,000 became payable upon delivery of Greenhill\u2019s fairness opinion and\nthe remainder of which is contingent and payable only upon the completion of the Merger. In addition, TEGNA has\nagreed to reimburse Greenhill for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and\ndisbursements of counsel, and will indemnify Greenhill against certain liabilities arising out of Greenhill\u2019s\nengagement. During the two years preceding the date of Greenhill\u2019s opinion, Greenhill has not been engaged by,\nperformed any services for or received any compensation from TEGNA, Parent, Merger Sub, Standard General,\nApollo, the other Parent Restructuring Entities or their respective affiliates, other than the compensation that was\npaid to Greenhill under the letter agreements pursuant to which Greenhill was retained as a financial advisor to\nTEGNA in connection with the Merger. In the two years preceding the date of Greenhill\u2019s opinion, Greenhill has been\nengaged by certain affiliates of Apollo and Ares Management to provide financial advisory services\u037e however, no\ntransactions have ensued, and Greenhill has not received any compensation for its engagements from either Apollo\nor Ares Management or their affiliates.\nManagement Projections",

            "text": "Management Projections\nExcept for a financial outlook with respect to the current fiscal quarter and year issued in connection with its ordinary\ncourse earnings announcements, TEGNA, like its broadcast peers, does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose\nlong-term forecasts or projections as to future performance, earnings or other results. This is the result of the\nhistorically unpredictable nature of the TEGNA business, including the effect of regulatory, political and\nmacroeconomic factors which are inherently difficult to project. In order to help develop a framework of evaluating\nthe potential future value of TEGNA, TEGNA\u2019s management prepared a certain nonpublic, unaudited prospective\nfinancial outlook for fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023 (the \u201cBase Case\u201d), based on,\n57TABLE OF CONTENTS\nin part, TEGNA\u2019s most recent actual and projected results, including TEGNA\u2019s financial performance throughout 2021.\nThe Base Case was prepared without giving effect to any incremental acquisitions or investments. The Base Case\nwas made available to, and approved by, the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger\nAgreement and the Merger. The Base Case (other than the unlevered free cash flow calculations) was also made\navailable to Parent and its affiliates at Parent\u2019s request in connection with their due diligence review of a potential\ntransaction with TEGNA.\nGiven the unpredictability of the macroeconomic environment, including regulatory factors and the impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, TEGNA\u2019s management also prepared for the consideration of the Board of Directors two\nadditional nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information cases for TEGNA using a range of different\nassumptions, which cases, together with the Base Case, were made available to, and approved by, the Board of\nDirectors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the Base Per Share Merger Consideration. These cases\nleverage the Base Case with the following variations in order to reflect a range of outcomes:\n\u2022\nOptimistic Sensitivity Case: A variation of the Base Case that reflects increased revenue growth as a result\nof faster-than-expected economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, industry improvements, increased\nviewership and deceleration of net subscriber losses, and favorable regulatory outcomes.\n\u2022\nPessimistic Sensitivity Case: A variation of the Base Case that reflects decreased revenue as a result of\nslower economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced advertising revenue, declining viewership\nand acceleration of net subscriber losses, and regulatory constraints.\nAfter reviewing and discussing the Base Case, Optimistic Sensitivity Case and Pessimistic Sensitivity Case, the\nBoard of Directors determined that J.P. Morgan and Greenhill should apply a 60%, 15% and 25% weighting to the\nBase Case, the Optimistic Sensitivity Case and the Pessimistic Sensitivity Case, respectively (such weighted blend,\nthe \u201cWeighted Sensitivity Case\u201d and together with the Base Case, the Optimistic Sensitivity Case and the Pessimistic\nSensitivity Case, the \u201cCases\u201d), in performing their respective financial analyses of the Base Per Share Merger\nConsideration to be paid to TEGNA stockholders in connection with the Merger, which financial analyses were\npresented to the Board of Directors by J.P. Morgan and Greenhill, respectively, and are summarized in the sections of\nthis proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\u201d and \u201c-Opinion of Greenhill & Co., LLC,\u201d\nrespectively. The Weighted Sensitivity Case was also reviewed by TEGNA\u2019s management, J.P.

Morgan and Greenhill in connection\nwith their respective discounted cash flow analyses, using the financial information provided by TEGNA, as Adjusted EBITDA (as\nshown in the table above) further adjusted by deducting payments made for (i) taxes (estimated cash tax expense on an unlevered\nbasis), (ii) purchases of property and equipment, (iii) changes in net working capital, and, in the case of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis,\n(iv) syndicated programming payment, net of syndicated programming amortization.\n(3)\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s and Greenhill\u2019s respective valuation analysis utilizing Unlevered Free Cash Flow differed with respect to their\ntreatment of the Company\u2019s syndicated programming amortization and payments as reflected in clause (iv) of footnote 2 above.\nIn J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, actual syndicated programming payment amounts were included in the Unlevered Free Cash Flow\ncalculation, while in Greenhill\u2019s analysis the amortizations related to such payments, which closely approximate the actual\npayments, were utilized. This resulted in J.P. Morgan\u2019s and Greenhill\u2019s respective analysis utilizing the Base Case, Optimistic\nSensitivity Case, Pessimistic Sensitivity Case and Weighted Sensitivity Case being inconsistent. The amounts in the table for Base\nCase, Optimistic Sensitivity Case, Pessimistic Sensitivity Case and Weighted Sensitivity Case reflect the metrics used only in\nGreenhill\u2019s valuation analysis. J.P. Morgan\u2019s valuation analysis utilized the Base Case, Optimistic Sensitivity Case, Pessimistic\nSensitivity Case and Weighted Sensitivity Case as follows:\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow\n(in millions)\n2022E\n2023E\nBase Case\n$946\n$644\nOptimistic Sensitivity Case\n$1,034\n$818\nPessimistic Sensitivity Case\n$736\n$399\nWeighted Sensitivity Case\n$907\n$609\n(4)\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s valuation analysis also utilized prospective Levered Free Cash Flow for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.\n\u201cLevered Free Cash Flow\u201d is a non-GAAP financial measure which was calculated by J.P. Morgan in connection with its\ndiscounted cash flow analysis, using the financial information provided by TEGNA, as Unlevered Free Cash Flow (as shown in the\ntable above) further adjusted as follows: plus (i) taxes (estimated cash tax expense on an unlevered basis), plus (ii) non-cash stock\nbased compensation, minus (iii) cash net interest expense, minus (iv) taxes (estimated cash taxes on a levered basis), plus (v)\nsyndicated programming payments, net of amortization.\nTEGNA\u2019s management also provided unaudited revenue and unaudited Adjusted EBITDA of TEGNA for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2021 to the Board of Directors and to Standard General, and the unaudited unlevered free\ncash flows of TEGNA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 to the Board of Directors, which information is\nsummarized below:\n(in millions)\n2021A\nRevenue\n$2,992\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$948\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(2)\n$600\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Levered Free Cash Flow to net income for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2021 presented in accordance with GAAP is presented below:\n(in millions)\nYear ended \nDec. 31,\n2021\nNet income attributable to TEGNA Inc.

Morgan\u2019s valuation analysis due to\nthe effect of Greenhill\u2019s exclusions referenced in footnote 5 above.\n(8)\nEstimated cash net interest expense calculated as the sum of: (i) the average outstanding debt balance of the revolving credit\nfacility multiplied by its interest rate plus estimated fees for the undrawn commitments, (ii) the average outstanding debt balance\nof each unsecured note tranche multiplied by its respective interest rates, and (iii) the average outstanding cash balance multiplied\nby estimated cash interest income rate.\n(9)\nEstimated levered cash taxes calculated as Adjusted EBIT (non-GAAP basis) less estimated cash net interest expense, multiplied\nby estimated marginal cash tax rate.\n(10) Not used for purposes of Greenhill\u2019s analysis, calculated for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis only.\nThe Cases were developed by TEGNA management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any other M&A or changes to capital allocation.\nFurthermore, the Cases do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Although\nthe Cases are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by\nTEGNA management with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and\nfinancial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to TEGNA\u2019s business, all of which are difficult\nor impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond TEGNA\u2019s control. The Cases constitute forward-\nlooking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom the results forecasted in the Cases, including, but not limited to, TEGNA\u2019s performance, industry performance,\ngeneral business and economic conditions, customer requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse changes in\napplicable laws, regulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, and the various\nrisks set forth in TEGNA\u2019s reports filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the Cases will be realized or that\nactual results will not be significantly higher or lower than the Cases. The Cases cover two years, and such\ninformation by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. In addition, the Cases will be affected by\nTEGNA\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Cases reflect\nassumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and cannot, therefore, be considered a\nguarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such. The inclusion of the\nCases should not be regarded as an indication that TEGNA, J.P. Morgan, Greenhill, their respective officers, directors,\naffiliates, advisors, or other representatives or anyone who received this information then considered, or now\nconsiders, them a reliable prediction of future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. The\ninclusion of the Cases in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Cases will be\nnecessarily predictive of actual future events. No representation is made by TEGNA or any other person regarding\nthe Cases or TEGNA\u2019s ultimate performance compared to such information. The Cases should be evaluated, if at all, in\nconjunction with the historical financial statements and other information about TEGNA contained in TEGNA\u2019s public\nfilings with the SEC. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can\nFind More Information.\u201d In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Cases, TEGNA\nstockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Cases.\n60\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Cases were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the\npublished guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or with GAAP, or the guidelines established by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information.\nThe prospective financial information, including the Cases, included in this proxy statement has been prepared by,\nand is the responsibility of, TEGNA\u2019s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed,\nexamined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to such prospective financial information and,\naccordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect\nthereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to\nTEGNA\u2019s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the prospective financial information and\nshould not be read to do so.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Levered Free Cash Flow are \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures,\u201d\nwhich are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP\nfinancial measures were relied upon by J.P. Morgan and Greenhill for purposes of their respective opinions and by the\nBoard of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a\nreconciliation of prospective non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to prospective\nnon-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the\nMerger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. Accordingly, TEGNA has not\nprovided a reconciliation of the prospective financial measures included in the Cases to the relevant GAAP financial\nmeasures. However, reconciliations of historical, actual non-GAAP financial measures are provided above.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by J.P. Morgan and Greenhill for purposes of\ntheir respective opinions or by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented\nin compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by TEGNA may not be comparable to similarly\ntitled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures\nbecause they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly,\nthese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial\nmeasures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe summary of such information above is included solely to give TEGNA stockholders access to the information\nthat was made available to the Board of Directors, J.P. Morgan, Greenhill, and Parent and its affiliates (in the case of\nParent and its affiliates, such information excluded Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Levered Free Cash Flow), and is\nnot included in this proxy statement in order to influence any TEGNA stockholder to make any investment decision\nwith respect to the Merger or the Merger Agreement, including whether or not to approve the Merger Agreement\nProposal or to seek appraisal rights with respect to their shares of TEGNA common stock. In addition, neither the\nCases nor any other financial information included in this proxy statement have been updated or revised to reflect\ninformation or results after the date they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as\nrequired by applicable securities laws, TEGNA does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Cases or any other\nfinancial information to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future\nevents, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.\nInterests of TEGNA\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger",

Based on the assumptions described above in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-Certain Assumptions,\u201d the estimated aggregate value of the unvested TEGNA equity awards held by\nTEGNA\u2019s nonemployee directors is $441,551.\nTreatment of Annual Bonus\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, TEGNA will provide to each TEGNA employee (including each of the\nnamed executive officers) who is eligible to participate in a TEGNA annual bonus program, a prorated portion of the\nannual bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the Closing that occurs prior to the Closing, which bonus will\nbe determined based on the greater of (a) the employee\u2019s target annual bonus for such year and (b) the employee\u2019s\nannual bonus amount for such year determined based on actual performance results through the Closing.\nSee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA\u2019s\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated amount of the prorated bonus payment\nthat each of TEGNA\u2019s named executive officers would receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nExecutive Change in Control Severance Arrangements\nTEGNA maintains the TEGNA 2015 Change in Control Severance Plan (the \u201cCIC Severance Plan\u201d), which provides\nseverance benefits for its participants upon a change in control of TEGNA. Mr. Lougee is the only executive officer\nwho participates in the CIC Severance Plan. Under the CIC Severance Plan, a participant would be eligible for\nseverance benefits if the participant\u2019s employment is terminated by TEGNA without \u201ccause,\u201d or due to the\nparticipant\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason,\u201d in either case, on or within two years following a change in control of\nTEGNA, or prior to a change in control if the termination occurs in connection with such change in control, subject to\nthe participant\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a release agreement.\nThe severance benefits under the CIC Severance Plan are (a) a cash severance payment equal to three times the sum\nof (i) the participant\u2019s highest rate of annual salary during the 12-month period immediately before the change in\ncontrol or immediately before the date of termination, whichever is greater, and (ii) the average annual bonus the\nparticipant earned with respect to the three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the change in\ncontrol occurs or immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs, whichever is greater\u037e (b)\na prorated annual bonus calculated based on the average annual bonus the participant earned with respect to the\nthree fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs\u037e and (c) the monthly\nCOBRA cost of the participant\u2019s medical and dental coverage in effect as of the date of termination multiplied by the\nlesser of (i) 18 and (ii) 24 minus the number of full months between the date of the change in control and the date of\ntermination.\nTEGNA also maintains the TEGNA Transitional Compensation Plan (the \u201cTCP\u201d), a legacy change-in-control plan that\nprovides severance protections for its participants upon a change in control of TEGNA. All of TEGNA\u2019s executive\nofficers other than Mr. Lougee participate in the TCP. Under the TCP, a participant would be eligible for severance\nbenefits if the participant\u2019s employment is terminated by TEGNA without \u201ccause,\u201d or due to the participant\u2019s\nresignation for \u201cgood reason,\u201d in either case, on or within two years following a change in control of TEGNA, or prior\nto a change in control if the termination occurs in connection with such change in control. In addition the TCP\nentitles Ms. Beall and Mr. Harrison to severance benefits upon a resignation without good reason during a 30-day\nwindow period beginning on the first anniversary of the change in control.\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe severance benefits under the TCP are (a) a cash severance payment equal to three times (or in the case of Ms.\nHarker, two times) the sum of (i) the participant\u2019s highest rate of annual salary during the 12-month period (plus\ncertain other compensation included in the participant\u2019s income for income tax purposes during such 12-month\nperiod) immediately before the change in control or immediately before the date of termination, whichever is greater,\nand (ii) the highest annual bonus earned with respect to the three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in\nwhich the change in control occurs or the highest annual bonus earned with respect to any fiscal year during the\nperiod between the change in control and the date of termination, whichever is greater\u037e (b) a prorated annual bonus\ncalculated based on the highest annual bonus the participant earned with respect to the three fiscal years\nimmediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs\u037e (c) continuation of life insurance coverage\nand medical benefits for three years (or in the case of Ms. Harker, two years)\u037e and (d) for each of Ms. Beall and Mr.\nHarrison, a lump-sum payment in an amount determined based upon the retirement plan benefits and supplemental\nexecutive retirement plan benefits the participant would have received if participant had remained employed by the\nCompany during the applicable severance period.\nIf the compensation and benefits payable to an executive officer would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999\nof the Internal Revenue Code, (a) in the case of Mr. Lougee and Ms. Harker, such amounts shall either be paid in full\nor reduced to the level that would avoid application of the excise tax, whichever would place the executive officer in a\nbetter after-tax position\u037e and (b) each of Ms. Beall and Mr. Harrison would receive a make-whole payment, which\nwould generally place such executive officer in the same after-tax position that he or she would have been in if the\nexcise tax did not apply.\nSee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA\u2019s\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated amounts that each of TEGNA\u2019s named\nexecutive officers would receive under the applicable change-in-control arrangement upon a qualifying termination of\nemployment following a change in control of TEGNA.\nRetirement Plans\nTEGNA maintains the TEGNA Supplemental Retirement Plan (\u201cSERP\u201d), which is a nonqualified defined benefit\npension plan maintained for the benefit of designated U.S.-based management or highly compensated employees\nwhose benefits under TEGNA\u2019s tax-qualified defined benefit plan, the TEGNA Retirement Plan (\u201cTRP\u201d), are limited by\nIRS limitations on amounts that may be paid from a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. All of TEGNA\u2019s\nexecutive officers participate in both the TRP and the SERP, other than Ms. Harker, who does not participate in any\ndefined benefit plan. Each executive officer who participates in the TRP is already fully vested in his or her TRP\nbenefits.\nGenerally, a participant must complete five years of service and attain the age of 55 to become 100% vested in his or\nher benefits under the SERP. Each of the executive officers who participate in the SERP is already fully vested in his or\nher SERP benefits, other than Mr. Harrison. In accordance with the rules under the SERP, Mr. Harrison\u2019s SERP benefits\nwill become fully vested upon a change in control.\nSee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA\u2019s\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated value of the accelerated benefits that Mr.\nHarrison would receive under the SERP upon a change in control of TEGNA.\nPotential Employment Arrangements with Parent\nAny of TEGNA\u2019s executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide\nservices to Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, prior to, on or following the Closing, enter into new\ncompensation arrangements with Parent or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no new\nindividualized compensation arrangements between TEGNA\u2019s executive officers and Parent or the Surviving\nCorporation have been established.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, TEGNA\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain\nongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six years following the effective time under directors\u2019 and\nofficers\u2019 liability insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation. This indemnification and insurance coverage is\nfurther described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Indemnification and\nInsurance.\u201d\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the\nMerger\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-K, which\nrequires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of TEGNA that is\nbased on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger.

            "text": "Appraisal Rights\nIf the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold shares of TEGNA common stock through the\nEffective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand\nappraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights of appraisal will be\nentitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL (\u201cSection\n262\u201d). The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL\nand is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and\nincorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not\nconstitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in\nSection 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of TEGNA common stock\nunless otherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of TEGNA common stock is entitled to\ndemand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of\nTEGNA common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker, trust or other nominee,\nmust act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to\nperfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of TEGNA common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee\nand you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, TEGNA stockholders who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of\ntheir shares\u037e (ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) continuously are the record\nholders of such shares through the Effective Time\u037e and (iv) otherwise exactly follow the procedures\n69TABLE OF CONTENTS\nset forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to\nreceive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of TEGNA common stock, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount\ndetermined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have asserted appraisal\nrights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1%\nof the outstanding shares of TEGNA common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or\n(b) the value of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of TEGNA common stock for\nwhich appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the\n\u201cownership thresholds\u201d). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good\ncause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the\ndate the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from\ntime to time during such period. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the\nappraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an\namount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of\nsuch payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d\nof the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of\nsuch voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make\nsuch voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the\nrecord date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal\nrights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes TEGNA\u2019s notice\nto stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with the Merger, any TEGNA stockholder who wishes to\nexercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex D carefully.\nFailure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of\nappraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the\nPer Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the\nprocedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of TEGNA common stock, TEGNA believes that if a\nstockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of TEGNA common stock must do ALL\nof the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to TEGNA a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the\nMerger Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the\nEffective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the\nEffective Time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of TEGNA common stock held either\nin a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition\nin the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120\ndays after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has\nno intention of doing so.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote\nagainst the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFiling Written Demand\nAny TEGNA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to TEGNA, before the vote on the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will\nbe submitted to stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares, and that stockholder\nmust not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A TEGNA stockholder exercising\nappraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must\ncontinue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain\nvoting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will\nconstitute a waiver of the TEGNA stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written\ndemand for appraisal. Therefore, a TEGNA stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain\nfrom voting, or otherwise fail to vote, on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262.\nThe written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A\nTEGNA stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement at the Special Meeting of TEGNA stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of TEGNA common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares\nregistered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of TEGNA common stock must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform TEGNA of the identity of the holder and\nstate that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the Merger. If the\nshares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such\ndemand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than\none person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint\nowners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for\nappraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly\ndisclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nTEGNA STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER\nNOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR\nBANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES\nFOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES.\nA PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER\nPERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD\nHOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nTEGNA Inc.\nAttention: General Counsel\n8350 Broad Street, Suite 2000\nTysons, Virginia 22102\nAny TEGNA stockholder who has delivered a written demand to TEGNA and who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept\nthe Per Share Merger Consideration by delivering to TEGNA a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.\nHowever, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require\nwritten approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be\ndismissed as to any TEGNA stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval\nmay be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this\nshall not affect the right of any TEGNA stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the Per Share\nMerger Consideration within 60 days after the\n71\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEffective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced and TEGNA, as the Surviving Corporation, does not\napprove a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any\nTEGNA stockholder who withdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately\npreceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding\nwith respect to a TEGNA stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined\nin any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the Per Share Merger\nConsideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each TEGNA\nstockholder who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in\nfavor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any TEGNA stockholder\nwho has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any\nbeneficial owner of the relevant shares) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a TEGNA\nstockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting\nTEGNA stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present\nintention, to file a petition, and TEGNA stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a\npetition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of TEGNA common stock.\nAccordingly, any TEGNA stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action\nto perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of TEGNA common stock within the time and in the manner\nprescribed in Section 262. The failure of a TEGNA stockholder to file such a petition within the period specified in\nSection 262 could nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any TEGNA stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section\n262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nSurviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and with respect to which TEGNA has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting TEGNA\nstockholder within 10 days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or\nwithin 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial\nowner of shares of TEGNA common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may,\nin such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing\nstatements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a TEGNA stockholder and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving\nCorporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the\nDelaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all TEGNA stockholders\nwho have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not\nbeen reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time\nand place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the TEGNA\nstockholders shown on the written statement described above at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also\nbe published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the\nCity of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne\nby the Surviving Corporation. After notice to TEGNA stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of\nChancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those TEGNA stockholders who have\ncomplied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of\nChancery may require TEGNA stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates\n(if any) to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any\nTEGNA stockholder fails to comply with the\n72\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndirection, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of\nChancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all TEGNA stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights if\nneither of the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of \u201cFair Value\u201d\nAfter determining the TEGNA stockholders entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above has been satisfied as to TEGNA stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will\nbe conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of the shares of TEGNA common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In\ndetermining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in\nits discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of\npayment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date\nof payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the\nappraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each TEGNA stockholder entitled to appraisal an\namount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals\nthe difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at\nsuch time.\nIn Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which\nare generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts\nthat could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather\napplies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,\nthe Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual\ncircumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nTEGNA stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they\nwould receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an\ninvestment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is\nnot an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as\nto the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders\nshould recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same\nas, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Neither TEGNA nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share\nMerger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of TEGNA and Parent reserves the\nrights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of TEGNA common stock is less than the Per\nShare Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above has been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will\ncease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of\nexperts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court\nof Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a TEGNA stockholder, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with\nan\n73\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nappraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts,\nbe charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination\nor assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any TEGNA stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of TEGNA common stock under Section\n262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of\nTEGNA common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per\nShare Merger Consideration. A TEGNA stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, such holder\u2019s\nright to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if neither of the\nownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to TEGNA stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the\nstockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of such holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an\nacceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no TEGNA stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote\nsuch shares of TEGNA common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on\nthe stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of TEGNA common stock, if any, payable to\nTEGNA stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the\nownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to the TEGNA stockholders seeking appraisal rights, or\nif the TEGNA stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal\nand an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval\nof the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for\nappraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to\nany TEGNA stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms\nas the court deems just\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any TEGNA stockholder\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the\nEffective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any TEGNA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged\nto consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger",

The lawsuit is\ncaptioned Wang v. TEGNA Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02513, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York. On March 29, 2022, another lawsuit was filed against the same defendants asserting similar\nclaims. The lawsuit is captioned O\u2019Dell v. TEGNA Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-02547, and is also pending in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York. On March 30, 2022, two additional lawsuits were filed against the\nsame defendants asserting similar claims\u037e the first lawsuit is captioned Waterman v. TEGNA Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-\n01789, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York\u037e the second lawsuit is captioned\nLandskroner v. TEGNA, Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-02611, and was pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York until it was voluntarily dismissed on April 1, 2022. In addition, on March 31, 2022, a fifth lawsuit\nwas filed against the same defendants bringing similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned Whitfield v. TEGNA Inc. et al.,\nNo. 2:22-cv-01247, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Finally, on April\n7, 2022, another lawsuit was filed against the same defendants, also asserting similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned\nNutkis v. TEGNA Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-02894, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York.\nThe complaints generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by TEGNA on March 25, 2022 in\nconnection with the Merger fails to disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of\nthe Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The alleged omissions relate to (i) certain financial\nprojections of TEGNA, (ii) certain financial analyses of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill, (iii) the financial\n74TABLE OF CONTENTS\nbenefits to TEGNA executives and members of the Board of Directors from the Merger and (iv) certain statements\nconcerning the sales process. Plaintiffs generally seek, among other things, to enjoin TEGNA from consummating the\nMerger, or in the alternative, rescission of the Merger and/or compensatory damages, as well as attorney\u2019s fees.\nTEGNA believes that the allegations in the complaints are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising out of the\nMerger may also be filed in the future.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",

This discussion is limited to U.S.\nHolders who hold their shares of TEGNA common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the\nCode (generally, property held for investment). This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of\nthe Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and\nall of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.

In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations arising under the unearned income\nMedicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or any\nconsiderations in respect of any withholding required pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010\n(including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into in\nconnection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement).\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a\nbeneficial owner of shares of TEGNA common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such\npartnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and\ncertain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of TEGNA\ncommon stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY\nPARTICULAR STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR TAX\nCIRCUMSTANCES. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC\nTAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND\nOTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of TEGNA common stock that is\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the\nlaws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless\nof its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration\nof such trust and one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority\nto control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust validly elected to be treated as a United\nStates person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of TEGNA common stock pursuant to the Merger will be\na taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss\nin an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in the shares of TEGNA common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis\ngenerally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshares of TEGNA common stock. A U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of TEGNA common stock\ngenerally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if\nsuch U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger.\nLong-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax at preferential rates currently, which rates are subject to change. The deductibility of capital losses is\nsubject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of TEGNA common stock at different times or\ndifferent prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to\neach block of TEGNA common stock.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders in\nconnection with the Merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder\npursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed\nand executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that\nsuch U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise\ncomplies with the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup\nwithholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information\nis timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS BASED ON CURRENT LAW. LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL\nCHANGES OR INTERPRETATIONS, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE\nACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET FORTH THEREIN. THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL\nINFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH,\nOR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-\nINCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS\nARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

These approvals include clearances\nunder the HSR Act and the Communications Act and FCC rules.\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting periods applicable to the Merger and the\ntransactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement have expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable\nunder the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings\nof their HSR Act notification and report forms or the early termination of that waiting period. If the Federal Trade\nCommission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) issues a request for\nadditional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as the \u201cSecond Request\u201d) prior to the expiration\nof the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only\nafter the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier\nor the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period.\nThe parties made the required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on March 8, 2022. On April 11, 2022, the parties re-\nfiled their HSR filings to give the DOJ additional time to review the Merger.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution\nAgreement, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting periods under the HSR Act,\n77TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public\ninterest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the\nContribution Agreement, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or\nhold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the\ncompletion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, any state could take\nsuch action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could\ninclude seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution\nAgreement or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal\naction under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger and\nthe transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will\nprevail.\nFederal Communications Commission Consent\nTEGNA holds various licenses necessary for the operation of its broadcast television stations. These licenses are\ngranted by the FCC. The Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s rules require that, in connection with a change of\ncontrol of TEGNA, TEGNA and the transferee must make certain filings with the FCC. Under the Merger Agreement,\nit is a condition to each party\u2019s obligation to complete the Merger that the FCC grant the FCC Consent, which\nincludes the grant of applications to transfer control of TEGNA\u2019s licenses and a petition for declaratory ruling under\nSection 310(b)(4) of the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s rules governing foreign ownership. For more information,\nsee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Other Covenants-Efforts to Consummate\nthe Merger.\u201d\nThe FCC Applications involve a change of more than 50% of the voting rights representing ultimate control of\nTEGNA and its broadcast subsidiaries and thus will constitute a \u201csubstantial\u201d change in ownership or control of the\nTEGNA licensees within the meaning of the FCC\u2019s rules. Accordingly, the FCC must provide public notice for a\nperiod of 30 days prior to acting on the FCC Applications. During that period, interested parties, including members\nof the public, may file informal objections to, or petitions to deny, the FCC Applications. The filing of a petition to\ndeny or an informal objection could delay FCC processing of the FCC Applications.\nIn determining whether to approve the transfer of control of a television broadcast licensee or an assignment of\nlicense, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the proposed licensee, including compliance with\nvarious rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the licensee and those persons\nholding significant voting or positional interests in the licensee or in the entities controlling the licensee, the\nCommunications Act limitations on foreign ownership and control of broadcast licensees, and compliance with FCC\nrules and regulations. The timing or outcome of the FCC approval process cannot be predicted.\nThe parties have submitted the FCC Applications required to obtain the FCC Consent.\nRestructuring and Contribution Agreement",

This compensation is\nsummarized in the section captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Interests of TEGNA\u2019s\nExecutive Officers and Directors in the Merger.\u201d The Board of Directors encourages you to review carefully the\nnamed executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly,\nTEGNA is asking you to approve the following resolution:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the stockholders of TEGNA approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation that will\nor may become payable to TEGNA\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as\ndisclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger\nAgreement-Interests of TEGNA\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.\u201d\u201d\nThe vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Agreement\nProposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to approve this\nCompensation Proposal and vice versa.

Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the\ncompensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the\nvote on this Compensation Proposal.\nApproval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the\noutstanding shares of TEGNA common stock representing a majority of the outstanding shares present at the Special\nMeeting in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present, (i) a failure to vote in\nperson or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (ii)\nabstentions will be treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have the same effect as a vote against the Compensation\nProposal and (iii) broker \u201cnon-votes\u201d (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal.\nShares of TEGNA common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be\nvoted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon.
