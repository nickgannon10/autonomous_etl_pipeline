Upon valid termination of the\nmerger agreement under specified circumstances, Medallia will be required to pay Parent (or its designee) a\ntermination fee of $191,110,000. Specifically, this termination fee will be payable by Medallia to Parent if the merger\nagreement is terminated:\n\u2022\nby Parent, if the Medallia Board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nby Parent, if Medallia breaches or fails to perform, in accordance with the merger agreement, in any material\nrespects, its obligations under the alternative solicitation provisions in the merger agreement\u037e or\n\u2022\nby Medallia, if the Medallia Board authorizes the acceptance of a superior proposal.\nThe termination fee will also be payable in certain circumstances if:\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement is terminated (1) because the merger is not completed by the termination date\u037e (2)\nbecause of Medallia\u2019s failure to obtain the required approval of our stockholders\u037e or (3) subject to a 45-day\ncure period, because Medallia breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations,\nwarranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing conditions to not be satisfied\u037e\n\u2022\nprior to such termination (but after the date of the merger agreement) a proposal, generally speaking, to\nacquire at least 50 percent of Medallia\u2019s stock or assets is publicly announced or publicly disclosed by a\nthird party and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned\u037e and\n\u2022\nMedallia subsequently consummates, or enters into a definitive agreement providing for, a transaction\ninvolving the acquisition of at least 50 percent of its stock or assets within one year of such termination.\nNotwithstanding the above, under certain circumstances as described in the merger agreement, if Medallia terminates\nthe merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal with a specified party, then the amount of the termination fee\npayable to Parent will be $95,550,000.\nUpon termination of the merger agreement under other specified circumstances, Parent will be required to pay\nMedallia a termination fee of $382,220,000, the payment of which has been guaranteed pursuant to and subject to the\nterms and conditions of the limited guaranty. Specifically, the termination fee will be payable by Parent to Medallia if\nthe merger agreement is terminated:\n\u2022\nsubject to a 45-day cure period, by Medallia, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform in any\nmaterial respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the\nrelated closing conditions to not be satisfied\u037e or\n\u2022\nby Medallia, if Parent failed to consummate the merger as required pursuant to, and in the circumstances\nspecified in, the merger agreement.\nIn certain instances, Parent can elect to delay the closing of the merger to November 1, 2021. If Parent does so and\ndoes not close the merger on or before November 1, 2021, then the termination fee payable by Parent will be\n$445,920,000.\nThe merger agreement also provides that Medallia, on one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may\nspecifically enforce the obligations under the merger agreement, except that Medallia may only cause Parent and\nMerger Sub to consummate the merger, and the Thoma Bravo Fund to provide equity financing pursuant to the\nequity commitment letter, if certain conditions are satisfied, including the funding or availability of the debt financing.\nNeither Parent nor Medallia is required to pay to the other its termination fee on more than one occasion.\nLimited Guaranty",

Under the merger agreement,\nParent will acquire Medallia for $34.00 in cash per share of our common stock. In order to complete the merger,\nour stockholders representing a majority of all issued and outstanding common stock must vote to adopt the\nmerger agreement at the special meeting. This approval is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the\nMerger.\u201d The Medallia Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares\nof our common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies of our stockholders to be voted at the special\nmeeting.\nThis proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the\nmerger agreement, the special meeting and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed\nmaterials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock without attending the special\nmeeting and to ensure that your shares of our common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.\nYour vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy\nas soon as possible.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Medallia?\nA:\nThe proposed merger is the acquisition of Medallia by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is\napproved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or\nwaived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Medallia, with Medallia continuing as the surviving corporation.\nAs a result of the merger, Medallia will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and our common stock will\nno longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE. In addition, our common stock will be\nderegistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $34.00 in cash, without interest and less any\napplicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock that you own, unless you have properly\nexercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under the DGCL, and certain\nother conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of our common stock, you will\nreceive $3,400.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock, without interest and less any\napplicable withholding taxes.\nQ:\nHow does the per share price compare to the market price of Medallia\u2019s common stock?\nA:\nThis amount constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 20 percent to the closing price of our common stock on\nJune 10, 2021, which was the last full trading day before public speculation that Medallia was pursuing a sale\u037e\nand (2) a premium of approximately 29 percent to Medallia\u2019s unaffected 30-day price average.\n15TABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat will happen to Medallia equity-based awards and Medallia options?\nA:\nGenerally speaking, Medallia equity-based awards and Medallia options will be treated as follows:\n\u2022\nVested Medallia equity-based awards will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in\ncash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the per share price and (2) the total number of shares of\nour common stock then-subject to such Medallia equity-based award. This amount (less any required\nwithholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of\nthe merger.\n\u2022\nUnvested Medallia equity-based awards will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount\nin cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the per share price and (2) the total number of shares of\nour common stock then-subject to such unvested Medallia equity-based award. Subject to the holder\u2019s\ncontinued service with Parent and its representatives through the applicable vesting dates, these unvested\ncash amounts will vest and be payable (less any required withholding and other taxes) pursuant to the\ncorresponding unvested Medallia equity-based award\u2019s vesting schedule. For unvested Medallia equity-\nbased awards that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions that remain unsatisfied as of the\neffective time of the merger, the performance metrics of such awards will be deemed achieved at a specified\nlevel of achievement, and the corresponding cash amount will vest and be paid out in lump sum at the end\nof the original award\u2019s performance period, subject to the holder\u2019s continued service.\n\u2022\nVested Medallia options will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without\ninterest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price per share\nof such option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon exercise in full of\nsuch vested Medallia option. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to\nthe applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the merger.\n\u2022\nUnvested Medallia options will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash,\nwithout interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price\nper share of such option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon exercise in\nfull of such unvested Medallia option. Subject to the holder\u2019s continued service with Parent and its\nrepresentatives through the applicable vesting dates, these unvested cash amounts will vest and be\npayable (less any required withholding and other taxes) pursuant to the corresponding unvested Medallia\noption\u2019s vesting schedule.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to the ESPP?\nA:\nGenerally speaking, the ESPP will be treated as follows:\n\u2022\nFrom and after the date of the merger agreement, (1) no further offering period or purchase period will\ncommence pursuant to the ESPP\u037e and (2) no participant may increase his or her rate of payroll deductions\nunder the ESPP.\n\u2022\nAny offering period or purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be in progress as of the\neffective time of the merger will be terminated no later than one business day prior to the date on which the\neffective time of the merger occurs.\n\u2022\nNo later than one business day prior to the effective time of the merger, we will apply any funds within each\nESPP participant\u2019s account to the purchase of whole shares of our common stock in accordance with the\nterms of the ESPP. These shares will be deposited into the applicable participant\u2019s account and will treated\nin the same manner as any other outstanding share of common stock in connection with the consummation\nof the merger. Any amounts not used for the purchase of shares of our common stock will be refunded.\nQ:\nWhat am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?\nA:\nYou are being asked to vote on the following proposals:\n\u2022\nto adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Medallia and\nMedallia will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent\u037e\n\u2022\nto approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by\nMedallia to our named executive officers in connection with the merger\u037e and\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nto approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to\nsolicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the\nspecial meeting.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\nA:\nThe special meeting will take place on Thursday, October 14, 2021, at 8:00 a.m., Pacific time. You may attend the\nspecial meeting via a live interactive webcast on the internet at\nhttp://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MDLA2021SM.

This is an advisory vote and will\nnot be binding on Medallia or Parent. The underlying plans and arrangements providing for such compensation\nare contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAccordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the merger is consummated, the\ncompensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection with\nthe merger will or may be paid to Medallia\u2019s named executive officers even if our stockholders do not approve\nsuch compensation.\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust\nCompany, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d If you are a\nstockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf\nof Medallia. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares at the special\nmeeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of\nshares of our common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d If you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock\nheld in \u201cstreet name,\u201d this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee\nwho is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you\nhave the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their\ninstructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the\nstockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting unless you provide a \u201clegal proxy\u201d\nfrom your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to\nbe considered at the special meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You\nshould follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without\ninstruction, your shares will not be counted for the purpose of obtaining a quorum or voted on the proposals,\nwhich will have the same effect as if you voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no\neffect on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become\npayable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection with the merger or the adjournment proposal,\nexcept to the extent affecting the obtaining of a quorum at the meeting.\nQ:\nHow may I vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:\n\u2022\nby signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your\nconvenience)\u037e\n\u2022\nby visiting the internet address on your proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby calling the toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the\nenclosed proxy card.\nThe control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your\nshares of our common stock and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when\nvoting electronically over the internet or by telephone.

If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d to vote shares that you\nbeneficially own, you may still vote your shares of our common stock at the special meeting even if you have\npreviously voted by proxy. If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote will\nrevoke any previously submitted proxy.\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your\nbank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank,\nbroker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically\nover the internet or by telephone.

Furthermore, our\nexperience with virtual meetings demonstrated that the goals of accessibility and stockholder participation can\nbe well served by the virtual format.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a \u201cproxy,\u201d to vote your shares of our common\nstock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is\ncalled a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock is\ncalled a \u201cproxy card.\u201d You may follow the instructions on the proxy card to designate a proxy by telephone or by\nthe Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and returned a proxy card. Leslie Stretch and\nRoxanne Oulman, each with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy holders for the special\nmeeting.\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?\nA:\nYes.

You may also vote at the special meeting if you\nobtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the\nspecial meeting.\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will\nvote your shares in the way that you direct.\nIf you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a\nmatter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the Medallia\nBoard with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger\nagreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive\nofficers in connection with the merger\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or\ndates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger\nagreement at the time of the special meeting.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. After the merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal\ncontaining instructions for how to send your stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the\nappropriate cash payment for the shares of our common stock represented by your stock certificates.

Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you\nhold your shares of our common stock in book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of transmittal.

            "text": "Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger\nWe currently expect to complete the merger in 2021. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all,\ncannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many\nof which are outside of our control.\nAppraisal Rights\nIf the merger is consummated, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e\n(2) continuously hold their shares through the effective time of the merger\u037e (3) properly perfect appraisal of their\nshares\u037e (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements described in this proxy statement\u037e and (5) do not\nwithdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in\nconnection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to\nseek appraisal of their shares by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of\ntheir shares of our common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation\nof the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good\ncause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the\neffective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal\nReserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the\neffective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any\ntime before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to\neach stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and\n(2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make\nsuch voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process,\nstockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with\nrespect to the exercise of appraisal rights.\n28TABLE OF CONTENTS\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined\npursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration\nthat they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.\nOnly a stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of\nrecord must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Medallia before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt\nthe merger agreement\u037e (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e (3)\ncontinue to hold the subject shares of our common stock of record through the effective time of the merger\u037e and (4)\nstrictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly\nthe procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Medallia unless certain conditions are satisfied by the\nstockholders seeking appraisal. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are\ndescribed in further detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the\nDGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, a copy of which is attached as Annex B to this\nproxy statement. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish\nto exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate\nprocedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee.\nOther Matters",

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement.\nThis chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Medallia Board, the Strategic\nCommittee (as defined below), our representatives, and other parties. Other than as described below and for\ncontacts in the ordinary course of our business, there have been no material contacts between Medallia and Thoma\nBravo in the two years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Medallia Board regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward\nstrengthening our business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the Medallia Board has,\nfrom time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the\ncontinuation of, and potential improvements to, our current business plan, with Medallia remaining an independent\nentity\u037e (2) the investment in, and development of, new products and services\u037e (3) capital raising activities\u037e (4)\npotential expansion opportunities through acquisitions, partnerships or other commercial relationships\u037e and (5)\nbusiness combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of Medallia.\nSince completing its initial public offering in July 2019, Medallia\u2019s stock price has exhibited significant volatility. This\nvolatility was often associated with investor concerns related to (1) the nature of Medallia\u2019s operating results, which\nreflect quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in Medallia\u2019s bookings\u037e and (2) Medallia\u2019s ability to grow at a consistent rate.\nGiven our customer concentration in the hospitality sector, Medallia\u2019s business was also significantly impacted\nduring the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn April 7, 2021, a representative of a financial acquirer (which we refer to as \u201cFinancial A\u201d) contacted Leslie Stretch,\nour president and chief executive officer, regarding Financial A\u2019s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of\nMedallia. Financial A did not propose specific terms of an acquisition at this time. Mr. Stretch was familiar with\nFinancial A, but had not previously discussed an acquisition of Medallia with Financial A.\nOn April 11, 2021, a representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Stretch regarding Thoma Bravo\u2019s interest in\nexploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Thoma Bravo did not propose specific terms of an acquisition at this\ntime. Mr. Stretch was familiar with Thoma Bravo, but had not previously discussed an acquisition of Medallia with\nThoma Bravo.\nOn April 13, 2021, Mr. Stretch and the representative of Thoma Bravo spoke about Medallia generally and Thoma\nBravo\u2019s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Mr. Stretch informed this representative that he\nwould discuss Thoma Bravo\u2019s interest with the Medallia Board.\nAlso on April 13, 2021, Mr. Stretch and representatives of Financial A spoke about Medallia generally and Financial\nA\u2019s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Mr. Stretch informed these representatives that he would\ndiscuss Financial A\u2019s interest with the Medallia Board.\nFollowing these discussions with Thoma Bravo and Financial A, Mr. Stretch spoke with members of the Medallia\nBoard and informed them of the communications from, and discussions with, Thoma Bravo and Financial A. In\naddition, prior to the meeting of the Medallia Board on May 5, 2021, that is described below, Mr. Stretch regularly\nspoke with the members of the Medallia Board regarding these and subsequent communications.\nOn April 19, 2021, Mr. Stretch and the representative of Thoma Bravo spoke again about Thoma Bravo\u2019s interest in\nexploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Mr. Stretch again informed this representative that he would discuss\nThoma Bravo\u2019s interest with the Medallia Board.\nOn April 23, 2021, Mr. Stretch and Roxanne Oulman, our executive vice president and chief financial officer, spoke\nwith representatives of Morgan Stanley about the communications from Financial A and Thoma Bravo. During this\nconversation, the parties also discussed, in general terms, (1) the nature of the strategic alternatives that could be\navailable to Medallia should it elect to pursue a strategic review process\u037e (2) the broad outlines of a process that\nMedallia might engage in to evaluate its strategic alternatives\u037e (3) and the possibility\n32TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat Morgan Stanley could serve as our financial advisor in connection with a review of strategic alternatives.\nMorgan Stanley is well known to Medallia and Medallia management given Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications,\nextensive expertise, international reputation, knowledge of the industry in which Medallia operates and experience in\nadvising software companies in connection with potential strategic transactions.\nOn May 3, 2021, a representative of a financial acquirer (which we refer to as \u201cFinancial B\u201d) contacted Mr. Stretch\nregarding Financial B\u2019s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Mr. Stretch was familiar with Financial\nB, but had not previously discussed an acquisition of Medallia with Financial B.\nOn May 5, 2021, Mr. Stretch updated the Medallia Board about the communications from, and discussions with,\nThoma Bravo, Financial A and Financial B. Mr. Stretch expressed his view that it would be appropriate to better\nunderstand the nature of each firm\u2019s interest in an acquisition of Medallia. It was the consensus of the Medallia\nBoard to allow Mr. Stretch to share limited diligence information with Thoma Bravo, Financial A and Financial B.\nOn May 7, 2021, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman met with representatives of Thoma Bravo to discuss Medallia and its\nbusiness. During this meeting, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman provided their preliminary views on our financial and\noperating results for our fiscal first quarter.\nOn May 9, 2021, Mr. Stretch and certain members of the Medallia Board met informally with representatives of Wilson\nSonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, outside counsel to Medallia (which we refer to as \u201cWilson\nSonsini\u201d). Those present discussed the acquisition interest expressed by Financial A, Thoma Bravo and Financial B.\nOn May 11, 2021, Mr. Stretch and a representative of Financial B spoke about Medallia generally and Financial B\u2019s\ninterest in exploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Mr. Stretch informed this representative that he would\ndiscuss Financial B\u2019s interest with the Medallia Board.\nOn May 12, 2021, Ms. Oulman met with representatives of Thoma Bravo to discuss financial due diligence matters.\nOn May 17, 2021, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman met with representatives of Financial B to discuss Medallia and its\nbusiness. During this meeting, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman provided their preliminary views on our financial and\noperating results for our fiscal first quarter.\nAlso on May 17, 2021, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman met with representatives of Thoma Bravo to further discuss\nMedallia and its business.\nOn May 18, 2021, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman met with representatives of Financial A to discuss Medallia and its\nbusiness. During this meeting, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman provided their preliminary views on our financial and\noperating results for our fiscal first quarter.\nOn May 20, 2021, Mr. Stretch and a representative of Thoma Bravo spoke about Thoma Bravo\u2019s continued interest in\nacquiring Medallia. After this discussion, Thoma Bravo submitted a preliminary, nonbinding written indication of\ninterest to acquire Medallia in an all-cash transaction for $30.00 per share of our common stock.\nLater on May 20, 2021, the Medallia Board met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of\nMorgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the\nmembers of the Medallia Board their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the major\nstrategic alternatives available to Medallia, including (1) the continuation of our current business plan with Medallia\nremaining as an independent company\u037e and (2) a sale of Medallia. As part of this discussion, the representatives of\nMorgan Stanley provided Morgan Stanley\u2019s preliminary view as to the most likely potential strategic and financial\nacquirers of Medallia based on (1) Morgan Stanley\u2019s judgment and experience\u037e (2) the strategic fit of Medallia with\neach potential acquirer\u037e and (3) the ability and likelihood of each potential acquirer to engage in, and consummate, an\nacquisition of Medallia. After considering our near- and long-term prospects as an independent company, as well as\n(1) the terms of the preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest from Thoma Bravo and (2) the acquisition\ninterest expressed by Financial A and Financial B, the Medallia Board was of the view that a sale of Medallia in the\nnear term could be in the best interests of Medallia and our stockholders. As a result, the Medallia Board determined\nto commence a process to explore our strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of Medallia. To assist in the\nreview of strategic alternatives, the Medallia Board established a strategic committee (which we refer to as the\n\u201cStrategic Committee\u201d). The Strategic\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCommittee was formed in light of (1) the potentially significant workload that could be involved in evaluating\nstrategic alternatives\u037e (2) the possibility that Medallia management may need feedback and direction on relatively\nshort notice\u037e and (3) the benefits and convenience of having a subset of directors oversee and direct the process of\nconsidering strategic alternatives. The Medallia Board authorized and instructed the Strategic Committee, among\nother things, to (1) oversee and provide assistance to Medallia management and our advisers with respect to the\nexploration, evaluation, consideration, review and negotiation of the terms and conditions of any strategic\nalternative, including any sale of Medallia\u037e (2) take such other actions with respect to any strategic alternative as the\nStrategic Committee deemed necessary, appropriate or advisable\u037e and (3) recommend to the Medallia Board what\naction, if any, should be taken by Medallia with respect to any such transaction. The Medallia Board retained the\npower and authority to approve the final decision on pursuing a strategic alternative, including a sale of Medallia. It\nwas also understood that the Medallia Board would continue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic\nalternatives. The Medallia Board appointed Robert Bernshtyn, Mitchell K. Dauerman and Douglas M. Leone as the\nmembers of the Strategic Committee. The Medallia Board did not provide for the payment of any compensation to the\nmembers of the Strategic Committee in consideration of their service on the committee. Finally, the Medallia Board\nauthorized the retention of a financial adviser to assist us with a review of strategic alternatives, and delegated\nauthority to the Strategic Committee to select and retain this financial advisor.\nAlso on May 20, 2021, Mr. Stretch spoke with a representative of Financial B to discuss Medallia and its business.\nOn May 21, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of\nMorgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed potential\nstrategic and financial acquirers that, in Morgan Stanley\u2019s view, were the most likely to have an interest in an\nacquisition of Medallia based on (1) Morgan Stanley\u2019s judgment and experience\u037e (2) the strategic fit of Medallia with\neach potential acquirer\u037e and (3) the ability and likelihood of each potential acquirer to engage in, and consummate, an\nacquisition of Medallia. The Strategic Committee determined to undertake the exploration of strategic alternatives\nthrough a targeted, private process focused on the strategic and financial buyers identified by Morgan Stanley (and\nagreed to by the Strategic Committee) as the most likely to have an interest in acquiring Medallia. The Strategic\nCommittee believed that a targeted, private process had the greatest potential to minimize the risk of unwanted public\ndisclosure and speculation that Medallia was pursuing a sale. The Strategic Committee further believed that any\npublic disclosure and speculation concerning our future would be harmful to our business and competitive position,\nas well as to our relationships with our employees, customers and prospects. The Strategic Committee was informed\nthat Financial B wished to work cooperatively with another financial acquirer (which we refer to as \u201cFinancial C\u201d)\nand one of Financial B\u2019s portfolio companies (which we refer to as \u201cPortfolioCo\u201d) in connection with considering an\nacquisition of Medallia. We refer to these three potential acquirers collectively as the \u201cConsortium Group.\u201d Medallia\nand PortfolioCo have a go-to-market relationship. The Strategic Committee determined to allow this cooperation due\nto, among other things, the potential synergy value associated with a combination of Medallia and PortfolioCo and\nthe possibility that either or both of Financial B or Financial C would not pursue an acquisition on their own. The\nStrategic Committee also reviewed the terms of, and approved our entry into, an engagement letter with Morgan\nStanley. The Strategic Committee selected Morgan Stanley in view of Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, extensive\nexpertise, international reputation, knowledge of the industry in which Medallia operates and experience in similar\nsituations.\nAlso on May 21, 2021, Ms. Oulman and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Financial B to\ndiscuss financial due diligence matters.\nOn May 25, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of\nMorgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley further discussed the list\nof potential strategic and financial acquirers first presented at the meeting of the Strategic Committee on May 21,\n2021. After discussion, the Strategic Committee determined that a list of nine potential acquirers-four strategic\nacquirers and five financial acquirers (comprised of Thoma Bravo, Financial A, Financial B and Financial C (working\ntogether with PortfolioCo as part of the Consortium Group), and a fifth financial acquirer that we refer to as\n\u201cFinancial D\u201d)-were the most likely to have an interest in acquiring Medallia and the ability to pursue an acquisition\non an expedited basis. The Strategic Committee assigned responsibility to Morgan Stanley and certain members of\nthe Strategic Committee to contact each potential\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nacquirer regarding its interest in an acquisition of Medallia (which assignments were based on the strength of\nhistorical relationships with each potential acquirer). The representatives of Morgan Stanley also provided Morgan\nStanley\u2019s preliminary views on our stock price performance and compared it to other companies and the broader\nmarket. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that the strategic review process should be conducted\nquickly to minimize distraction for Medallia\u2019s management team. As such, the Strategic Committee instructed Morgan\nStanley to set proposed timelines with the potential acquirers, with the objective of receiving preliminary or revised\nacquisition proposals from all of those interested by June 15, 2021.\nAlso on May 25, 2021, we formally retained Morgan Stanley.\nAlso on May 25, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with representatives of Financial D concerning\nFinancial D\u2019s possible interest in exploring an acquisition of Medallia.\nAlso on May 25, 2021, Mr. Stretch held two different discussions with persons associated with Financial B. One of\nthese discussions was with a representative of Financial B concerning our decision to explore strategic alternatives.\nThe other discussion was with a representative of PortfolioCo\u037e this conversation concerned ways in which Medallia\nand PortfolioCo could combine their products and solutions.\nAlso on May 25, 2021, Financial A submitted a preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest to acquire\nMedallia in an all-cash transaction for $30.00 per share of our common stock.\nOn May 26, 2021, the Consortium Group submitted a preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest to acquire\nMedallia in an all-cash transaction for $33.00 per share of our common stock.\nAlso on May 26, 2021, a member of the Strategic Committee spoke separately with representatives of two different\npotential strategic acquirers (which we refer to as \u201cStrategic A\u201d and \u201cStrategic B,\u201d respectively) concerning their\npossible interest in exploring an acquisition of Medallia.\nAlso on May 26, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with a representative of a potential strategic acquirer\n(which we refer to as \u201cStrategic C\u201d) regarding Strategic C\u2019s interest in exploring an acquisition of Medallia.\nOn May 27, 2021, Mr. Stretch spoke with a representative of a potential strategic acquirer (which we refer to as\n\u201cStrategic D\u201d) concerning Strategic D\u2019s possible interest in exploring an acquisition of Medallia.\nAlso on May 27, 2021, Mr. Stretch and other members of Medallia management discussed our products with\nrepresentatives of PortfolioCo.\nOn May 28, 2021, Mr. Stretch, Ms. Oulman and other members of Medallia management met with representatives of\nPortfolioCo to discuss our sales and go-to-market strategies and initiatives.\nAlso on May 28, 2021, during a portion of a regularly scheduled meeting of the Medallia Board, representatives of\nMorgan Stanley provided the Medallia Board with an update on the strategic review process, including the identity\nof the potential acquirers approved by the Strategic Committee on May 25, 2021. Members of Medallia management\nreviewed with the Medallia Board a draft of the Projected Financial Information and described, among other things,\nthe process for preparing the Projected Financial Information, including the underlying assumptions and various\nexecution and other risks to realizing the Projected Financial Information. (The term Projected Financial Information is\ndefined in, and further information about the substance of the Projected Financial Information is contained in, the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Projected Financial Information.\u201d) The Medallia Board approved (1) the\nuse of the Projected Financial Information for purposes of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analysis of Medallia\u037e and (2)\nproviding the Projected Financial Information to potential acquirers at the discretion of the Strategic Committee.\nIn early June 2021, consistent with the instructions of the Strategic Committee, Morgan Stanley informed each\npotential acquirer that it should submit an initial or revised written indication of interest to acquire Medallia no later\nthan June 15, 2021.\nOn June 2, 2021, Mr. Stretch, Ms. Oulman, other members of Medallia management and representatives of Morgan\nStanley met with representative of Strategic A to discuss Medallia and its business.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 4, 2021, and June 5, 2021, we opened an online data room for the purpose of allowing interested parties to\nconduct due diligence on Medallia. Each of Thoma Bravo, Financial A, the Consortium Group and Strategic A\nrequested, and were granted, access to the data room.

In addition, both Financial A and the Consortium Group withdrew their indications of\ninterest and stated that they did not intend to further pursue an acquisition of Medallia.\nDuring the course of reviewing strategic alternatives, Medallia ultimately entered into confidentiality agreements with\nStrategic A, Thoma Bravo, Financial A, Financial B, Financial C, PortfolioCo and Financial D. None of these\nconfidentiality agreements included a \u201cstandstill\u201d or a restriction on making acquisition proposals.\nOn June 15, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted a revised preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest to acquire\nMedallia in an all-cash transaction for $35.00 per share of our common stock.\nOn June 16, 2021, and in response to the Bloomberg article, a senior representative of a financial acquirer (which we\nrefer to as \u201cFinancial E\u201d) contacted a representative of Morgan Stanley to inquire about any strategic review process\ninvolving Medallia that was being conducted.\nAlso on June 16, 2021, Financial D submitted a preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest to invest $700\nmillion in Medallia through a convertible preferred equity instrument, with the proceeds being used to repurchase a\nportion of our outstanding common stock.\nLater on June 16, 2021, the Medallia Board met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of\nMorgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance.

The representatives of\nMorgan Stanley reviewed and discussed with the Medallia Board Morgan Stanley\u2019s preliminary financial analysis of\nThoma Bravo\u2019s June 15 proposal, and a summary of the proposal from Financial D. They also compared the Projected\nFinancial Information to publicly available estimates prepared by equity research analysts reporting on Medallia. It\nwas the consensus of the Medallia Board that we should continue discussions with each of Thoma Bravo and\nFinancial D. The Medallia Board instructed Morgan Stanley to inform Thoma Bravo and Financial D that Medallia\nwould permit an additional two weeks of due diligence. In addition, the Medallia Board instructed Morgan Stanley to\nrequest that Thoma Bravo and Financial D improve\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe price and other terms of their proposals and submit revised proposals by July 1, 2021. Finally, Morgan Stanley\nwas instructed to inform Thoma Bravo that, although Thoma Bravo would be permitted to perform additional due\ndiligence, the Medallia Board expected Thoma Bravo to maintain a proposed acquisition price of no less than $35.00\nper share of our common stock.\nFollowing the meeting of the Medallia Board on June 16, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia\nmanagement and representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance.

The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the\nmembers of Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. The Strategic Committee discussed the proposals from Thoma\nBravo and Financial D.

The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the\nmembers of Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed and\ndiscussed Morgan Stanley\u2019s preliminary financial analysis of the proposal from Financial D. After discussing the\nproposal made by Financial D, the Strategic Committee determined that a minority investment of the type\ncontemplated by Financial D was not of interest. The Strategic Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to inform\nFinancial D of (1) this decision\u037e (2) the Strategic Committee\u2019s preference for a transaction involving the acquisition of\nall of Medallia at a price in cash in excess of $35.00 per share of our common stock\u037e and (3) the Strategic Committee\u2019s\ndesire that Financial D pursue an acquisition of all of Medallia (whether on its own or in partnership with another\nfinancial acquirer). The Strategic Committee further instructed Morgan Stanley to reinforce with Thoma Bravo that\nthe Medallia Board was interested in an acquisition at a price in cash of $35.00 per share of our common stock with\nhigh deal certainty. The Strategic Committee also reviewed the results of the strategic review process. As part of this\nreview, the Strategic Committee noted (1) the June 11, 2021, Bloomberg article speculating that Medallia was pursuing\na sale process\u037e (2) the absence, following that article, of any expressed interest in pursuing an acquisition of Medallia\nby anyone other than Financial E and Financial F\u037e and (3) the failure by Financial E and Financial F to affirmatively\nstate a specific interest in acquiring Medallia or to pursue any discussions regarding an acquisition. Given these\nconsiderations, the Strategic Committee discussed (1) the solicitation efforts engaged in by Morgan Stanley and (2)\nwhether additional affirmative contacts with other potential acquirers (including Financial E or Financial F) were\nwarranted. Notwithstanding the Strategic Committee\u2019s satisfaction with the solicitation efforts to date, the Strategic\nCommittee also discussed the possibility of negotiating for a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in any definitive merger agreement\ngoverning an acquisition of Medallia. Such a provision would permit Medallia, for a specified period, to affirmatively\nsolicit alternative transactions following entry into the definitive merger agreement. Members of Medallia\nmanagement also provided an update on preliminary results for Medallia\u2019s second fiscal quarter, and confirmed that\nthese results did not necessitate any updates to the Projected Financial Information. Mr. Stretch confirmed to the\nStrategic Committee that neither he nor any other member of Medallia management had engaged in any discussions\nwith Thoma Bravo or any other potential acquirer concerning any \u201crollover\u201d of\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nany equity stake in Medallia in connection with a potential acquisition, or any or potential terms of employment\nfollowing an acquisition. Following the meeting, at the direction of the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley informed\nThoma Bravo and Financial D of the Strategic Committee\u2019s respective determinations.\nOn July 15, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted a revised preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest to acquire\nMedallia in an all-cash transaction for $33.75 per share of our common stock.\nLater on July 15, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of\neach of Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance.

The Strategic Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to (1) reject\nThoma Bravo\u2019s latest acquisition proposal and request a \u201cbest and final\u201d proposal from Thoma Bravo (which\nproposal should provide (a) for a \u201cgo-shop\u201d process and (b) that Thoma Bravo would commit to fund, through\nequity investments, the entire purchase price, which would eliminate the need to obtain debt financing from third\nparties and the uncertainty related to that process)\u037e (2) inform Financial D that Medallia was only interested in\nreceiving a proposal for an acquisition of all of Medallia and that such proposal should be provided quickly\u037e and (3)\nspeak again with Financial F to (a) ascertain whether Financial F was open to considering an acquisition on an\nimmediate timetable\u037e and (b) gauge Financial F\u2019s possible interest in partnering with Thoma Bravo or Financial D,\ngiven that those firms had conducted a significant amount of due diligence.

The Medallia Board did not accept Thoma Bravo\u2019s proposal, but\ndid instruct Wilson Sonsini to proceed with negotiating an appropriate merger agreement, with the objective\n(assuming satisfactory resolution of outstanding points) of being able to announce an acquisition of Medallia by\nThoma Bravo no later than July 26, 2021. The Medallia Board also instructed Morgan Stanley to continue to\nencourage Financial D to submit a proposal to acquire all of Medallia.\nOn July 19, 2021, a representative of Morgan Stanley spoke with a representative of Financial F concerning Financial\nF\u2019s willingness to consider an acquisition of Medallia on an immediate timetable and possible interest in partnering\nwith another buyer. The representative of Financial F did not express a desire by Financial F to pursue an acquisition\nof Medallia.\nEarly on July 20, 2021, Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of Medallia, provided a draft merger agreement to legal counsel to\nThoma Bravo.\nFollowing delivery of the draft merger agreement, representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and legal counsel to\nThoma Bravo met regularly to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement and related disclosure\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nletter. The principal areas of negotiation in the merger agreement included (1) the terms of the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision\u037e\n(2) the termination fees payable by each of Medallia and Thoma Bravo and the circumstances in which those fees\nwould be payable\u037e (3) Thoma Bravo\u2019s request to be able to delay the closing of the merger until November 1, 2021, in\ncertain instances\u037e and (4) the treatment of equity awards held by all of Medallia\u2019s employees in the acquisition.\nWilson Sonsini and legal counsel to Thoma Bravo also negotiated the terms of the limited guaranty, the equity\ncommitment letter and the voting agreements.\nAlso on July 20, 2021, a representative of Morgan Stanley spoke with a representative of Financial A concerning\nFinancial A\u2019s interest in partnering with Financial D.

The representative of Financial B stated that, after speaking with\na representative of Financial D, a partnership with Financial D did not impact Financial B\u2019s view of Medallia\u2019s\nvaluation. As such, Financial B did not have any interest in further considering any participation in an acquisition of\nMedallia.\nOn July 21, 2021, Ms. Oulman and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Thoma Bravo on\ntwo occasions to discuss due diligence matters.\nOn July 22, 2021, Mr. Stretch, Ms. Oulman and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Thoma\nBravo to discuss due diligence matters.\nOn July 23, 2021, a representative of Financial F spoke with a representative of Morgan Stanley. During this\nconversation, the representative of Financial F stated that, following additional review, Financial F did not have an\ninterest in performing additional work to explore an acquisition of Medallia (either alone or in partnership with\nanother buyer).\nOn July 23, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of\nMorgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance.

The representatives\nof Wilson Sonsini discussed the terms of the draft merger agreement and the points that remained under negotiation.\nThe representatives of Morgan Stanley described the current status of discussions with Financial D, including that\n(1) Financial A, Financial B and Financial F had all declined to partner with Financial D on an acquisition of Medallia\nor pursue an acquisition on their own\u037e (2) Financial D continued to prefer a minority investment in Medallia\u037e and (3)\nFinancial D would need additional time to be in a position to decide whether it could pursue an acquisition of all of\nMedallia. The Strategic Committee determined to continue working with Thoma Bravo toward an acquisition.\nAlthough the Strategic Committee determined not to seek a further price increase from Thoma Bravo, it instructed\nWilson Sonsini to continue to negotiate the draft merger agreement, with a focus on providing a high level of closing\ncertainty for Medallia and appropriate flexibility for Medallia to solicit alternative transactions during the \u201cgo-shop\u201d\nperiod.\nOn July 24, 2021, Morgan Stanley provided the Medallia Board with customary disclosures regarding Morgan\nStanley\u2019s relationships with Thoma Bravo and its affiliates and Financial D and its affiliates.\nOn July 25, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of\nMorgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance.

The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the key terms of the merger agreement, the\nlimited guaranty, the equity commitment letter and the debt commitment letter. The Strategic Committee reviewed the\nrequest of Medallia management to retain two additional financial advisers-BofA Securities, Inc.

The Strategic Committee provided its recommendation that the Medallia\nBoard approve the entry into the merger agreement. Mr. Stretch confirmed to the Medallia Board that neither he nor\nany other member of Medallia management had engaged in any discussions with Thoma Bravo concerning any\n\u201crollover\u201d of any equity stake in Medallia in connection with a potential acquisition, or any potential terms of\nemployment following an acquisition. The Medallia Board noted the customary relationship disclosures provided by\nMorgan Stanley, BofA Securities and Wells Fargo Securities regarding each financial adviser\u2019s relationships with\nThoma Bravo and its affiliates\u037e the Medallia Board did not identify any concerns with these disclosures. The\nMedallia Board, after considering the factors more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-\nRecommendation of the Medallia Board and the Reasons for the Merger,\u201d (1) determined that the merger agreement,\nthe merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were fair to, advisable and in the best\ninterests of Medallia and its stockholders\u037e and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the\nother transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The representatives of Morgan Stanley described\nsolicitation activities that could be undertaken during the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period. The Medallia Board directed the\nStrategic Committee to oversee Medallia management, Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and Wells Fargo Securities as\nthey engaged in these activities following the entry into, and public disclosure of, the merger agreement.\nStill later on July 25, 2021, the merger agreement, limited guaranty, equity commitment letter, debt commitment letter\nand voting agreements were signed.\nEarly on July 26, 2021, before the opening of trading on the NYSE, we publicly disclosed our entry into the merger\nagreement.\nAlso on July 26, 2021, as directed by the Medallia Board, members of Medallia management and representatives of\neach of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and Wells Fargo Securities began contacting potential strategic and\nfinancial acquirers (including Strategic A, Strategic B, Strategic C, Strategic D, Financial A, Financial B, Financial C,\nFinancial D, Financial E and Financial F) about their interest in participating in the \u201cgo-shop\u201d process.\nOn July 30, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of\nWilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The members of Medallia management and the representatives of\nMorgan Stanley described their efforts in support of soliciting an alternative transaction to that contemplated by the\nmerger agreement.\nOn September 7, 2021, Medallia announced that the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period expired on September 4, 2021, without any\nalternative acquisition proposals having been received. During the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period, Morgan Stanley, BofA\nSecurities and Wells Fargo Securities, on behalf of Medallia, actively solicited 38 parties (composed of 19 strategic\nacquirers and 19 financial acquirers) regarding their interest in pursuing an acquisition of Medallia.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRecommendation of the Medallia Board and Reasons for the Merger",

            "text": "Recommendation of the Medallia Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Medallia Board\nThe Medallia Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Medallia and its\nstockholders\u037e and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement.\nThe Medallia Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2)\n\u201cFOR\u201d the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection\nwith the merger\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or\nappropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of\nthe special meeting.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Medallia Board consulted with Medallia management, as well\nas representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley. In recommending that Medallia stockholders vote\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement, the Medallia Board considered and analyzed a number of factors,\nincluding the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based on these\nconsultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the Medallia Board concluded that\nentering into the merger agreement with Parent was advisable and in the best interests of Medallia and our\nstockholders.\nThe Medallia Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination and\nrecommendation:\n\u2022\nFinancial Condition, Results of Operations and Prospects of Medallia\u037e Risks of Execution. The current,\nhistorical and projected financial condition, results of operations and business of Medallia, as well as\nMedallia\u2019s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company. In particular, the Medallia\nBoard considered Medallia\u2019s current business plan and long-term operating plan (as reflected in the\nProjected Financial Information). The Medallia Board considered these plans and the potential\nopportunities that they presented against, among other things: (1) the risks and uncertainties associated\nwith achieving and executing Medallia\u2019s current business plan and long-term operating plan in the short\nand long term\u037e (2) the impact of market, customer and competitive trends on Medallia\u037e and (3) the general\nrisks related to market conditions that could reduce the price of our common stock. Among the potential\nrisks identified by the Medallia Board were:\n\u25cb\nMedallia\u2019s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included among these\nrisks were consideration of (1) Medallia\u2019s size, as well as its financial resources, relative to those of its\ncompetitors\u037e (2) new and evolving competitive threats\u037e and (3) the substantial risks to achieving\nMedallia\u2019s long-term operating plan. The Medallia Board was also aware that adoption of Medallia\u2019s\nproduct offerings is subject to competing strategic and financial priorities among its existing and\npotential customers\u037e as a result, existing customers may determine to reduce or eliminate their use of\nMedallia\u2019s product offerings, and potential customers may determine not to adopt them at all, any of\nwhich could impact Medallia\u2019s operating results.\n\u25cb\nMedallia\u2019s historical customer churn rate and the impact that this has had, and could continue to have,\non Medallia\u2019s ability to achieve stable and consistent operating results.\n\u25cb\nThe historical quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in Medallia\u2019s bookings and the impact that these\nfluctuations have had, and could continue to have, on Medallia\u2019s stock price.\n\u25cb\nThe continued business and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the\npossibility that business conditions-for Medallia and the larger economy-will not improve and could\nget worse. In this regard, the Medallia Board was aware that some of Medallia\u2019s customers are\nassociated with the hospitality industry, which has been particularly impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic. Decreased demand for hospitality services-whether due to \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders or an\nunwillingness of people to travel-could have significant and prolonged effects on demand for\nMedallia\u2019s products by these customers.\n42TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u25cb\nThe challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly traded\ncompany, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarter-over-quarter performance. The Medallia\nBoard was aware that the price of our common stock could be negatively impacted if Medallia failed to\nmeet investor expectations, including if Medallia failed to meet its growth objectives.\n\u25cb\nThe historical execution of Medallia\u2019s business plan by Medallia management and their ability to\ncontinue to drive Medallia\u2019s business. In this regard, the Medallia Board was aware of instances in\nwhich Medallia failed to achieve certain expectations of Medallia\u2019s financial and operational\nperformance, and of the impact that these failures had on the price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nResults of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of an extensive strategic review process\noverseen by the Strategic Committee. The Medallia Board considered that, at Medallia\u2019s direction, Morgan\nStanley affirmatively contacted four potential strategic acquirers and five financial acquirers (including\nThoma Bravo) concerning their interest in an acquisition of Medallia. The Medallia Board considered the\nnature of the engagement by each of these potential acquirers over a multiple week period and that, of\nthese potential acquirers, only Thoma Bravo made a proposal for an acquisition of Medallia that was\ncapable of being accepted. The Medallia Board also was aware of the public speculation since early June\n2021 that Medallia was pursuing a sale and noted that, following such speculation, two additional financial\nacquirers (and no strategic acquirers) contacted Medallia about pursuing an acquisition. Neither of these\nfinancial acquirers engaged in substantive discussions regarding an acquisition or made a proposal that\nwas capable of being accepted.\n\u2022\nCertainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the merger consists entirely of\ncash, which provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business and financial execution\nrisks of Medallia\u2019s long-term operating plan. The receipt of cash consideration eliminates uncertainty and\nrisk for our stockholders related to the continued execution of Medallia\u2019s business. In that regard, the\nMedallia Board noted that Medallia\u2019s stock price could be negatively impacted if we failed to meet investor\nexpectations.\n\u2022\nBest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Medallia Board that the per share merger\nconsideration represents the best value reasonably obtainable for the shares of our common stock, taking\ninto account the Medallia Board\u2019s familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business strategy,\nassets, liabilities and general financial condition of Medallia on a historical and prospective basis. In\naddition, the Medallia Board believed that, measured against the longer-term execution risks described\nabove, the per share merger consideration reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of our common\nstock. The Medallia Board also considered that the per share merger consideration constitutes (1) a\npremium of approximately 20 percent to the closing price of our common stock on June 10, 2021, which was\nthe last full trading day before public speculation that Medallia was pursuing a sale\u037e and (2) a premium of\napproximately 29 percent to Medallia\u2019s unaffected 30-day price average.\n\u2022\nPermitted Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Proposals. The merger agreement permitted Medallia and\nits representatives, at the direction of the Medallia Board, from the date of the merger agreement until the\nno-shop period start date, to (1) initiate, solicit, propose, induce or encourage any alternative acquisition\nproposals from third parties\u037e (2) provide nonpublic information to third parties\u037e and (3) participate in\ndiscussions and negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.\n\u2022\nPotential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Medallia Board that none of the possible\nalternatives to the merger (including the possibility of continuing to operate Medallia as an independent\ncompany or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived risks of those alternatives,\nas well as the potential benefits and risks to Medallia\u2019s stockholders of those alternatives and the timing\nand likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for us\nto create greater value for our stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well as business,\ncompetitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory risks.\n\u2022\nFairness Opinion of Morgan Stanley. The oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Medallia Board,\nsubsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of July 25, 2021, and based upon and subject to the\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the\nscope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the per share\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprice to be received by our stockholders (other than the holders of the excluded shares) pursuant to the\nmerger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders. The opinion is more fully\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-",

With respect to the financial projections, Morgan\nStanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments of Medallia management of the future financial performance of Medallia. Morgan Stanley expressed\nno view as to the financial projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley\nassumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without\nany waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent will obtain\nfinancing in accordance with the terms set forth in the equity commitment letter and the debt commitment letter, and\nthat the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to\nMorgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental,\nregulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or\nrestrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be\nderived in the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial\nadvisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of Medallia and its legal, tax or\nregulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion does not address the\nrelative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or\nwhether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with\nrespect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Medallia\u2019s officers, directors or\nemployees, or any class of such persons, relative to the per share price to be received by the holders of shares of our\ncommon stock (other than the holders of the excluded shares) in the merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any\nindependent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Medallia, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any\nsuch valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and\nother conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, July 25, 2021. Events\noccurring after July 25, 2021 may affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and\nMorgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion\nand the preparation of its written opinion letter dated July 25, 2021 to the Medallia Board. The following summary is\nnot a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered\nby Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative\nimportance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables\nmust be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the\nfinancial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering\nany portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could\ncreate a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and relied\nupon (1) the management case and (2) the estimates set forth in an equity research analyst report, which was selected\nby Morgan Stanley, and reviewed, and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use, by Medallia management (which we refer\nto as the \u201cstreet case\u201d). Such equity research analyst was selected as a relatively close proxy for consensus\nestimates. The management case is more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-\nProjected Financial Information.\u201d In accordance with direction from the Medallia Board, Morgan Stanley utilized the\nstreet case and management case in its financial analyses described below. For purposes of its financial analyses\ndescribed below, Morgan Stanley treated Medallia\u2019s fiscal year projections, which end at the end of January for each\nfiscal year, as the prior calendar year projections. For example, fiscal year 2022 (ending January 2022) is treated as the\nequivalent of calendar year 2021 (ending December 2021).\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPublic Trading Comparables Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a\ncompany by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared\ncertain financial estimates for Medallia with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst research\nestimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, that share\nsimilar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things,\nsimilarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar\noperating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the \u201ccomparable companies\u201d). These companies were\nthe following:\nAdobe Inc.\nAnaplan, Inc.\nBlackline, Inc. \nCisco Systems, Inc.\nCoupa Software Inc.\nFive9, Inc.\nHubSpot Inc.\nQualtrics International Inc.\nRingCentral, Inc.\nSalesforce.com, Inc.\nServiceNow, Inc.\nSplunk Inc.\nMomentive Global Inc.\nTwilio Inc.\nWorkday, Inc.\nZendesk, Inc.\nZuora Inc.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue, which, for\npurposes of this analysis, (1) for Medallia, (a) was provided to Morgan Stanley, and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nuse, by Medallia management for calendar years 2021 and 2022 for the management case, and (b) was based on the\nestimates of a selected publicly available equity research analyst for calendar years 2021 and 2022 for the street case\nand approved for use by Morgan Stanley by the management of Medallia\u037e and (2) for each of the comparable\ncompanies, was based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for comparison purposes.\nFor purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined \u201caggregate value\u201d as a company\u2019s fully diluted equity value\nplus total debt, plus noncontrolling interest, plus preferred stock, less cash and cash equivalents.\nBased on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of aggregate value to\nestimated revenue multiples, and applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant revenue metric for\nMedallia. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized publicly available financial information, available as\nof July 23, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Medallia Board to approve and adopt the merger\nagreement).\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased on the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis and latest cash and debt balance as\nprovided by Medallia management, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of Medallia\ncommon stock as follows:\nPublic Trading Multiples\nSelected\nComparable\nCompany \nAV/Estimated \nRevenue\nMultiple \nRanges\nImplied Value\nper\nShare of \nMedallia\nCommon\nStock ($)\nCY 2021E AV / Revenue\nStreet Case\n8.0x - 15.0x\n23.48 - 42.09\nManagement Case\n8.0x - 15.0x\n23.79 - 42.70\nCY 2022E AV / Revenue\nStreet Case\n6.0x - 13.0x\n21.10 - 43.75\nManagement Case\n6.0x - 13.0x\n21.90 - 45.53\nNo company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to Medallia. In evaluating the comparable\ncompanies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,\nregulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Medallia\u2019s\ncontrol. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Medallia\u2019s business and the industry\ngenerally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects\nof Medallia and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the\naverage or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the\npotential future equity value of a company as a function of such company\u2019s estimated future revenue. The resulting\nequity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value. In connection with this\nanalysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per share of our common stock on a\nstandalone basis for each of the street case and management case.\nTo calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized calendar year 2023 revenue\nestimates under each of the street case and management case, respectively. For the street case, the 2023 revenue\nestimate was extrapolated and reviewed and approved for use by Morgan Stanley by Medallia management. Based\nupon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley applied a forward range of\naggregate value to estimated revenue multiples (based on the range of aggregate value to revenue multiples for the\ncomparable companies) to these revenue estimates, respectively, in order to reach a future-implied fully diluted\naggregate value.\nIn each case, Morgan Stanley then added estimated future net cash (with such estimates provided by Medallia\nmanagement for the management case and extrapolated for the street case (which extrapolations were reviewed and\napproved by Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by Medallia management)) to Medallia\u2019s future implied aggregate value to reach a\nfuture implied fully diluted equity value. In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided the future-implied fully diluted\nequity value by estimated fully diluted shares outstanding (with such estimates provided by Medallia management)\nto calculate a per-share price. Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied future share price by two years\nto July 31, 2021, at a discount rate of 9.1 percent, which rate was selected based on Medallia\u2019s estimated cost of\nequity, which was arrived at by applying the capital asset pricing model, to calculate the discounted fully diluted\nequity value.\nBased on Calendar Year 2023\nSelected AV /\nEstimated\nRevenue Multiple \nRanges\nImplied Value per\nShare\nof Medallia Common\nStock ($)\nEstimated Revenue\nStreet Case\n8.0x - 15.0x\n27.46 - 50.94\nManagement Case\n8.0x - 15.0x\n29.26 - 54.09\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a\ncompany by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company.\nMorgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for our common stock based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis to value Medallia as a stand-alone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the\nmanagement case for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as earnings (burdened by\nstock based compensation expense) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, less (1) taxes, and (2) capital\nexpenditures, including capitalized research and development, and plus or minus changes in net working capital. The\nmanagement case included extrapolations through calendar year 2030 prepared by Morgan Stanley with the guidance\nof Medallia management (which extrapolations were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by Medallia\nmanagement). The free cash flows and terminal values were discounted, using a midyear convention, to present\nvalues as of July 31, 2021, at a discount rate ranging from 7.7 percent to 9.6 percent, which discount rates were\nselected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of\nMedallia\u2019s weighted average cost of capital determined by the application of the capital asset pricing model. Morgan\nStanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 3.0 percent to 4.0 percent as part of its analyses, with such rates selected\nupon the application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. The resulting aggregate value was\nthen adjusted for net debt and further adjusted for the net present value of net operating losses.\nBased on the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by Medallia management,\nMorgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of our common stock as follows:\nImplied Value Per \nShare of Medallia\nCommon \nStock ($)\nManagement Case\n20.01 - 38.36\nPrecedent Transactions Multiples Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a\ncompany based on publicly available financial terms of selected comparable transactions. Morgan Stanley selected\nsuch comparable transactions because they shared certain characteristics with the merger, most notably because\nthey were similar software transactions. For such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the multiple of aggregate value\nof the transaction to the estimated next 12 months\u2019 (which we refer to as \u201cNTM\u201d) revenue based on publicly available\ninformation at the time of announcement of each such transaction.\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following is a list of the selected software transactions reviewed, together with the applicable multiple for each\nsuch transaction:\nSelected Software Transactions (Target/Acquiror)\nAV / NTM\nRevenue \nMultiple\nStrategic Acquirors\nAdaptive Insights Inc. / Workday, Inc.\n11.0x\nAppDynamics Inc. / Cisco Systems, Inc.\n13.7x\nAuth0, Inc. / Okta, Inc.\n~38.7x\nAVG Technologies N.V. / Avast Holding B.V.\n3.3x\nBroadsoft, Inc. / Cisco Systems, Inc.\n4.8x\nCallidus Software Inc. / SAP America, Inc.\n8.3x\nCarbon Black, Inc. / VMware, Inc.\n8.0x\nConcur Technologies, Inc. / SAP America, Inc.\n10.3x\nFive9, Inc. / Zoom Technologies Inc.\n25.7x\nFleetmatics Group Ltd. / Verizon Business International Holdings B.V.\n6.6x\nLifelock, Inc. / Symantec Corporation\n3.2x\nLivongo Health, Inc. / Teladoc Health, Inc.\n44.9x\nMulesoft, Inc. / Salesforce.com, Inc.\n15.7x\nNetsuite Inc. / Oracle Corporation\n9.1x\nQualtrics International Inc. / SAP America, Inc.\n16.5x\nSendGrid, Inc. / Twilio Inc.(1)\n15.7x\nSlack Technologies, Inc. / Salesforce.com, Inc.\n24.9x\nTableau Software Inc. / Salesforce.com, Inc.\n11.0x\nFinancial Sponsor Acquirors\nApptio Inc. / Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n7.0x\nBarracuda Networks Inc. / Thoma Bravo LP\n3.8x\nCambium Learning Group, Inc. / Veritas Capital Fund Management, L.L.C.\n4.2x\nCloudera, Inc. / Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC\u037e Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.

The following table\nsummarizes Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis:\nPrecedent Transaction Multiples\nRepresentative\nRanges of AV/ \nNTM Revenue \nMultiples\nImplied Value\nper \nShare of \nMedallia\nCommon \nStock ($)\nStreet Case\n6.0x - 15.0x\n18.56 - 44.34\nManagement Case\n6.0x - 15.0x\n18.88 - 45.15\nNo company or transaction utilized in the precedent-transactions analysis is identical to Medallia or the merger. In\nevaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of\nwhich are beyond Medallia\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Medallia\u2019s\nbusiness and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial\ncondition and prospects of Medallia and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the\npublic trading value of the companies and the aggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to\nwhich they are being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present value per share of Medallia\nderived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the per share price is not\nnecessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis of the consideration for the merger, but is one\nof many factors Morgan Stanley considered.\nOther Information\nMorgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analysis\nwith respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Medallia Board, including the following\ninformation described in the sections of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC-\nIllustrative Precedent Transaction Premiums,\u201d \u201c-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC-Historical Trading Ranges\u201d\nand \u201c-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC-Equity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets.\u201d\nIllustrative Precedent Transaction Premiums\nMorgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent transaction premiums analysis by reviewing software company\ntransactions larger than $1 billion in aggregate value since 2014. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the\ndistributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (1) the implied premium to the acquired company\u2019s\nclosing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the last trading day prior to the share price\nbeing affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news)\u037e and (2) the implied premium to the acquired\ncompany\u2019s 52-week high closing share price prior to announcement.\nBased on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment\nand experience, Morgan Stanley selected (1) a representative range of premia and applied such range to Medallia\u2019s\nclosing share price on June 10, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition\nrumors) and (2) a representative range of premia and applied such range to Medallia\u2019s 52-week high.\nThe following table summarizes such calculations:\nPremia\nRepresentative\nRanges\nImplied Value\nper \nShare of \nMedallia\nCommon \nStock ($)\nPremia to 1-Day Unaffected Share Price\n15% - 45%\n32.64 - 41.15\nPremia to 52-Week High Share Price\n(20)% - 15%\n38.00 - 54.63\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHistorical Trading Ranges\nMorgan Stanley noted certain trading ranges with respect to the historical share prices of our common stock. Morgan\nStanley reviewed a range of closing prices of our common stock for (1) various periods ending on July 23, 2021 (the\nlast full trading day prior to the meeting of the Medallia Board to approve and adopt the merger agreement) and (2) a\n30-trading day period ending on June 10, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the share price being affected by\nacquisition rumors). Morgan Stanley observed the following:\nTrading Periods\nRange of Trading Prices per\nShare \nof Medallia Common Stock ($)\nLast 30 Days ending on June 10, 2021\n23.86 - 29.99\nLast 30 Days ending on July 23, 2021\n30.57 - 34.16\nLast 90 Days ending on July 23, 2021\n23.86 - 34.16\nLast 365 Days ending on July 23, 2021\n23.86 - 47.50\nEquity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets\nMorgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for our common stock prepared and\npublished by equity research analysts prior to July 23, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the\nMedallia Board to approve and adopt the merger agreement). These targets reflected each analyst\u2019s estimate of the\nfuture public market trading price of our common stock. The 25th to 75th percentile range of undiscounted analyst\nprice targets for our common stock was $40.00 to $44.00 per share as of June 1, 2021 to July 15, 2021, with a median of\n$42.00 per share. Morgan Stanley discounted the range of analyst price targets per share for our common stock by\none year at a rate of 9.1 percent, which discount rate was selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its\nprofessional judgment and experience, to reflect Medallia\u2019s cost of equity. This analysis indicated an implied range of\nfully diluted equity values for our common stock of $36.67 to $40.34, with a median of $39.00 per share, as discounted\nby one year based on the 25th to 75th percentile undiscounted analyst price targets, as of July 23, 2021 (the last full\ntrading day prior to the meeting of the Medallia Board to approve and adopt the merger agreement).\nThe public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current\nmarket trading prices for our common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future\nfinancial performance of Medallia and future financial market conditions.\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the merger by the Medallia Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial\nand comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex\nprocess and not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion,\nMorgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to\nany analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without\nconsidering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and\nopinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other\nanalyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As\na result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s view of the actual value of Medallia.\nIn performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,\ngeneral business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond\nMedallia\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Medallia\u2019s business and the\nindustry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and\nprospects of Medallia and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan\nStanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or\nless favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial\npoint of view of the per share price to be received by our stockholders (other than the holders of the excluded shares)\npursuant to the merger agreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of July 25, 2021 to the\nMedallia Board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which shares of Medallia\ncommon stock might actually trade.\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe per share price to be received by our stockholders (other than the holders of the excluded shares) in the\naggregate pursuant to the merger agreement was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Medallia\nand Parent and was approved by the Medallia Board. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Medallia Board during\nthese negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to Medallia or the Medallia Board,\nnor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the\nmerger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other\nalternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are\navailable. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation\nas to how our stockholders should vote at the special meeting.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Medallia Board were one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the Medallia Board to recommend that the Medallia Board approve and adopt the merger agreement.\nConsequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Medallia\nBoard with respect to the consideration pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Medallia Board would\nhave been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of\nMorgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley\u2019s customary\npractice.\nThe Medallia Board retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, experience and expertise.\nMorgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual\nwealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage\nactivities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment\nbanking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any\ntime invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may\ntrade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt\nor equity securities or loans of Medallia, Parent, Thoma Bravo and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or\nany currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition,\nMorgan Stanley, its affiliates directors or officers, including individuals working with Medallia in connection with the\nmerger, may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by Thoma Bravo\nor its affiliates and their affiliated funds\u2019 respective portfolio companies (which we refer to collectively as the \u201cThoma\nBravo Related Entities\u201d).\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Medallia Board financial advisory services\nand an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex C, in connection with the\nmerger, and Medallia has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $45 million for its services, $5 million\nof which has been paid following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached to this proxy\nstatement as Annex C and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Medallia has\nalso agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional\nadvisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, Medallia has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley\nand its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any,\ncontrolling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or\nin connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nIn the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have not provided\nfinancial advisory or financing services to Medallia. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion,\nMorgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial advisory and financing services for the Thoma Bravo\nRelated Entities, and have received aggregate fees of approximately $20 to $35 million in connection with such\nservices. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Medallia, Parent and\nthe Thoma Bravo Related Entities and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the\nrendering of these services.\nProjected Financial Information",

            "text": "Projected Financial Information\nOther than in connection with its regular earnings press releases and related investor materials, we do not, as a matter\nof course, make public projections as to our future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the\nuncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Medallia\nmanagement regularly prepares projections as to our future financial performance for internal use.\n54TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn connection with our strategic planning process, Medallia management prepared and provided to the Medallia\nBoard various unaudited forward-looking financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2025. This forward-\nlooking information is collectively referred to as the \u201cProjected Financial Information.\u201d The Projected Financial\nInformation was used by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion to the Medallia Board and related financial\nanalyses (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of Morgan Stanley &\nCo. LLC\u201d). A summary of the Projected Financial Information is set forth below.\nThe Projected Financial Information was used, at the direction of the Medallia Board, to extrapolate cash flows for\nfiscal years 2022 through 2025 for purposes of Morgan Stanley\u2019s discounted free cash flow analysis (as described in\nmore detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\u201d). Such\nextrapolations were reviewed by Medallia management and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by the Medallia\nBoard and Medallia management. At Medallia\u2019s direction, Morgan Stanley relied on the accuracy and completeness\nof the Projected Financial Information utilized in its financial analyses and advice to the Medallia Board, as well as the\nassurances of Medallia management that (1) it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such\ninformation inaccurate or misleading\u037e and (2) the Projected Financial Information were reasonably prepared based on\nthe best currently available estimates and judgments of Medallia management of the future financial performance of\nMedallia.\nThe Projected Financial Information was developed by Medallia management without giving effect to the merger or to\nany changes to Medallia\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the merger. The\nProjected Financial Information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the merger to be completed\u037e it\nshould not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe Projected Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d). In addition, the\nProjected Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by\nthe SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information.\nNeither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have (1) compiled,\nreviewed, audited, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Projected Financial Information\u037e (2)\nexpressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or the achievability of the Projected\nFinancial Information\u037e or (3) assumed any responsibility for the Projected Financial Information. Our independent\nregistered public accounting firm disclaims any association with the Projected Financial Information.\nThe Projected Financial Information was prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Medallia management. In the\nopinion of Medallia management, the Projected Financial Information (1) was prepared on a reasonable basis\u037e (2)\nreflected the best estimates and judgments then available (taking into account the relevant information available to\nMedallia management at that time)\u037e and (3) presented, to Medallia management\u2019s knowledge, our expected future\nfinancial performance within the parameters and under the assumptions specified in preparing the Projected Financial\nInformation. Because the Projected Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to\nsensitivities and assumptions, as well as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business\ndevelopments. The Projected Financial Information also covers multiple years, and such information by its nature\nbecomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Projected Financial Information is not, and should not be\nconsidered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Projected Financial Information is not fact and\nshould not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of Medallia\u2019s future results.\nAlthough the Projected Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous\nassumptions and estimates as to future events made by Medallia management. The Projected Financial Information\nwill be affected by our ability to achieve our strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The\nProjected Financial Information reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.\nImportant factors that may affect actual results and cause the Projected Financial Information not to be achieved\ninclude, among others, (1) general economic conditions (including the impact of COVID-19)\u037e (2) the accuracy of\ncertain accounting assumptions\u037e (3) changes in actual or projected cash flows\u037e (4) competitive pressures\u037e and (5)\nchanges in tax laws. Additional factors that may impact us or our business can be found in the various risk factors\nincluded in our periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside\nof our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Projected Financial Information will be realized, and\nactual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Projected Financial Information. The\nProjected Financial Information may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and does not consider any\nevents or circumstances after the date that it was prepared, including the announcement of the entry into the merger\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nagreement. You should evaluate the Projected Financial Information, if at all, in conjunction with our historical\nfinancial statements and other information regarding Medallia contained in our public filings with the SEC. Except to\nthe extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projected\nFinancial Information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such information was prepared or to reflect\nthe occurrence of future events, even if any or all of the assumptions underlying the Projected Financial Information\nare shown to be in error or no longer appropriate.\nCertain of the financial measures included in the Projected Financial Information are \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures.\u201d\nThese are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-\nGAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial\nmeasures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation.\nAccordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to,\nfinancial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a\nbusiness combination transaction, such as the Projected Financial Information, are excluded from the definition of\n\u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Projected Financial\nInformation is not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would\notherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of\nnon-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Medallia Board or Morgan Stanley.\nAccordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Projected Financial Information is provided in\nthis proxy statement.\nThe Projected Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. By including the Projected Financial\nInformation in this proxy statement, neither we nor any of our representatives has made or makes any representation\nto any person regarding our ultimate performance as compared to the information contained in the Projected Financial\nInformation. The inclusion of the Projected Financial Information should not be regarded as an indication that the\nMedallia Board, Medallia or any other recipient of the Projected Financial Information considered, or now considers,\nthe Projected Financial Information to be predictive of actual future results. Further, the inclusion of the Projected\nFinancial Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Medallia that the\ninformation presented is material. The Projected Financial Information is included in this proxy statement solely to\ngive our stockholders access to the information that was made available to the Medallia Board and Morgan Stanley.\nThe Projected Financial Information is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any Medallia\nstockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal\nrights with respect to their shares.\nExcept as noted below, the Projected Financial Information was provided to Thoma Bravo and its affiliates (including\nParent and Merger Sub).\nThe following table summarizes the Projected Financial Information.\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n(dollars in millions)(1)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\nRevenue\n$578\n$708\n$876\n$1,074\nCost of Goods Sold\n(186)\n(214)\n(250)\n(292)\nGross Profit\n392\n494\n626\n782\nNon-GAAP Operating Expenses(2)\n(412)\n(444)\n(507)\n(560)\nNon-GAAP EBIT(3)\n(20)\n50\n119\n222\nAdditional Cash Adjustments(4)(5)\n(18)\n(7)\n(4)\n(5)\nDepreciation\n24\n31\n34\n37\nStock-based Compensation Expense\n(125)\n(141)\n(162)\n(187)\nEBITDA(5)(6)\n(139)\n(68)\n(14)\n66\nTaxes(5)\n-\n-\n-\n(9)\nChange in Net Working Capital\n(8)\n(19)\n(8)\n(36)\nCapital Expenditures\n(34)\n(37)\n(52)\n(54)\nUnlevered free cash flow(5)(7)\n(180)\n(124)\n(74)\n(32)\n(1)\nTotals may not foot due to rounding.\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(2)\nNon-GAAP operating expenses include non-GAAP sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative\nexpenses.\n(3)\nNon-GAAP EBIT is defined as Medallia\u2019s GAAP loss from operations plus stock-based compensation, employer payroll tax\nexpense related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, option\nacceleration payments, and restructuring and other expenses.\n(4)\nAdditional cash adjustments include cash expenses for acquisitions and corporate development, employee RSU taxes and option\npayment expenses.\n(5)\nNot provided to Parent.\n(6)\nEBITDA is defined as Medallia\u2019s non-GAAP EBIT less cash expenses for acquisitions and corporate development, employee RSU\ntaxes and option payment expenses, plus depreciation, and less stock based compensation expenses.\n(7)\nUnlevered free cash flow is defined as Medallia\u2019s EBITDA less taxes (at estimated marginal tax rate) less capital expenditures\nincluding capitalized R&D, plus or minus changes in net working capital and other adjustments.",

However, with respect to any\nMedallia PSUs that remain outstanding and subject to performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the\neffective time, the performance metrics of such Medallia PSUs will be deemed achieved at a specified level of\nachievement that reflects the actual level of achievement as of the effective time, and the corresponding cash amount\nshall be paid out in lump sum at the end of a period that corresponds to the applicable award\u2019s performance period,\nsubject to the holder\u2019s continued service through such date.\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, performance metrics with respect to Medallia PSUs will be deemed\nachieved at the following levels:\n\u2022\nMedallia PSUs granted on April 15, 2019, will be deemed achieved at 50 percent of target levels\u037e\n\u2022\nMedallia PSUs granted on June 19, 2019, will be deemed achieved at 100 percent of target levels\u037e\n\u2022\nMedallia PSUs granted on March 15, 2020, will be deemed achieved at 100 percent of target levels\u037e\n\u2022\nMedallia PSUs granted on April 15, 2021, will be deemed achieved at 117 percent of target levels\u037e\n\u2022\nMedallia PSUs granted on May 15, 2021, will be deemed achieved at 107 percent of target levels\u037e and\n\u2022\nMedallia PSUs granted on June 15, 2021, will be deemed achieved at 107 percent of target levels.\nTreatment of Medallia Options\nAs of August 20, 2021, there were outstanding Medallia options to purchase an aggregate of 20,949,726 shares of our\ncommon stock with an exercise price below the per share price, of which Medallia options to purchase an aggregate\nof 3,150,000 shares of our common stock were held by our current non-employee directors and of which Medallia\noptions to purchase an aggregate of 11,547,692 shares of our common stock were held by our current executive\nofficers.\nAt the effective time of the merger, each vested Medallia option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior\nto the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in\ncash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price per\nshare of such Medallia option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon exercise in full\nof such Medallia option.\nAt the effective time of the merger, each unvested Medallia option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately\nprior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an\namount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise\nprice per share of such Medallia option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon\nexercise in full of such Medallia option, which cash amount will, subject to the holder\u2019s continued service with Parent\nand its representatives through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the unvested\nMedallia option for which such cash amount was exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms.\nAny Medallia options for which the exercise price per share of such Medallia options is equal to or greater than the\nper share price will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect of such Medallia option. As of\nAugust 20, 2021, there were no outstanding Medallia options with an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the\nper share price.\nTreatment of the ESPP\nFrom and after the date of the merger agreement, no further offering period or purchase period will commence\npursuant to the ESPP and no participant may increase his or her rate of payroll deductions under the ESPP. Any\noffering period or purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be in progress as of the effective time of the\nmerger will be terminated no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger\noccurs. We will make any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or\npurchase period, but otherwise will treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and\ncompleted offering period or purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP. Each outstanding purchase right under\nthe ESPP will be exercised as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the\nmerger occurs. On such exercise date, we will apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP within each\nparticipant\u2019s account to the purchase of whole shares\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof our common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP and, promptly thereafter, will refund any remaining\namounts credited to each such account to the applicable participant.

For additional details regarding\nthe terms of the payments quantified below, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Interests of\nMedallia\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity-Based Awards\u201d and \u201c-Interests of\nMedallia\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Policy.\u201d\nThe amounts in the table are estimated using the following assumptions and such additional assumptions as may be\nset forth in the footnotes to the table:\n\u2022\nthat the effective time of the merger will occur on October 25, 2021 (which is the assumed closing date of\nthe merger solely for purposes of this proxy statement, including this golden parachute compensation\ndisclosure)\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the named executive officer will have a qualifying termination of his or her employment at the effective\ntime of the merger that results in severance benefits becoming payable to him under the Severance Policy\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the equity awards that are outstanding as of October 25, 2021, are the equity awards that Medallia has\ngranted to the named executive officer through August 20, 2021\u037e and\n\u2022\nthat the number of shares of our common stock subject to Medallia PSUs will be determined at the levels of\nachievement provided for in the merger agreement.\nThe amounts reported below are estimates based on these and other assumptions that may or may not actually occur\nor be accurate on the relevant date. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in\nconnection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth below. Medallia\u2019s named executive officers will not\nreceive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation or tax reimbursements in connection with the merger. As\nrequired by applicable SEC rules, all amounts below that are determined using the per share value of our common\nstock have been calculated based on the per share price.\nName\nCash \n($)(1)\nEquity \n($)(2)\nPerquisites/\nBenefits \n($)(3)\nTotal \n($)(4)\nLeslie J.

The following table sets forth the value of\neach of the base salary and target incentive opportunity severance benefits payable to a named executive officer under the terms\nof the Severance Policy.\n(2)\nThis amount includes the \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d vesting acceleration of 100 percent of the unvested portion of the named executive\nofficer\u2019s outstanding Medallia RSUs, Medallia PSUs (to the extent that the applicable performance metrics are deemed achieved\npursuant to the\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmerger agreement), and Medallia options to which the named executive officer may become entitled pursuant to the treatment\nof such awards under the Severance Policy in connection with a qualifying termination during the change in control period, as\ndescribed in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Interests of Medallia\u2019s Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger-Severance Policy.\u201d\nWith respect to Medallia RSUs, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the per share price, multiplied by (ii) the total\nnumber of shares of our common stock subject to the Medallia RSUs held by the named executive officer. Accordingly, the\namount represents unvested Medallia RSUs covering a total of 605,275 shares of our common stock for Mr. Stretch\u037e 251,111\nshares of our common stock for Ms. Oulman\u037e 196,751 shares of our common stock for Ms. Carducci\u037e 116,933 shares of our\ncommon stock for Mr. Ottosson, and 160,980 shares of our common stock for Mr. Duan.\nWith respect to Medallia PSUs, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the per share price, multiplied by (ii) the total\nnumber of shares of our common stock subject to the Medallia PSUs held by the named executive officer that are deemed to have\nsatisfied the applicable performance condition pursuant to the merger agreement. Accordingly, the amount represents unvested\nMedallia PSUs covering a total of 0 shares of our common stock for Mr. Stretch\u037e 244,588 shares of our common stock for Ms.\nOulman\u037e 52,223 shares of our common stock for Ms. Carducci\u037e 60,298 shares of our common stock for Mr. Ottosson, and\n131,906 shares of our common stock for Mr. Duan.\nWith respect to each Medallia option, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the sum of the per share price less the\napplicable option\u2019s per share exercise price, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of our common stock subject to the\nMedallia option held by the named executive officer. Accordingly, the amount represents unvested Medallia options covering a\ntotal of 2,824,822 shares of our common stock for Mr. Stretch\u037e 270,841 shares of our common stock for Ms. Oulman\u037e 19,377\nshares of our common stock for Ms. Carducci\u037e 22,921 shares of our common stock for Mr. Ottosson, and 0 shares of our\ncommon stock for Mr. Duan.\n(3)\nThis amount represents a lump sum cash payment equal to 12 months of premiums (18 months with respect to Mr. Stretch) that\nthe named executive officer otherwise would be required to pay for continued post-employment, group health coverage. These\namounts are a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d severance benefit that each of Messrs. Stretch, Ottosson and Duan and Ms. Oulman and Ms.\nCarducci may become entitled to receive under the Severance Policy in connection with a qualifying termination during the\nchange in control period, as described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Interests of Medallia\u2019s\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Policy.\u201d\n(4)\nUnder the Severance Policy, amounts are subject to reduction in the event the named executive officer would receive a greater\nbenefit on an after-tax basis by having some of his or her change in control-related payments and benefits being cut back rather\nthan paying the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on such amounts. This amount assumes no such\nreduction is applied.\nEmployment Arrangements Following the Merger\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, none of Medallia\u2019s executive officers have (1) reached an understanding on\npotential employment or other retention terms with the surviving corporation or with Parent or Merger Sub\u037e or (2)\nentered into any definitive agreements or arrangements regarding employment or other retention with the surviving\ncorporation or with Parent or Merger Sub to be effective following the consummation of the merger. However, prior to\nthe effective time of the merger, Parent or Merger Sub may initiate discussions regarding employment or other\nretention terms and may enter into definitive agreements regarding employment or retention for certain of Medallia\u2019s\nemployees to be effective as of the effective time of the merger.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger",

The following summary does not constitute any legal or other\nadvice and does not constitute a recommendation that our stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section\n262. Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in\nthat holder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of our common stock held of record in the name of\nanother person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an\nappraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other\nnominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee\nto ensure that appraisal rights are exercised. Stockholders should carefully review the full text of Section 262 as\nwell as the information discussed below.\nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock who (1) submit a\nwritten demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares to Medallia prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger\nagreement\u037e (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (3) continuously are the record holders\nof such shares through the effective time of the merger\u037e and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures and satisfy\ncertain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of our common stock\nappraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of our\ncommon stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,\ntogether with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown)\ninterest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the\nmerger through the date of payment of the judgment. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal\nproceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of our\ncommon stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued or perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding\nshares of our common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (2) the value of the\nmerger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the \u201cownership\nthresholds.\u201d Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the\ndate the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the\nproceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal,\ninterest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair\nvalue of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless\npaid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to\nsuch entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record\ndate for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This\nproxy statement constitutes Medallia\u2019s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection\nwith the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B. In connection with the\nmerger, any holder of shares of our common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve\nsuch holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex B carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of\nSection 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder\nwho loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger\nagreement without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures\nfor exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of our common stock, Medallia believes that if a stockholder is\nconsidering exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common stock must do ALL of\nthe following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Medallia a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger\nagreement at the special meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the\neffective time of the merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares\nbefore the effective time of the merger)\u037e and\n\u2022\na stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in a\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the surviving corporation must file a petition in\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such\nstockholders within 120 days after the effective time of the merger (the surviving corporation is under no\nobligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so).\nIn addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine\nstockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted\nappraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe merger agreement, each of our stockholders who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must\nvote against the adoption of the merger agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Medallia, before the vote on the adoption of the\nmerger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. In addition,\nthat stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of\nthe adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by mail or via the\nInternet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will\nnullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of\nrecord the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record\nthrough the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will,\nunless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the\nstockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a\nstockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing\ninstructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the\nmerger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing\nto vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal\nsatisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from\nany proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger\nagreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the\nvote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered\nin that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be executed by or on\nbehalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Medallia of the identity of the holder and that the\nstockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. If the shares are owned of record\nin a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed\nby or on behalf of the record owner, and if such shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint\ntenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized\nagent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a\nholder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in\nexecuting the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN \u201cSTREET NAME\u201d BY A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER\nNOMINEE AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK,\nBROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES\nFOR THE BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE\nSHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF\nANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO\nCAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY\nTO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nMedallia, Inc.\n575 Market Street, Suite 1850\nSan Francisco, California 94105\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock may\nwithdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement,\nwithout interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, by delivering to Medallia, as the surviving corporation, a\nwritten withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than\n60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to\nany stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned\nupon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect the right\nof any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to\nwithdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the\neffective time of the merger. If Medallia, as the surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a\ndemand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such\nstockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of\nChancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder\nwill be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could\nbe less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify\neach record holder of shares of our common stock who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to\nSection 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, that the merger has become\neffective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of\nshares of our common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262\n(or the beneficial owner of such shares) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder,\ndemanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal.\nThe surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders\nshould not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the\nfair value of the shares of our common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of our common stock who desire to\nhave their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their\nshares of our common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a\npetition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who has complied\nwith the requirements for an appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled,\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nupon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of\nshares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which Medallia has received\ndemands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation must send\nthis statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written\nrequest for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal,\nwhichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on\nbehalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving\ncorporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a\nstockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of our common stock and a copy thereof is served\nupon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to\nfile with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders\nwho have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not\nbeen reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of\nsuch petition be given to the surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the verified list at the\naddresses stated therein. Any such notice shall also be given by one or more publications at least one week before\nthe day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or any\nother publication which the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The costs of any such notice are borne by\nthe surviving corporation.\nAfter notice to dissenting stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court\nof Chancery will determine the stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to\nappraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal\nfor their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of\nthe appraisal proceedings. If any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may\ndismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who assert appraisal\nrights unless (1) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one\npercent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section\n262 or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of the shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued\nand perfected exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of our common stock entitled to appraisal, and that at\nleast one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal\nrights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of\nChancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of\nvalue arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the\namount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into\naccount all relevant factors. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good\ncause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be\ncompounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of\npayment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the Delaware Court of\nChancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking\nappraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262,\ninterest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving\ncorporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery\u037e and (2) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v.\nUOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in\nan appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making this\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndetermination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the\nnature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light\non future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element\nof value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the\nDelaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known\nelements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future\nvalue, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and\nnot the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive\npursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm\nas to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and\nmay not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Medallia believes that the per share price is\nfair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value\nhigher or lower than, or the same as, the per share price. Neither Medallia nor Parent anticipates offering more than\nthe per share price to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Medallia and Parent reserves the rights\nto make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of our common stock is less than the per\nshare price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been\nsatisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of\nthe appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems\nequitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also\norder that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,\nincluding, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata\nagainst the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each\nparty bears its own expenses.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262 fails to\nperfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of our common stock\nwill be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the per share price\nas provided in the merger agreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such holder\u2019s right to\nappraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the\nownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the\nstockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an\nacceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with\nSection 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of\ndividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of\nrecord at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an\nappraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been\nsatisfied in respect of the stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if such stockholder delivers to the surviving\ncorporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger,\neither within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the surviving\ncorporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no\nappraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval\nof the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just\u037e provided, however,\nthat the foregoing shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nterms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares\nin accordance with the merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently,\nany stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to\nexercise those rights.\nAccounting Treatment",

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be\nrelevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of our common stock whose shares\nare converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d) Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court\ndecisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other applicable\nauthorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing\ninterpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of our\ncommon stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for\ninvestment purposes).\nThis discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant\nto holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:\n\u2022\ntax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S.\nfederal income tax laws, such as financial institutions\u037e tax-exempt organizations\u037e S corporations,\npartnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes\u037e insurance companies\u037e mutual funds\u037e dealers in stocks and securities\u037e traders\nin securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities\u037e regulated\ninvestment companies\u037e real estate investment trusts\u037e entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules\u037e\nholders who hold their common stock as \u201cqualified small business stock\u201d for purposes of Sections 1045\nand 1202 of the Code\u037e Non-U.S. Holders that own (directly or by attribution) more than five percent of our\ncommon stock\u037e or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion,\nstraddle or other risk reduction transaction\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory transaction\nor pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to U.S. Holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other\nentity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income\nwith respect to the shares of our common stock being taken into account in an \u201capplicable financial\nstatement\u201d (as defined in the Code)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any\u037e\n\u2022\nany state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences\u037e or\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of\ntheir shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.\n69TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such\npartnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.\nPartnerships holding shares of our common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding\nthe consequences of the merger.\nNo ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger\ndescribed below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would\nultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE\nLEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX\nLAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of\none or more United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) has a valid election\nin effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to\nthe difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares\nsurrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.\nHolder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if\nsuch U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A\nreduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder\n(including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different\nblocks of shares of our common stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted\ntax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock\nthat is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax\nunless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States\n(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained\nby such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation,\nsuch gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an\napplicable income tax treaty)\u037e\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case\nsuch gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an\napplicable income tax treaty)\u037e or\n\u2022\nMedallia is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is defined in\nSection 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as \u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the shorter of the five-year\nperiod preceding the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable\nshares of our common stock (which we refer to as the \u201crelevant period\u201d) and, if shares of our common\nstock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of\nthe Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of our\ncommon stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except\nthat the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its\nU.S. real property interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair\nmarket value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or\nbusiness. For this purpose, U.S. real property interests generally include land, improvements and\nassociated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are\nnot, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S.\nHolders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if\nwe are a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds received by\na holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS\nForm W-9 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-\nU.S. Holder\u2019s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (b)\notherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nA U.S. holder may be required to retain records related to such holder\u2019s common stock and file with its U.S. federal\nincome tax return, for the taxable year that includes the Merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the\nmerger.\nWithholding on Foreign Entities\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder\n(which we refer to as \u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a\n\u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under these rules) unless such institution enters into an\nagreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax\nauthorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain\nequity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S.\nowners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on\ncertain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a\ncertification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An\nintergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these\nrequirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.\nThe Treasury Department recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would\neliminate the federal withholding tax of 30 percent applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of\nour common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers\nmay generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nHolders of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible\nimplications of FATCA on the disposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.\n71\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

The\nparties filed a notification and report form with the FTC and DOJ on August 6, 2021. A transaction notifiable under\nthe HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filing\nof their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. The waiting period\nunder the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on September 7, 2021.\nUnder the Austrian Cartel Act, the merger cannot be completed until the merger is notified to the Federal Competition\nAuthority (Bundeswettbewerbsbeh\u00f6rde, which we refer to as the \u201cFCA\u201d) and the Federal Cartel Prosecutor\n(Bundeskartellanwalt, which we refer to as the \u201cFCP\u201d) and the applicable waiting period has expired or been\nterminated. The parties made the necessary notification on August 9, 2021. If neither the FCA nor the FCP apply to\nthe Cartel Court (Kartellgericht) for an in-depth investigation within the waiting period, the merger is deemed legally\ncleared. The parties will receive a declaration confirming whether or not an in-depth investigation has been opened\none or two business days after expiration of the waiting period. The waiting period under the Austrian Cartel Act\nexpired at 11:59 p.m., Central European time, on September 6, 2021.\nMedallia and Parent have each agreed to (1) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause the other\nto be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or\nthe governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is made\u037e and (2) use its\nrespective reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to, as soon as practicable, (a) cause the expiration or\ntermination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws applicable to the\nmerger and (b) obtain any required consents pursuant to any antitrust laws applicable to the merger.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable,\nincluding seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or\nrequiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At\nany time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, any state could take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action\ncould include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Medallia\nor Parent. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nSubject to the terms of the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to, if and to the extent necessary\nto obtain clearance of the merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws applicable to the merger, (1)\noffer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (a) the sale, divestiture,\nlicense or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether\ntangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective affiliates, if\napplicable), on the one hand, and Medallia and its subsidiaries, on the other hand\u037e and (b) any other restrictions on\nthe activities of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and Medallia\nand its subsidiaries, on the other hand\u037e and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal proceedings, whether judicial or\nadministrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger.\n72TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nOne or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it\ngrants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory\nprocess or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even\npreclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain\nall of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a\nsubstantial period of time between the approval by our stockholders and the completion of the merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that\nthese regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these\nregulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the\nmerger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement.

The allegations include that the preliminary proxy statement omitted material information regarding Medallia\u2019s\nfinancial projections and the analyses performed by Morgan Stanley.

The merger agreement is\ndescribed below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and\nconditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Medallia, Parent, Merger Sub or\ntheir respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the\nmerger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this\ndocument and in our filings with the SEC regarding Medallia and our business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than the second\nbusiness day after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions\nthat by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of\nsuch conditions\u037e or (2) at such other time agreed to by Medallia, Parent and Merger Sub.

Any\noffering period or purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be in progress as of the effective time of the\nmerger will be terminated no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger\noccurs. We will make any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or\npurchase period, but otherwise will treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and\ncompleted offering period or purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP. Each outstanding purchase right under\nthe ESPP will be exercised as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the\nmerger occurs. On such exercise date, we will apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP within each\nparticipant\u2019s account to the purchase of whole shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP\nand, promptly thereafter, will refund any remaining amounts credited to each such account to the applicable\nparticipant. These shares will be deposited into the applicable participant\u2019s account and will treated in the same\nmanner as any other outstanding share of common stock in connection with the consummation of the merger.\nPayment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures",

At or prior to the closing of\nthe merger, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the payment agent cash that is sufficient in the\naggregate to pay the aggregate per share price to our stockholders in accordance with the merger agreement.\nPromptly (and in any event within one business day) following the effective time of the merger, Parent and the\nsurviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the\neffective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented\noutstanding shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares), a letter of transmittal and instructions\nadvising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates in exchange for merger consideration.

The amount of any per share price paid to our\nstockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of our common stock held in book-entry form (which we refer to\nas \u201cuncertificated shares\u201d) will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal (as both are\ndescribed above) to the payment agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof. Each holder of record\n(as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of uncertificated shares that immediately prior to the\neffective time of the merger represented an outstanding share of our common stock will, upon receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s\nmessage\u201d in customary form at the effective time of the merger, and any documents as may reasonably be requested\nby the payment agent, be entitled to receive, and the payment agent will pay and deliver as promptly as practicable,\nan amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock represented by\nsuch holder\u2019s transferred uncertificated shares\u037e and (2) the per share price. The amount of consideration paid to such\nMedallia stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.\nIf any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the\nmerger, such cash will be returned to Parent upon demand, and any of our stockholders as of immediately prior to the\nmerger who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to\nParent for satisfaction of payment of the merger consideration (subject to abandoned property law, escheat law or\nsimilar laws). None of the payment agent, Parent, the surviving corporation or any other party will be liable to any of\nour stockholder with respect to any cash amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable\nabandoned property law, escheat law or similar laws.\nThe letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has\nbeen stolen or destroyed. In the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then the\npayment agent will issue the per share price to such holder upon the making by such holder of an affidavit for such\nlost, stolen or destroyed certificate. Parent or the payment agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to\nthe payment of the per share price, require such stockholder to deliver a bond in such amount as Parent or the\npayment agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the surviving corporation\nor the payment agent with respect to such certificate.\nRepresentations and Warranties",

If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the\nprovisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as\nnearly as is practicable.\n(d)\u2003Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\n(1)\u2003If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be\nsubmitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting,\nshall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such\nmembers who received notice in accordance with \u00a7\u2002255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal\nrights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or\nall of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1\nof the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7\u2002114 of this title. Each stockholder\nelecting to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking\nof the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares\u037e\nprovided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an\ninformation processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will\nbe sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder\nintends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or\nconsolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a\nseparate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or\nconsolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent\ncorporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or\nconsolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective\u037e or\n(2)\u2003If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \u00a7 228, \u00a7 251(h), \u00a7 253, or \u00a7 267 of this title, then\neither a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or\nresulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of\nsuch constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation\nand that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent\ncorporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a\nnonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of\nthe merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such\nnotice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation\nof the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in\nwriting from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a\ndemand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing\nsystem (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it\nreasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby\nto demand the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date\nof the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the\neffective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such\nconstituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or\n(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10\ndays after such effective date\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days\nfollowing the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title,\nlater than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days following\nthe sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to\nappraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares in accordance with this subsection.\nAn affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to\ngive either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the\nfacts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each\nconstituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date\nthe\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnotice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,\nthe record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective\ndate, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is\ngiven.\n(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or\nany stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled\nto appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a\ndetermination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60\ndays after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand\nfor appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective\ndate of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and\n(d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to\nreceive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the\naggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved\npursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in \u00a7\n251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange\nin, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been\nreceived and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder\nwithin 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting\ncorporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d)\nof this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the\nbeneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may,\nin such person\u2019s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f)\u2003Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving\nor resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in\nwhich the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have\ndemanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached\nby the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the\npetition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall\ngive notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving\nor resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall\nalso be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general\ncirculation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The\nforms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne\nby the surviving or resulting corporation.\n(g)\u2003At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section\nand who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an\nappraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the\nRegister in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails\nto comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before\nthe merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which\nappraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as\nto all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares\nentitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of\nthe consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3)\nthe merger was approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h)\u2003After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal\nproceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive\nB-3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with\ninterest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court\nshall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause\nshown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of\npayment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount\nrate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the\nmerger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the\nsurviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest\nshall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid\nand the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that\ntime. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the\nappraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final\ndetermination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by\nthe surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such\nstockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all\nproceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i)\u2003 The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving\nor resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in\nthe case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates\nupon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court\u2019s decree may be\nenforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation\nbe a corporation of this State or of any state.\n(j)\u2003The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems\nequitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the\nexpenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the\nshares entitled to an appraisal.\n(k)\u2003From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal\nrights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive\npayment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to\nstockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation)\u037e provided,\nhowever, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or\nif such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s\ndemand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective\ndate of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written\napproval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the\napproval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just\u037e provided,\nhowever that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to\naccept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.\n(l)\u2003The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would\nhave been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and\nunissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnnex C",

With respect to the Financial Projections, we have assumed that they have been\nreasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of\nthe Company regarding the future financial performance of the Company. We express no view as to such Financial\nProjections or the assumptions on which they were based.

In the two\nyears prior to the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory and financing services to Thoma Bravo, LLC\n(\u201cThoma Bravo\u201d) (which we understand is the ultimate controlling equity owner of the Parent) and certain of its\naffiliates and their affiliated funds\u2019 respective portfolio companies (collectively the \u201cThoma Bravo Related Entities\u201d),\nand, in each case, have received fees in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide\nfinancial advisory and/or financing services to the Company, Parent, Thoma Bravo and the Thoma Bravo Related\nEntities in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.\nPlease note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management\nand individual wealth management businesses.
