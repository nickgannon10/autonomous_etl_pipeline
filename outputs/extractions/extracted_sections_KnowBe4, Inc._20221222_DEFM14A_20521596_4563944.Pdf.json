KnowBe4 encourages you to carefully read the more detailed\ninformation contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the annexes to this proxy statement and the other documents to which KnowBe4\nrefers in this proxy statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the\ninstructions in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information.\u201d\n \nQ:\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\n \nA:\nOn October 11, 2022, KnowBe4 entered into the Merger Agreement. Under the Merger Agreement, Parent will acquire KnowBe4 for the Per Share\nPrice. In order to complete the Merger, KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders must vote to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special\nMeeting pursuant to the requisite stockholder votes. This approval is a condition to the consummation of the Merger. See the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.\u201d The KnowBe4 Board is furnishing this proxy statement\nand form of proxy card to the holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies of KnowBe4\u2019s\nstockholders to be voted at the Special Meeting.\nThis proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Special\nMeeting and the matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of\nKnowBe4 common stock without attending the Special Meeting and to ensure that your shares of KnowBe4 common stock are represented and\nvoted at the Special Meeting.\nYour vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, KnowBe4 encourages you to submit a proxy as soon as possible.\n \nQ:\nWhat is the Merger and what effects will it have on KnowBe4?\n \nA:\nThe Merger is the acquisition of KnowBe4 by Parent. If the Merger Proposal is approved by KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders and the other closing\nconditions under the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into KnowBe4, with KnowBe4 continuing as the\nsurviving corporation. As a result of the Merger, KnowBe4 will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and KnowBe4 Class A common stock\nwill no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from Nasdaq. In addition, KnowBe4 Class A common stock will be deregistered under the\nExchange Act, and KnowBe4 will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.\n \nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is completed?\n \nA:\nUpon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for\neach share of KnowBe4 common stock that you own (other than the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Shares), unless you have properly perfected\nand exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under the DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL\nare satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of KnowBe4 common stock, you will receive $2,490.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of\nKnowBe4 common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\n \nQ:\nHow does the Per Share Price compare to the market price of the KnowBe4 Class A common stock?\n \nA:\nThis amount constitutes a premium of approximately 44 percent to the unaffected closing price of KnowBe4 Class A common stock of $17.30 per\nshare on September 16, 2022, the last full trading day before Vista publicly disclosed its initial non-binding acquisition proposal.\n \n17Table of Contents\nQ:\nWhat will happen to KnowBe4 RSU Awards, KnowBe4 PSU Awards and KnowBe4 Option Awards?\n \nA:\nGenerally speaking, KnowBe4 RSU Awards, KnowBe4 PSU Awards and KnowBe4 Option Awards will be treated as follows:\n \n\u2022\nAt the effective time of the Merger each KnowBe4 RSU Award and each KnowBe4 PSU Award, to the extent vested but not yet settled as of\nthe effective time of the Merger (or which vests upon the consummation of the Merger), will automatically be canceled and converted into a\nright to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Price and (2) the total number of shares of\nKnowBe4 Class A common stock then subject to the then-vested portion of such award. This amount (less any required withholding and\nother taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the Merger.\n \n\u2022\nAt the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding KnowBe4 RSU Award, to the extent not then vested, will automatically be canceled\nand converted into a contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Price and (2)\nthe total number of shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock subject to the then-unvested portion of such award. This amount (less any\nrequired withholding and other taxes) will vest and be paid out pursuant to the corresponding KnowBe4 RSU Award\u2019s time-based vesting\nschedule, subject to the same terms and conditions (including continued employment) as applied to the KnowBe4 RSU Award immediately\nprior to the effective time of the Merger.\n \n\u2022\nAt the effective time of the Merger, each KnowBe4 PSU Award, to the extent not then vested, will be deemed to have the performance\nmetrics achieved at 100 percent of target, and will be canceled and converted into a contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without\ninterest, equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Price and (2) the total number of shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock subject to the\nthen-unvested portion of such award. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will vest and be paid out pursuant to the\ncorresponding KnowBe4 PSU Award\u2019s time-based vesting schedule, subject to the same terms and conditions (including continued\nemployment conditions but excluding performance vesting conditions) as applied to the KnowBe4 PSU Award immediately prior to the\neffective time of the Merger.\n \n\u2022\nAt the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding KnowBe4 Option Award, to the extent then vested, will be canceled and converted\ninto a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price less the\nexercise price per share of such KnowBe4 Option Award, and (2) the number of shares of KnowBe4 common stock then issuable upon\nexercise in full of such vested KnowBe4 Option Award. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the\napplicable holder promptly following the effective time of the Merger.\n \n\u2022\nAt the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding KnowBe4 Option Award, to the extent not then vested, will be canceled and converted\ninto a contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price\nless the exercise price per share of such KnowBe4 Option Award, and (2) the number of shares of KnowBe4 common stock then issuable\nupon exercise in full of the unvested portion of such KnowBe4 Option Award. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes)\nwill vest and be paid out pursuant to the corresponding KnowBe4 Option Award\u2019s time-based vesting schedule, subject to the same terms\nand conditions (including continued employment) as applied to the KnowBe4 Option Award immediately prior to the effective time of the\nMerger.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen to the ESPP?\n \nA:\nGenerally speaking, the ESPP will be treated as follows:\n \n\u2022\nFrom and after the date of the Merger Agreement, (1) no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP and\n(2) no further contributions will be made to the ESPP by payroll deductions or other methods.\n \n18\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nNo later than November 21, 2022, KnowBe4 will apply any funds within each ESPP participant\u2019s account to the purchase of whole shares of\nKnowBe4 Class A common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. These shares will be deposited into the applicable participant\u2019s\naccount and will be treated in the same manner as any other outstanding share of KnowBe4 Class A common stock in connection with the\nconsummation of the Merger. Any amounts not used for the purchase of shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock will be refunded.\n \nQ:\nWhat am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nYou are being asked to vote on the following proposals:\n \n\u2022\nThe Merger Proposal: the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into KnowBe4,\nwith KnowBe4 continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent\u037e\n \n\u2022\nThe Compensation Proposal: the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become\npayable by KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nThe Adjournment Proposal: the proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if\nnecessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special\nMeeting.\n \nQ:\nWhen and where is the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nThe Special Meeting will take place virtually on January 31, 2023, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time.

You will need the control number found on your proxy card or voting instruction form in order to participate in the Special\nMeeting (including voting your shares).\n \nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nAll of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders as of the close of business on December 7, 2022, which is the Record Date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to\nvote their shares of KnowBe4 common stock at the Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 132,747,542 shares of KnowBe4 Class A\ncommon stock and 44,539,649 shares of KnowBe4 Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. For each share of\nKnowBe4 Class A common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the Record Date, you will have one vote on each matter submitted\nfor a vote at the Special Meeting.

This vote will be on a non-binding, advisory basis.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares cast affirmatively or negatively\non such proposal.\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if I fail to vote or abstain from voting on a proposal?\n \nA:\nIf you (1) are a stockholder of record and fail to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone, or vote your shares at\nthe Special Meeting, or if you (2) hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your\nshares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, and such failure to vote will have the\nsame effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal, but will not have any effect on the outcome of the vote on the Compensation Proposal or\nthe Adjournment Proposal (assuming a quorum is present).\nWith respect to the Merger Proposal, if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence\nof a quorum, but such abstention will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal. With respect to the Compensation\nProposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the\npresence of a quorum, but abstentions are not considered votes cast affirmatively or negatively and therefore will not have any effect on the\noutcome of such proposals.\n \nQ:\nHow will KnowBe4\u2019s directors and executive officers and certain other stockholders vote on the Merger Proposal?\n \nA:\nKnowBe4\u2019s directors and executive officers have informed KnowBe4 that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the\nshares of KnowBe4 common stock owned directly by them in favor of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment\nProposal.

As more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board,\u201d the Special Committee\nevaluated the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, including the Merger, with the assistance of its own independent financial and legal advisors and, where appropriate, KnowBe4\nmanagement and KnowBe4\u2019s outside legal advisor. At the conclusion of its review, the Special Committee, among other things, unanimously (1)\ndetermined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated\nStockholders\u037e and (2) recommended that the KnowBe4 Board approve the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the\nLimited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and determine that the Merger Agreement,\nthe Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nincluding the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated Stockholders.

In specified\ncircumstances in which the Merger Agreement is terminated, Parent has agreed to pay KnowBe4 a reverse termination fee, the payment of which\nhas been guaranteed by the Guarantors. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014\nTermination Fees and Remedies.\u201d\n \nQ:\nWhat is the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\n \nA:\nThe compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to KnowBe4\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger is certain\ncompensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to certain of KnowBe4\u2019s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans\nand arrangements that are contractual in nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by Parent or its affiliates (including, following the\nconsummation of the Merger, the surviving corporation) to KnowBe4\u2019s named executive officers in connection with or following the Merger is not\nsubject to this advisory vote. For further information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 2: The Compensation\nProposal.\u201d\n \nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger?\n \nA:\nKnowBe4 is required to seek approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its\nnamed executive officers in connection with the Merger. Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Merger is not required to consummate the Merger.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen if KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive\nofficers in connection with the Merger?\n \nA:\nApproval of the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is not a\ncondition to consummation of the Merger. This is an advisory vote and will not be binding on KnowBe4 or Parent. The underlying plans and\narrangements providing for such compensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.\nAccordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders and the Merger is consummated, the compensation that will or may\nbecome payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger will or may be paid to KnowBe4\u2019s named executive\nofficers even if KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders do not approve such compensation.\n \nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\n \nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with KnowBe4\u2019s transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with\nrespect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d If you are a stockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been\nsent directly to you by or on behalf of KnowBe4. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the Special Meeting and vote your shares at the\nSpecial Meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of shares of KnowBe4 common stock\nheld in \u201cstreet name.\u201d If you are a beneficial owner of shares of\n \n22\nTable of Contents\nKnowBe4 common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is\nconsidered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record.

However,\nbecause you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the Special Meeting unless you provide a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your\nbank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Special Meeting.\n \nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\n \nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special\nMeeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee to vote your shares.\nIf you do not provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any of the proposals, which\nwill have the same effect as if you voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Compensation\nProposal or the Adjournment Proposal, except to the extent affecting the obtaining of a quorum at the meeting.\n \nQ:\nHow may I vote?\n \nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of KnowBe4 common stock are registered in your name with Computershare Trust\nCompany, N.A., KnowBe4\u2019s transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:\n \n\u2022\nby signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nby visiting the internet address on your proxy card\u037e\n \n\u2022\nby calling the toll-free (within the United States. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nby attending the Special Meeting and voting at the Special Meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.\nThe control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of KnowBe4 common stock\nand to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the internet or by telephone.

You may attend the Special Meeting via live interactive webcast on the internet at http://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/KNBE2023SM.\nYou will be able to listen to the Special Meeting live and vote online. The Special Meeting will begin at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on January 31, 2023.\nOnline check-in will begin a few minutes prior to the Special Meeting. You will need the control number found on your proxy card or voting\ninstruction form in order to participate in the Special Meeting (including voting your shares). As the Special Meeting is virtual, there will be no\nphysical meeting location.\nEven if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Special Meeting, KnowBe4 encourages you to\npromptly sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy\nelectronically over the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card).

Otherwise,\nyou should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form provided by your\nbank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting\nwithout your instructions.\n \nQ:\nWhy did KnowBe4 choose to hold a virtual Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nThe KnowBe4 Board decided to hold the Special Meeting virtually in order to facilitate stockholder attendance and participation by enabling\nstockholders to participate fully, and equally, from virtually any location around the world, at no cost. However, you will bear any costs associated\nwith your internet access, such as usage charges from internet access providers and telephone companies. KnowBe4 believes this is the right\nchoice for a company with a global footprint. A virtual Special Meeting makes it possible for more stockholders (regardless of size, resources or\nphysical location) to have direct access to information, while saving KnowBe4 and its stockholders time and money. KnowBe4 also believes that\nthe online tools that it has selected will increase stockholder communication. KnowBe4 remains very sensitive to concerns that virtual meetings\nmay diminish stockholder voice or reduce accountability. Accordingly, KnowBe4 has designed its virtual format to enhance, rather than constrain,\nstockholder access, participation and communication.\n \nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\n \nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a \u201cproxy,\u201d to vote your shares of KnowBe4 common stock. The written\ndocument describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to\ndesignate a proxy to vote your shares of KnowBe4 common stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d You may follow the instructions on the proxy card to\ndesignate a proxy by telephone or by the Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and returned a proxy card. Sjoerd Sjouwerman\nand Robert Reich, each with full power of substitution and re-substitution, have been designated as proxy holders for the Special Meeting by the\nKnowBe4 Board.\n \nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?\n \nA:\nYes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:\n \n\u2022\nsigning another proxy card with a later date and returning it to KnowBe4 prior to the Special Meeting\u037e\n \n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy\u037e\n \n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation to KnowBe4\u2019s Corporate Secretary\u037e or\n \n24\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nattending the Special Meeting and voting at the Special Meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.\nIf you hold your shares of KnowBe4 common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions\nregarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting if you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other\nnominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Special Meeting.\n \nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\n \nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, with full power of substitution and re-\nsubstitution, will vote your shares in the way that you direct.\nIf you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by\nyour properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the KnowBe4 Board with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be\nvoted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the Merger Proposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the\nAdjournment Proposal, and in the proxyholders\u2019 discretion with respect to any other business that may properly come before the Special Meeting.\n \nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\n \nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to\nsend your stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of KnowBe4 common stock\nrepresented by your stock certificates. Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates\nfor the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you hold your shares of\nKnowBe4 common stock in book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of transmittal. Instead, the payment agent will pay you the appropriate\nportion of the aggregate Per Share Price (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) upon receipt of a customary \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d and any other\nitems specified by the payment agent.\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or transfer my shares of KnowBe4 common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the expected effective date of the Merger. If you sell or\ntransfer your shares of KnowBe4 common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as\nprovision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies KnowBe4 in writing\nof such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Price with respect to such shares, if the Merger is completed, to the\nperson to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or\ntransfer your shares of KnowBe4 common stock after the Record Date, KnowBe4 encourages you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy\ncard (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the\ninstructions found on the proxy card).\n \nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\n \nA:\nPlease sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for) each proxy card and voting instruction form\nthat you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting\ninstruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than\none brokerage account, you will\n \n25\nTable of Contents\nreceive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares\nare registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting materials that you receive.\n \nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nIf available, KnowBe4 may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. KnowBe4 intends to publish final voting\nresults in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that KnowBe4 files with the SEC are\npublicly available when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information.\u201d\n \nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?\n \nA:\nIf you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger\u201d), the exchange of KnowBe4 common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount\nequal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in\nthe shares of KnowBe4 common stock surrendered in the Merger.\nA Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger\u201d) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of KnowBe4 common stock for\ncash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless\nthe Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.\nBecause particular circumstances may differ, KnowBe4 recommends that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax\nlaws or the laws of any territory, state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information only and does not\nconstitute legal advice to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided in\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.\u201d\n \nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\n \nA:\nKnowBe4 currently expects to complete the Merger in 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger, if at all, cannot be predicted\nbecause the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of its control.\n \nQ:\nWhat governmental and regulatory approvals are required?\n \nA:\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act\nhas expired or been terminated. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on November 25, 2022.\n \nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?\n \nA:\nIf the Merger is consummated and certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied, holders of record and beneficial owners\nof KnowBe4 common stock who (1) do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal (whether by voting against the Merger Proposal, abstaining or\notherwise not voting with respect to the Merger Proposal)\u037e (2) continuously hold (in the case of holders of record) or continuously own\n \n26\nTable of Contents\n(in the case of beneficial owners) their applicable shares of KnowBe4 common stock through the effective date of the Merger\u037e (3) properly demand\nappraisal of their applicable shares\u037e (4) meet certain statutory requirements as described in this proxy statement\u037e and (5) do not withdraw their\ndemands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262\nof the DGCL. This means that such holders of record and beneficial owners will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising\nfrom the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise\nfor good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the Merger\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded\nquarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to\neach person seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair\nvalue of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving\ncorporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons who wish to seek appraisal of\ntheir shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal\nprocess. The DGCL requirements for perfecting and exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cAppraisal Rights,\u201d which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, which\nm a y  b e  a c c e s s e d  w i t h o u t  s u b s c r i p t i o n  o r  c o s t  a t  t h e  f o l l o w i n g  p u b l i c l y  a v a i l a b l e  w e b s i t e :\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.\n \nQ:\nDo any of KnowBe4\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders generally?\n \nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendations of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board with respect to the Merger, you should be aware that,\naside from their interests as holders of KnowBe4 common stock and equity awards, KnowBe4\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests\nin the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. This chronology does not purport\nto catalogue every conversation of or among the KnowBe4 Board, the Special Committee, the representatives of KnowBe4 or the Special Committee,\nor other parties, including Vista and the Rollover Stockholders.\nThe KnowBe4 Board regularly evaluates KnowBe4\u2019s strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward strengthening KnowBe4\u2019s\nbusiness and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the KnowBe4 Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic\nalternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, our current business plan, with KnowBe4\nremaining an independent entity\u037e (2) the investment in, and development of, new products and services, and expansion into new markets\u037e (3) capital\nraising activities\u037e (4) potential expansion opportunities through acquisitions, partnerships or other commercial relationships\u037e and (5) business\ncombinations and other financial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of KnowBe4.\nVista, through the VEPF funds, first became an investor in KnowBe4 prior to KnowBe4\u2019s initial public offering in 2021 (the \u201cIPO\u201d). Prior to that\ninvestment, Vista and KnowBe4 discussed, in general terms, a variety of different transactions, including the possible acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista.\nThese discussions never advanced beyond the preliminary stage. Vista, through the VEPF funds, purchased additional shares of KnowBe4 Class A\ncommon stock as a participant in the IPO. In addition to conversations with Vista pre-IPO, KnowBe4 had a small number of high-level conversations with\nother potential acquirors.\nOn May 6, 2021, Vista, through the VEPF Funds, filed a Schedule 13D that reflected its ownership of KnowBe4 common stock.\nOn May 20, 2022 and June 1, 2022, Stephen Shanley, a member of the KnowBe4 Board and an employee of KKR, spoke with representatives of Vista at\nVista\u2019s request, in connection with Vista\u2019s routine process for evaluating its current investments. During these conversations, the parties discussed\nKnowBe4\u2019s business and the industry generally, and the representatives of Vista discussed potential opportunities for the company, including raising\nwhether the company was potentially interested in pursuing a sale transaction.\nOn May 26, 2022, Krish Venkataraman, a member of the KnowBe4 Board, and representatives of Vista spoke in connection with Vista\u2019s routine process for\nevaluating its current investments. During this conversation, the parties discussed KnowBe4\u2019s business. The parties did not discuss any potential\nacquisition of KnowBe4 at this time.\nOn June 8, 2022, Jeremiah Daly, a member of the KnowBe4 Board and the co-founder and general partner of Elephant, spoke with representatives of Vista\nat Vista\u2019s request, in connection with Vista\u2019s routine process for evaluating its current investments. During this meeting, the parties discussed KnowBe4\u2019s\nbusiness and the industry generally, and a representative of Vista discussed potential opportunities for the company, including raising whether the\ncompany was potentially interested in pursuing a sale transaction.\nFollowing these discussions, Messrs. Shanley and Daly both recommended that representatives of Vista meet with Sjoerd Sjouwerman, Chairperson of\nthe KnowBe4 Board and Chief Executive Officer of KnowBe4, whom they had never met in person.\nOn June 16, 2022, Messrs. Shanley, Daly and Sjouwerman spoke with representatives of Vista, at Vista\u2019s request, in connection with Vista\u2019s routine\nprocess for evaluating its current investments. During this meeting, the parties discussed KnowBe4\u2019s business and the industry generally, and a\nrepresentative of Vista discussed potential opportunities for the company, including raising whether the company was potentially interested in pursuing a\nsale transaction.\n \n28Table of Contents\nOn June 22, 2022, Messrs. Daly and Sjouwerman met in person with representatives of Vista. During this meeting, the representatives of Vista discussed,\nin general terms, the industry in which KnowBe4 operates and Vista\u2019s existing investment in KnowBe4. During this conversation, representatives of Vista\nexpressed their confidence in KnowBe4\u2019s business and indicated that if KnowBe4 were ever to be interested in a transaction, Vista would want to be\nincluded. The representatives of Vista did not propose an acquisition or any other transaction involving KnowBe4 or discuss any potential acquisition\nterms during this meeting.\nOn June 22, 2022, Mr. Daly reached out to a representative at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation (\u201cWilson Sonsini\u201d), outside\nlegal advisor to KnowBe4, to inform them as to the conversations with Vista up to that point. Wilson Sonsini then coordinated a special meeting of the\nBoard on June 28, 2022. At that meeting, the KnowBe4 Board discussed the recent conversations between certain Board members and Vista and\nconfirmed that the participants in those meetings did not engage in any discussions regarding any economic or other terms of a potential transaction.\nRepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the KnowBe4 Board\u2019s fiduciary duties and obligations in connection with a potential sale of KnowBe4 and\ndiscussed certain potential conflicts of interest that could arise in connection with the exploration of a potential sale. Each of Messrs. Sjouwerman, Daly\nand Shanley indicated that, if Vista were interested in acquiring KnowBe4 and there was an opportunity for them to rollover equity in such transactions,\nsuch individual or the entities that they represent (as applicable) may be interested in \u201crolling\u201d all or a part of their equity interests in KnowBe4 in such a\ntransaction. In response to such expressions of interest, representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed the merits of forming a special committee of the\nKnowBe4 Board to oversee any efforts by KnowBe4 to explore or pursue a potential sale of KnowBe4.\nOn July 5, 2022, the KnowBe4 Board held a special meeting by video conference with representatives of Wilson Sonsini. At the request of the KnowBe4\nBoard, representatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an overview of, among other things, (1) the KnowBe4 Board\u2019s fiduciary duties\u037e (2) the potential\nconflicts of interest involving members of the KnowBe4 Board with respect to a potential sale of KnowBe4, including if any of the existing significant\nstockholders of KnowBe4 elected to rollover any portion of their equity in KnowBe4 in a potential transaction\u037e (3) approaches for mitigating or\nneutralizing such conflicts of interest, including creating a special committee of independent and disinterested members of the KnowBe4 Board, including\nthe relevance of Kahn v. M&F Worldwide Corp. and its progeny (\u201cMFW\u201d) to a potential transaction\u037e (4) the disclosure obligations of a Schedule 13D\nfiler in the context of potential strategic discussions\u037e and (5) an overview of Rule 13e-3 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 and its potential\napplication to a possible transaction. The KnowBe4 Board determined that a sale of KnowBe4 could be attractive and merited further consideration,\nincluding as a result of general conditions in the market overall. The KnowBe4 Board determined to form the Special Committee for the purposes of\nreviewing, evaluating and, if appropriate, negotiating a strategic transaction, which could involve a sale of KnowBe4. After discussion at the meeting, the\nKnowBe4 Board determined that each of Gerhard Watzinger, Kevin Klausmeyer and Krish Venkataraman were independent and disinterested for purposes\nof a possible transaction with Vista and appointed them to the Special Committee. The KnowBe4 Board requested additional time for consideration and\nreview of the scope of authority and other related matters for the Special Committee. Immediately following the completion of the KnowBe4 Board\nmeeting, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference to discuss the retention of legal and financial advisors to advise the Special\nCommittee. Members of the KnowBe4 Board and representatives of Wilson Sonsini also attended this meeting. The Special Committee determined to\ncontact the representatives of Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP (\u201cPotter Anderson\u201d) and Morgan Stanley to ask each advisor to interview with the\nSpecial Committee to serve as the Special Committee\u2019s independent legal advisor and financial advisor, respectively. The Special Committee did not seek\nto interview any other advisors at this time.\nOn July 7, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of Potter Anderson to interview Potter Anderson to serve\nas its independent legal advisor and to discuss the Special Committee\u2019s process. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also attended a portion of the\nmeeting to interview to serve as the Special Committee\u2019s independent financial advisor and to discuss the Special\n \n29\nTable of Contents\nCommittee\u2019s process. Representatives of Potter Anderson provided the Special Committee with an overview of a number of process-related matters,\nincluding discussing the scope of the Special Committee\u2019s expected mandate, the relevance of MFW to a potential transaction, and the engagement of an\nindependent financial advisor to advise the Special Committee. Representatives of Potter Anderson also reviewed Potter Anderson\u2019s independence and\nqualifications, experience and expertise. Representatives of Morgan Stanley joined the meeting and provided the Special Committee with an overview of\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s independence and qualifications, experience and expertise, including with respect to serving as a financial advisor to technology,\ncybersecurity and software companies, advising companies on M&A transactions and serving as an independent financial advisor to special committees\nof boards of directors. Following Morgan Stanley\u2019s departure from the meeting, the Special Committee discussed Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications,\nexperience and expertise, Morgan Stanley\u2019s prior experience in serving as an advisor to KnowBe4, and its earlier discussions with Morgan Stanley at the\nmeeting. Following such discussion, the Special Committee determined to engage Morgan Stanley, subject to (1) receipt of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nrelationships disclosure memorandum and the Special Committee\u2019s satisfaction with the independence of Morgan Stanley\u037e and (2) the negotiation of a\nmutually acceptable engagement letter. Given Morgan Stanley\u2019s experience, expertise and qualifications and familiarity with KnowBe4, the Special\nCommittee determined not to interview other potential financial advisors.\nFollowing this meeting, the Special Committee also determined to engage Potter Anderson as its independent legal advisor and an engagement letter with\nPotter Anderson was executed on July 7, 2022.\nOn July 11, 2022, the KnowBe4 Board adopted, by unanimous written consent, resolutions setting forth the formal delineation of the scope of the\nKnowBe4 Board\u2019s delegation of authority to the Special Committee which empowered the Special Committee to, among other things, review, evaluate and\nnegotiate the structure, form, terms and conditions of (1) a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 and (2) any potential acquisition of KnowBe4 that included a\ntransaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders of KnowBe4 may have an interest that is in addition to, and/or\ndifferent from, the interests of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders as a whole (such a transaction, a \u201cSpecified Transaction\u201d). The resolutions provided that the\nKnowBe4 Board would not approve, or recommend for approval by KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders, a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 or a Specified\nTransaction without a prior favorable recommendation by the Special Committee. The resolutions further provided that the Special Committee had the\nauthority to select and engage its own advisors and that KnowBe4 would not effectuate a Specified Transaction unless it had first been approved or\nrecommended by the Special Committee and approved by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 held by\nthe disinterested stockholders (as determined by the Special Committee). Finally, the resolutions provided that the Chairperson of the Special Committee\nwould be Mr. Watzinger, who would receive compensation of $39,000 per month, and the other members of the Special Committee would receive\ncompensation of $36,000 per month, with such amounts payable regardless of the determinations reached by the Special Committee and in no way\ncontingent on the Special Committee approving or recommending a potential transaction.\nOn July 12, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered Morgan Stanley\u2019s customary relationships disclosures memorandum to the Special\nCommittee, which provided an overview of Morgan Stanley\u2019s relationships (or lack thereof) with KnowBe4, Vista and certain of its affiliates, KKR and\ncertain of its affiliates, and Elephant Funds and certain of their affiliates.\nOn July 13, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of Potter Anderson.

Representatives of Potter Anderson conducted an additional independence review of the Special Committee members and, after\nsuch review, the Special Committee concluded that each member was independent and disinterested for purposes of evaluating a potential acquisition of\nthe Company.\n \n30\nTable of Contents\nRepresentatives of Potter Anderson also reviewed with the Special Committee its mandate from the KnowBe4 Board. The Special Committee and\nrepresentatives of Potter Anderson discussed certain preliminary valuation considerations involving KnowBe4 and a potential transaction, as well as\ncertain initial price discovery strategies and considerations. The Special Committee and representatives of Potter Anderson also reviewed Morgan\nStanley\u2019s relationships disclosure memorandum and Morgan Stanley\u2019s draft engagement letter. Following such review, the Special Committee determined\nthat no conflicts had been disclosed in Morgan Stanley\u2019s relationship disclosure memorandum that would affect the ability of Morgan Stanley to fulfill its\nresponsibilities as an independent financial advisor to the Special Committee and to engage Morgan Stanley as the Special Committee\u2019s independent\nfinancial advisor. The Special Committee executed an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley on July 15, 2022.\nOn July 14, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley to\ndiscuss certain initial process matters for the Special Committee\u2019s consideration of a potential acquisition of the Company, including (1) an initial outreach\nto representatives of Vista and the substance of the communication for such initial outreach\u037e (2) price discovery considerations for a potential\nacquisition\u037e (3) Vista\u2019s potential public disclosure obligations\u037e and (4) the roles of KKR and Elephant Funds in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4,\nincluding whether either would be interested in an independent bid for KnowBe4, whether either anticipated being a \u201cseller-only\u201d in a potential\nacquisition, or whether either contemplated rolling some or all of their equity in a potential acquisition. In addition, the representatives of Morgan Stanley\nalso provided Morgan Stanley\u2019s preliminary view as to the most likely potential strategic parties and financial sponsor acquirers of KnowBe4, which\npotential acquirers were arranged in certain tiers, based on (1) Morgan Stanley\u2019s judgment and experience\u037e (2) the strategic fit of KnowBe4 with each\npotential acquirer\u037e and (3) the ability and likelihood of each potential acquirer to engage in, and consummate, an acquisition of KnowB4. The Special\nCommittee, after discussion at the meeting, authorized Morgan Stanley to have a preliminary discussion with Vista regarding Vista\u2019s interest in acquiring\nKnowBe4 and to convey to Vista that any transaction proposed by Vista in which certain significant existing stockholders of KnowBe4 would roll some\nor all of their equity in KnowBe4 would have to be made subject to, and conditioned upon, the MFW framework.\nLater that day, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Vista to discuss whether Vista would be interested in exploring a potential\nacquisition of KnowBe4. Representatives of Vista reiterated that Vista was evaluating its existing investment in KnowBe4, and noted that it would be\nopen to exploratory conversations regarding a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. Vista noted that, in the case of a potential acquisition scenario, while\nVista would likely be open to exploratory discussions regarding certain stockholders of KnowBe4 rolling their equity interests in KnowBe4, if Vista\ndetermined it was interested in pursuing a potential transaction it would not expect to condition any such possible transaction on any stockholder rolling\na specific amount of equity. The representatives of Morgan Stanley and Vista did not discuss any specific terms or valuation with respect to a potential\ntransaction.\nOn July 18, 2022, representatives of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP (\u201cGibson Dunn\u201d), outside legal advisor to KKR, met with representatives of Potter\nAnderson to discuss a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, during which meeting Gibson Dunn conveyed that KKR anticipated that it would be supportive\nof a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, subject to agreement on acceptable terms, and that under certain circumstances and subject to obtaining all\nrequired internal approvals, KKR or its affiliates would consider maintaining an equity interest in KnowBe4 in connection with any such potential\nacquisition, including in connection with a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista.\nAlso on July 18, 2022, representatives of Vista met with representatives of Morgan Stanley to convey that Vista wanted to have six weeks for due\ndiligence before Vista would be able to complete its evaluation of its existing investment in KnowBe4 and to determine, among other possibilities, whether\nor not it was interested in potentially submitting a proposal to the Special Committee. Representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and Vista also\ndiscussed Vista\u2019s public disclosure obligations and the impact of amending Vista\u2019s existing non-disclosure\n \n31\nTable of Contents\nagreement with KnowBe4, which was entered into on March 12, 2020 prior to the IPO, for the purposes of exploration of a possible sale or investment\ntransaction in connection with its diligence for its evaluation of its existing investment in KnowBe4. This non-disclosure agreement did not include a\n\u201cstandstill\u201d or other restriction on Vista\u2019s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire KnowBe4.\nLater on July 18, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.\nRepresentatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley reported on their communications with Gibson Dunn and Vista, respectively.\nRepresentatives of Potter Anderson reviewed the nature of KKR\u2019s potential conflict of interest. Representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed certain\nprocess and procedural matters, including the scope of an initial outreach to potential bidders other than Vista and the advantages of contacting other\npotential bidders at this juncture. Representatives of Morgan Stanley recommended that the Special Committee conduct an initial, limited outreach to four\npotential bidders at this time regarding a potential interest in an acquisition of KnowBe4. The initial four potential bidders contacted consisted of four\nfinancial sponsors (including two financial sponsors that owned strategic parties to KnowBe4), which Morgan Stanley had identified as the potential\nbidders that would likely have a significant level of interest in KnowBe4 and were the most likely to engage in, and complete, an acquisition of KnowBe4.\nThe Special Committee and its advisors discussed additional process matters, including the ramifications of any public disclosure concerning Vista\u2019s\npotential interest in acquiring KnowBe4 at this juncture and the need to work with KnowBe4 management to receive KnowBe4 management\u2019s long-term\nfinancial projections for KnowBe4. After discussion at the meeting, the Special Committee authorized (1) Potter Anderson to contact Wilson Sonsini to\ndiscuss the process for approving management\u2019s long-term financial projections and Vista\u2019s potential public disclosure considerations\u037e (2) Morgan\nStanley to conduct an outreach to four identified financial sponsors to gauge their respective interest in pursuing a potential acquisition of KnowBe4\u037e\nand (3) Morgan Stanley to conduct an additional outreach to Mr. Shanley to confirm KKR\u2019s position with respect to a potential acquisition of KnowBe4.\nIn the days following the Special Committee meeting on July 18, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley, acting upon the authorization of the Special\nCommittee, conducted an outreach to the four financial sponsors previously discussed with the Special Committee. Based on the feedback and interest\nreceived following the initial outreach to the four potential bidders and a continual evaluation of the market outreach conducted by Morgan Stanley,\nincluding reports and updates from Morgan Stanley on the feedback received from potential bidders, the Special Committee, during its meetings on July\n28, 2022 and August 4, 2022, authorized the representatives of Morgan Stanley to contact additional financial sponsors and strategic parties regarding\nsuch sponsors\u2019 and parties\u2019 potential interest in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. The decision to contact those additional financial sponsors and\nstrategic parties at those respective times reflected recommendations from Morgan Stanley on those financial sponsors and strategic parties that would\nlikely have an interest in KnowBe4 and would be capable of engaging in, and completing, an acquisition of KnowBe4, albeit in a descending order of\ninterest in KnowBe4 and/or in capability of engaging in, and completing, an acquisition. This decision also reflected, among other things, the level of\ninterest shown, the engagement (or the lack thereof) by potential bidders (including by the four potential bidders initially contacted), the number of\npotential bidders in the process at any given time, and that potential bidders had passed on pursuing a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 at various\njunctures in the Special Committee\u2019s process. The other potential financial sponsor and strategic party bidders passed on pursuing a potential acquisition\nof KnowBe4 for, among other reasons in the aggregate, (1) questions about the ultimate size of the total available market, (2) current and future\ncompetition, (3) challenges with respect to future growth at-scale, (4) high exposure to small and midsize business market and (5) technology content and\ndifferentiation\u037e (6) such bidder\u2019s lack of a compelling rationale for an acquisition\u037e and/or (7) such bidder\u2019s view that it could not see itself paying a\nmeaningful premium in an acquisition based on KnowBe4\u2019s current market trading price. In the aggregate, the representatives of Morgan Stanley\ncontacted 12 financial sponsors (not including Vista), including two financial sponsors that owned strategic parties, and four strategic parties to\ndetermine their interest in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. Nine of the non-Vista financial sponsors contacted executed non-disclosure agreements to\nallow them to engage further with KnowBe4 regarding a potential acquisition. These non-disclosure agreements included a \u201cstandstill\u201d or other\nrestriction on the\n \n32\nTable of Contents\napplicable financial sponsor\u2019s ability to make public proposals to acquire KnowBe4 but such restrictions would fall away under certain circumstances,\nincluding the date that KnowBe4 announces a definitive written agreement with any unaffiliated third party (or, in some cases, just a third party) to\nconsummate a transaction that would result in such third party obtaining a majority of the outstanding number of KnowBe4\u2019s voting securities. However,\nall of these non-disclosure agreements permitted the applicable financial sponsor to make a direct proposal to the KnowBe4 Board, provided that it was\non a confidential, non-public basis. Eight of the non-Vista financial sponsors contacted had an initial meeting with KnowBe4 management to discuss\nKnowBe4\u2019s business and operations. Two of the non-Vista financial sponsors contacted submitted additional due diligence requests on KnowBe4\nfollowing the initial management presentation, all of which were responded to by management. However, following the delivery of these responses, each\nof these non-Vista financial sponsors declined to pursue a transaction and did not submit a proposal or access a virtual data room. No financial sponsors\n(other than Vista) ultimately submitted a proposal for a potential acquisition. None of the strategic bidders contacted executed a non-disclosure\nagreement, held an initial meeting with KnowBe4 management, conducted due diligence on KnowBe4, or submitted an acquisition proposal.\nOn July 21, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with Mr. Shanley, who indicated that KKR would not pursue a full acquisition of KnowBe4. Mr.\nShanley also indicated that, subject to obtaining all required internal approvals, KKR or its affiliates would consider maintaining an equity interest in\nKnowBe4 in connection with a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista, but could not commit to maintaining an equity interest in KnowBe4 in\nconnection with any other potential acquisition of KnowBe4 without knowing the identity of the acquiror in any such transaction.\nOn July 24, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.\nRepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini also participated for a portion of the meeting to discuss (1) whether to amend Vista\u2019s current non-disclosure\nagreement\u037e and (2) potential disclosure obligations in connection with Vista\u2019s exploration of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. The Special Committee\nauthorized representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Wilson Sonsini to contact Vista\u2019s outside legal advisor to discuss considerations with respect\nto Vista\u2019s exploration of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. Following Wilson Sonsini\u2019s departure from the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley\nprovided an update on its initial outreach to the non-Vista potential bidders and reported on their discussion with Mr. Shanley concerning KKR\u2019s views\non participation in a transaction.\nOn July 26, 2022, representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini, Gibson Dunn and Latham & Watkins LLP (\u201cLatham\u201d), outside legal advisor\nto Elephant Funds, held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Special Committee\u2019s process generally. The representatives of Gibson Dunn and Latham\nrequested that the representatives of Potter Anderson and Wilson Sonsini provide periodic updates, as determined to be appropriate by the Special\nCommittee, with respect to the Special Committee\u2019s progress and transaction matters.\nOn July 27, 2022, representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d), outside legal advisor to Vista, held\nan introductory meeting to discuss the process and timeline for Vista\u2019s exploration of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4.\nOn July 28, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley provided an overview of certain process matters for a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, including a process timeline\nfor potential bidders, including Vista. The Special Committee and representatives of Potter Anderson also discussed considerations related to Vista\u2019s\npublic disclosure obligations, as informed by discussions with Wilson Sonsini, given Vista\u2019s existing Schedule 13D filing. The Special Committee and its\nadvisors also discussed providing periodic updates to Latham and Gibson Dunn, generally, on the Special Committee\u2019s progress and transaction matters.\nAfter discussion of the benefits and considerations of such updates, including that the Special Committee believed that it was prudent to keep the two\nlargest stockholders of KnowBe4 who collectively owned a majority of the voting\n \n33\nTable of Contents\npower of the Company generally apprised of the Special Committee\u2019s progress and transaction matters, the Special Committee directed Potter Anderson\nto provide Latham and Gibson Dunn with periodic, general updates on the Special Committee\u2019s process. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then (1)\nprovided an update on Morgan Stanley\u2019s communications with Vista and the other four potential bidders that Morgan Stanley had contacted\u037e (2)\ndiscussed Morgan Stanley\u2019s preliminary views on KnowBe4\u2019s valuation based on historical or publicly available information\u037e and (3) reviewed a number\nof KnowBe4-specific and market-specific financial benchmarks. The Special Committee and its advisors then discussed KnowBe4\u2019s current stock price, a\nrange of potential illustrative transaction prices, the implied premiums resulting from such illustrative transaction prices, and how this analysis may\nimpact preliminary price communications with Vista. As discussed earlier in this background section, the Special Committee, acting upon the\nrecommendation of Morgan Stanley, authorized the representatives of Morgan Stanley to contact an additional set of financial sponsors and a set of\nstrategic parties regarding their potential interest in an acquisition of KnowBe4, which such recommendation reflected Morgan Stanley\u2019s belief that those\nfinancial sponsors and strategic parties would likely have an interest in KnowBe4 and would be capable of engaging in, and completing, an acquisition of\nKnowBe4.\nConsistent with the Special Committee\u2019s authorization, representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini, Gibson Dunn and Latham held\nperiodic meetings throughout the Special Committee\u2019s process to discuss, generally, the Special Committee\u2019s progress and transaction matters. The\nSpecial Committee also provided the KnowBe4 Board with periodic updates throughout the Special Committee\u2019s process, which updates discussed,\ngenerally, the Special Committee\u2019s progress and transaction matters. In connection with these updates, the Special Committee requested that the members\nof the KnowBe4 Board not have any discussions with Vista, or other potential counterparties, independently from the Special Committee.\nOn July 29, 2022, representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland met to discuss (1) amending Vista\u2019s existing non-disclosure\nagreement with KnowBe4 in order to allow Vista to receive diligence information in connection with its evaluation of its existing investment in KnowBe4\nand, among other possibilities, potential exploratory discussions with respect to an acquisition of KnowBe4, and (2) other process considerations,\nincluding potential public disclosure obligations if Vista were to decide to pursue an acquisition, including making a proposal to acquire KnowBe4.\nRepresentatives of Kirkland conveyed that Vista was prepared to amend its existing non-disclosure agreement to (1) provide the Special Committee with a\nconsent right before Vista spoke with potential sources of debt or equity financing, including discussions with existing stockholders of KnowBe4\nregarding a potential rollover, for any potential acquisition\u037e and (2) grant KnowBe4 the advance right to review and comment on any Schedule 13D filing\nby Vista. The representatives of Kirkland conveyed, however, that Vista did not wish to extend the term beyond the approximately six-month period\nremaining on the existing non-disclosure agreement.\nAlso, on July 29, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with a representative of Potter Anderson to discuss process matters\nrelating to an upcoming update to Mr. Sjouwerman. The Special Committee determined that it would provide Mr. Sjouwerman with (1) a high level,\nprocess-focused overview of the Special Committee\u2019s work to date\u037e (2) the list of names of the financial sponsors and strategic bidders that the Special\nCommittee had instructed Morgan Stanley to approach\u037e and (3) an overview of an illustrative timeline for a potential acquisition.\nOn August 2, 2022, a representative of Morgan Stanley contacted a representative of Vista and requested that Vista extend the term for the proposed\namendment to Vista\u2019s non-disclosure agreement from a period of approximately six months to one year from the date it was entered into. A representative\nof Vista confirmed that such request was acceptable to Vista.\nOn August 4, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.\nRepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini also attended a portion of the meeting. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reported on Potter Anderson and Wilson\nSonsini\u2019s communications with Kirkland in respect of a possible amendment to Vista\u2019s existing non-disclosure agreement. The Special\n \n34\nTable of Contents\nCommittee and representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed the proposed terms for the amendment, and, after discussion, the Special Committee\nauthorized representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Potter Anderson to draft and negotiate the amendment. The Special Committee and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini discussed the timing for holding preliminary pricing discussions, and the Special Committee noted that it wanted to\navoid unnecessary expenses and management distractions if there was not a possible deal at an attractive price. Following Wilson Sonsini\u2019s departure\nfrom the meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed a potential update meeting involving the Special Committee and Messrs. Shanley and\nDaly. The Special Committee and its advisors further discussed the scope of the topics for that informational, update meeting and it was determined that\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley would also attend this meeting. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Special Committee with a process\noverview, an overview of an illustrative process timeline, and a review of the potential bidders contacted. As discussed earlier in this background section,\nthe Special Committee, acting upon the recommendation of Morgan Stanley, authorized the representatives of Morgan Stanley to contact an additional\nset of financial sponsors regarding their potential interest in an acquisition of KnowBe4, which such recommendation reflected Morgan Stanley\u2019s belief\nthat those financial sponsors would likely have an interest in KnowBe4 and would be capable of engaging in, and completing, an acquisition of\nKnowBe4.\nOn August 5, 2022, the Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with Messrs. Shanley and Daly to update them, generally, on the\nSpecial Committee\u2019s process and expected timeline for such process.\nAlso on August 5, 2022, representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland met to discuss an amendment to Vista\u2019s existing non-\ndisclosure agreement with KnowBe4.\nLater on August 5, 2022, KnowBe4 management provided the Special Committee with management\u2019s draft three-year financial projections for KnowBe4\nfor use in connection with the Special Committee\u2019s consideration of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (the \u201cManagement Plan\u201d). From August 6, 2022,\nthrough August 8, 2022, the Special Committee and members of KnowBe4 management discussed and reviewed the Management Plan. Following such\ndiscussion and review, the Special Committee approved the Management Plan.\nOn August 8, 2022, the KnowBe4 Board held a special meeting by video conference with Robert Reich, Chief Financial Officer of KnowBe4, and\nrepresentatives of each of Potter Anderson and Wilson Sonsini. Mr. Watzinger provided the KnowBe4 Board with an overview of the work performed by\nKnowBe4 management on the Management Plan and noted that the Special Committee had the opportunity to review and discuss the assumptions\nembedded in the Management Plan with KnowBe4 management. Mr. Watzinger noted that the next step in the Special Committee\u2019s process was to present\nthe Management Plan to the KnowBe4 Board for its review and, if the KnowBe4 Board was supportive of the Management Plan, then it would be\nprovided to Morgan Stanley and could be shared with potential bidders (including Vista) that had executed a non-disclosure agreement in connection\nwith a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. Members of KnowBe4 management provided an overview of the Management Plan and members of the\nKnowBe4 Board asked questions and provided feedback. After discussion at the meeting, including a review of the Special Committee\u2019s and KnowBe4\nmanagement\u2019s recommendation, the KnowBe4 Board approved the use of the Management Plan in connection with the Special Committee\u2019s consideration\nof a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, and authorized its sharing with potential bidders (including Vista) that had executed a non-disclosure agreement\nand its use by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its financial analysis of KnowBe4.\nAlso on August 8, 2022, KnowBe4 and Vista entered into an amendment to Vista\u2019s existing non-disclosure agreement with KnowBe4. Vista began its due\ndiligence discussions with KnowBe4 on this date, including for purposes of evaluating its existing investment in KnowBe4 and evaluating whether it\nwould potentially be interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, and held meetings with members of KnowBe4 management and\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley, to further understand KnowBe4\u2019s business.\nOn August 11, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an informal briefing to the Special Committee on Vista\u2019s progress and the progress of\nother potential bidders.\n \n35\nTable of Contents\nFollowing this briefing, on August 11, 2022, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting. The Special Committee discussed the briefing that it had\nreceived from Morgan Stanley earlier in the day and (1) reviewed Vista\u2019s engagement in due diligence on KnowBe4\u037e (2) discussed Morgan Stanley\u2019s\noutreach to potential bidders for an acquisition of KnowBe4\u037e and (3) noted that meetings had been scheduled between certain of such potential bidders\nand KnowBe4 management over the next two weeks. The Special Committee also reviewed the feedback that Morgan Stanley had received from certain\npotential strategic bidders regarding a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, including that, while the strategic parties had positive views of KnowBe4 and\nKnowBe4\u2019s business, they did not see a compelling rationale for acquiring the business.\nOn August 17, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley reported on Morgan Stanley\u2019s outreach efforts to potential bidders for an acquisition of KnowBe4 and reviewed\nthose potential bidders that remained in the process at this time and those bidders that had passed on pursuing an acquisition of KnowBe4 at this time.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley also reported on Vista\u2019s due diligence progress, the due diligence progress of the other potential bidders and the\nstatus of Vista\u2019s due diligence progress relative to other potential bidders. The Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the\nfeedback that Morgan Stanley had received from financial sponsors and strategic bidders, including those that had either passed on pursuing an\nacquisition of KnowBe4 or had not expressed a continuing interest in pursuing an acquisition of KnowBe4. The Special Committee and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley discussed when in the Special Committee\u2019s process it would be appropriate to signal the Special Committee\u2019s general views on valuation\nfor a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 to potential bidders, and discussed the timing for seeking bids from potential bidders. Representatives of Morgan\nStanley also provided an update on Morgan Stanley\u2019s work on its preliminary financial analyses of KnowBe4 and the types of financial analyses that\nMorgan Stanley had considered utilizing. The Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the management presentations held to\ndate and certain process matters in connection therewith, including that representatives of Morgan Stanley should hold periodic meetings with Mr.\nSjouwerman to receive his input on the potential acquisition of KnowBe4.\nOn August 19, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley (1) provided an update on Morgan Stanley\u2019s outreach efforts to potential bidders for a potential acquisition of\nKnowBe4\u037e (2) reviewed the due diligence progress of Vista and the other potential bidders\u037e and (3) reviewed the feedback received from potential bidders,\nincluding (a) certain positive attributes of KnowBe4, which were noted to be (i) growth above its peer group at greater than 35 percent year-over-year, (ii)\na highly recurring business model, (iii) strong profits, and (iv) a category leader, and (b) certain considerations regarding KnowBe4, which were noted to\nbe (i) questions about the ultimate size of the total available market, (ii) current and future competition, (iii) challenges with respect to future growth at-\nscale, (iv) high exposure to small and midsize business market, and (iv) technology content and differentiation. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also\nreviewed with the Special Committee Morgan Stanley\u2019s preliminary financial analyses of KnowBe4, including the valuation methodologies utilized and the\nvalue ranges produced under such methodologies. The Special Committee and its advisors also discussed whether this was the appropriate time in the\nSpecial Committee\u2019s process to convey the Special Committee\u2019s views on valuation to Vista. In that regard, the Special Committee noted that the Special\nCommittee\u2019s process was utilizing KnowBe4 resources and KnowBe4 management\u2019s time, and that it would not make sense to proceed further with Vista\nunless Vista was prepared to submit a proposal at a price that the Special Committee found attractive. The Special Committee discussed its views on\nvaluation, including that it believed that a transaction with a value in the mid-to-high $20\u2019s per share range was appropriate for a potential acquisition of\nKnowBe4 based upon, among other things, Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analysis and the Special Committee\u2019s views on KnowBe4\u2019s business, and that it\ndid not make sense to proceed further with Vista, given Vista\u2019s existing knowledge of KnowBe4 and its due diligence progress at that point in time, unless\nit shared a similar view to the Special Committee on valuation. After discussion at the meeting, the Special Committee authorized representatives of\nMorgan Stanley to convey the Special Committee\u2019s view and message on valuation to Vista following its meeting and to other potential bidders at the\nappropriate time as determined by Morgan Stanley in its professional judgment.\n \n36\nTable of Contents\nWhile other potential bidders remained in the process at this time, such bidders had shown only preliminary levels of interest in an acquisition of\nKnowBe4, and no other potential bidder had shown the level of engagement that Vista had shown at this time. Therefore, no other potential bidder\nreceived the Special Committee\u2019s view and message on valuation at this time. No potential bidder (other than Vista) would go on to demonstrate a\nsignificant level of engagement. As a result, the Special Committee did not believe there was any benefit to shifting its perspective on valuation with\npotential bidders that had expressed only a preliminary level of interest in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (if any interest at all) and given the\npotential risks to the Special Committee\u2019s process of sharing such information, no other potential bidder received the Special Committee\u2019s view and\nmessage on valuation.\nLater on August 19, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed to representatives of Vista the Special Committee\u2019s view and message on\nvaluation. Representatives of Vista did not respond to the view and message on valuation delivered by Morgan Stanley on behalf of the Special\nCommittee and noted that they would need to continue to conduct diligence to determine if they were interested in pursuing an acquisition of KnowBe4.\nOn August 26, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Vista. Representatives of Vista reported that Vista was continuing to\nevaluate its investment in KnowBe4 and wished to proceed with further due diligence. Representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and Vista discussed,\nand were aligned, that if Vista decided to pursue an acquisition of KnowBe4, any such acquisition in which KKR and Elephant Funds were asked to roll\nsome or all of their equity in KnowBe4 would be subject to a non-waivable condition of approval by a \u201cmajority of the minority\u201d of KnowBe4\u2019s\nstockholders. No response by Vista to the Special Committee\u2019s pricing message was discussed during this meeting. Representatives of Vista noted that\nVista targeted September 9, 2022, as a date on which Vista would be able to provide further feedback to the Special Committee as to whether it was\ninterested in pursuing any type of transaction involving KnowBe4. Representatives of Vista conveyed that, if Vista were to determine to pursue an\nacquisition and make a proposal to acquire KnowBe4, it would want approximately three weeks between the decision to move forward with an acquisition\nand the execution of any definitive agreement, if an agreement could be reached, to conduct confirmatory due diligence and to engage with potential\nsources of financing.\nOn August 26, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley reported on Morgan Stanley\u2019s communications with Vista. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed that\nVista\u2019s proposed time period between the decision to move forward in pursuing an acquisition of KnowBe4 and the execution of any definitive agreement\ncould have significant benefits to KnowBe4, as any proposal submitted by Vista would be publicly filed as an amendment to Vista\u2019s existing Schedule\n13D and could be evaluated by any other potential acquirers. The Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed certain tactics that\nVista may employ in connection with submitting a proposal, and representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed an analysis of precedent Vista price\nnegotiations. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also provided an update on the other potential bidders for an acquisition of KnowBe4 and noted that\nno other potential bidder had expressed as much interest, or had been as active, as Vista.\nOn August 30, 2022, the Special Committee directed KnowBe4 management to provide Vista and its representatives with access to an electronic data room\nfor purposes of its continued evaluation of its investment in KnowBe4 and its continued evaluation of whether it would potentially be interested in\npursuing a potential acquisition of KnowBe4.\nOn September 2, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley (1) discussed Vista\u2019s due diligence progress and the due diligence progress by certain potential bidders for an\nacquisition of KnowBe4\u037e and (2) provided an update on the other potential bidders for an acquisition of KnowBe4, including that one bidder had recently\nheld an initial meeting with KnowBe4 management and another bidder had recently passed on pursuing an acquisition of KnowBe4 at this time. The\nSpecial Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley\n \n37\nTable of Contents\ndiscussed the anticipated timeline for the submission of an acquisition proposal by Vista and whether to expedite the work to be performed by the non-\nVista potential bidders in light of the fact that Vista had communicated that it would be able to provide feedback on September 9, 2022 as to whether it was\ninterested in pursuing a potential transaction. After discussion of the benefits and considerations, the Special Committee determined that it would\ncontinue to allow each potential bidder to proceed at its own pace.

The Proposal further reflected that Vista was open to certain of KnowBe4\u2019s significant stockholders rolling over a\nportion of their current investment and, to the extent applicable as a result of their doing so, Vista would expect the transaction to be expressly\nconditioned on the MFW framework.

Representatives of Vista indicated that it would be prepared to provide executed debt and equity commitment\nletters at the time of signing of any definitive agreement for an acquisition and that the Revised Proposal reflected Vista\u2019s expectation that certain of\nKnowBe4\u2019s significant stockholders would rollover an aggregate amount of $675 million in equity (valued at a price of $24.60 per share in cash).\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed to Vista that they believed that there was more work to do on the pricing for a transaction. Representatives\nof Vista later distributed a written copy of the Revised Proposal to Morgan Stanley, which also reiterated that Vista expected the transaction to be\nexpressly conditioned on the MFW framework, as previously described in the Proposal. Representatives of Vista also orally conveyed to the\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley a proposal on the termination and reverse termination fees for the transaction, including that KnowBe4\u2019s termination\nfee would be set at 3.5 percent of KnowBe4\u2019s equity value and Parent\u2019s reverse termination fee would be set at 5.5 percent of KnowBe4\u2019s equity value.\nOn September 29, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley reported on their meeting with Vista and the terms of the Revised Proposal, including that, in response to questions\nfrom Morgan Stanley, representatives of Vista did not say that this was Vista\u2019s best and final offer. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed a\npotential counterproposal to the Revised Proposal and potential messaging for such counterproposal. The Special Committee and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley also discussed the recent market\n \n41\nTable of Contents\nvolatility over the course of the Special Committee\u2019s evaluation of a potential acquisition and that the market trading of the peer set of comparable\ncompanies had declined. The Special Committee also considered the risks posed by this market volatility and decline in market trading for the peer set of\ncomparable companies when making its decision to deliver its counterproposal on price and related messaging to Vista. After discussion, the Special\nCommittee determined to submit a counterproposal to Vista that would have Vista acquire KnowBe4 for cash consideration of $25.75 per share, and a\nmessage encouraging a response from Vista on pricing that went as far into the $25.00s as Vista could go. The Special Committee also determined to\nsubmit a counterproposal, and authorized Morgan Stanley to do so, on the termination and reverse termination fees for the transaction, with the Special\nCommittee proposing that KnowBe4\u2019s termination fee be set at 3.5 percent of KnowBe4\u2019s equity value and Parent\u2019s reverse termination fee be set at 7\npercent of KnowBe4\u2019s equity value, representing a 2x difference between the two fees. The Special Committee also authorized representatives of Morgan\nStanley to discuss with Vista the concept of a retention bonus pool for members of KnowBe4 management, which would reward members of Company\nmanagement who had assisted the Special Committee and KnowBe4 with the Special Committee\u2019s process and incentivize such members of management\nof KnowBe4 to remain with KnowBe4 and assist with executing on any agreed-upon acquisition.

Representatives of Vista also conveyed that it (1) would not be in a position to submit a proposal at\na price of $25.00 per share or above\u037e and (2) agreed in principle with the construct of a retention bonus pool for members of KnowBe4 management. The\nrepresentatives of Vista conveyed that they had accepted the Special Committee\u2019s proposed 2x difference between KnowBe4\u2019s termination fee and\nParent\u2019s reverse termination fee but proposed, instead, that KnowB4\u2019s termination fee be set at 3 percent of KnowBe4\u2019s equity value and Parent\u2019s reverse\ntermination fee be set at 6 percent of KnowBe4\u2019s equity value. Representatives of Morgan Stanley asked whether this proposal represented Vista\u2019s best\nand final offer, and representatives of Vista indicated that they were reluctant to characterize the proposal as such but that Vista did not have the capacity\nto make a similar increase in pricing as illustrated by their latest response on pricing.\nFollowing the delivery of Vista\u2019s counterproposal, the Special Committee reconvened its earlier meeting from that day by video conference with\nrepresentatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.

The Special Committee and its advisors discussed a potential counterproposal to Vista and, after\ndiscussion, the Special Committee authorized representatives of Morgan Stanley to deliver a counterproposal to Vista at $24.90 per share in cash. The\nSpecial Committee also instructed that, assuming that an agreement on pricing could be reached, the Special Committee was supportive of releasing the\nchaperone restrictions, which would allow direct discussions among Vista, KKR, Elephant Funds, Mr. Sjouwerman and their respective representatives.\nFollowing the end of the Special Committee\u2019s meeting on September 29, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed the Special Committee\u2019s\ncounterproposal of $24.90 per share in cash to representatives of Vista. Vista accepted such counterproposal, reiterated its prior agreement on the\nconcept of a bonus retention pool for KnowBe4 management, and noted that $682 million would be the required amount for an equity rollover and/or co-\ninvestment of certain significant stockholders of KnowBe4. The representatives of Vista also proposed that KnowBe4 would reimburse Vista for fees and\nexpenses incurred in connection with the potential acquisition of KnowBe4 if the merger agreement was not approved by KnowBe4 stockholders.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed that the Special Committee had approved of the release of the chaperone restrictions in light of the Special\nCommittee and Vista reaching a preliminary agreement on pricing, which then allowed for direct discussions among Vista, KKR, Elephant Funds, Mr.\nSjouwerman and their respective representatives.\n \n42\nTable of Contents\nOn September 30, 2022, representatives of Kirkland delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of each of Potter Anderson and\nWilson Sonsini, along with initial drafts of the limited guarantee and equity commitment letter.

Given the contemplated rollover by certain significant stockholders, representatives of Kirkland\nproposed that the transaction, in addition to the majority of the minority voting standard and the required statutory stockholder voting standard, include\nseparate class votes of KnowBe4\u2019s Class A common stock and KnowBe4\u2019s Class B common stock. Representatives of Kirkland conveyed that Vista\nproposed that, prior to the record date for the KnowBe4 stockholder vote, (1) Vista would irrevocably \u201cdown-convert\u201d all of its shares of KnowBe4\u2019s\nClass B common stock into shares of KnowBe4\u2019s Class A common stock\u037e and (2) that Vista would request that each of the rollover stockholders also\ndown-convert shares of KnowBe4\u2019s Class B common stock that they would rollover in the transaction or a commensurate amount of shares equal to the\nvalue that such rollover stockholder expected to invest in KnowBe4 in connection with the transaction with Vista. The proposed down-converts by Vista,\nKKR, Mr. Sjouwerman and Elephant Funds would result in those holders having a higher percentage of the Class A common stock than they held before\nsuch time by irrevocably surrendering the superior voting rights associated with the shares of \u201cdown-converted\u201d Class B stock. Following such down-\nconverts, Vista, KKR, Mr. Sjouwerman and Elephant Funds would, in the aggregate, hold approximately 36 percent of the voting power of the outstanding\nshares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock. The proposed down-converts by KKR, Mr. Sjouwerman and Elephant Funds would have an immaterial impact\non their respective aggregate voting power but the down-convert by Vista would cause Vista\u2019s aggregate voting power to decrease from approximately\n14.9 percent of KnowBe4\u2019s voting power to approximately three percent.\nOn October 10, 2022, representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and Vista met to discuss certain outstanding transaction items, including certain\noutstanding economic points in the Merger Agreement related to the expense reimbursement provision and certain potential cost of living adjustments\nand Vista\u2019s views on such points.\nAlso on October 10, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Morgan Stanley\nand Wilson Sonsini.

Representatives of Potter Anderson reviewed the form of Special\nCommittee resolutions that had been previously circulated to the Special Committee, and, after discussion at the meeting, the Special Committee\nunanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the\nUnaffiliated Stockholders\u037e (2) recommended that the KnowBe4 Board approve the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the\nLimited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and determine that the Merger Agreement, the\nRollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger,\nare advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated Stockholders\u037e and (3) recommended that, subject to the approval of the\nKnowBe4 Board, the KnowBe4 Board submit the Merger Agreement to KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders for their adoption and approval and recommend that\nKnowBe4\u2019s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.\nFollowing the Special Committee meeting on October 11, 2022, the KnowBe4 Board held a special meeting by video conference with representatives of\neach of Wilson Sonsini, Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Watzinger provided an overview of the Special Committee\u2019s process and\nrecommendation to the KnowBe4 Board. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an overview of the transaction documents for the acquisition and\nthe material terms therein. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an overview of the Special Committee\u2019s outreach to financial sponsor and\nstrategic potential bidders and reviewed that Morgan Stanley had rendered an oral fairness opinion to the Special Committee. Representatives of Wilson\nSonsini also provided a review of the KnowBe4 Board\u2019s fiduciary duties and the MFW framework. After discussion at the meeting, the KnowBe4 Board\nunanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and its\nstockholders, including the Unaffiliated Stockholders\u037e (2) approved the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited\nGuarantees and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger\u037e and (3) recommended that KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders vote\nin favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.\nLater on October 11, 2022, following the meeting of the KnowBe4 Board, Vista and KnowBe4 signed the merger agreement and the other transaction\ndocuments. The Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements were also signed.\nOn October 12, 2022, KnowBe4 issued a press release announcing the transaction with Vista.\nOn December 15, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini and\nMorgan Stanley present. Representatives of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley updated the Special Committee on the transaction\nstatus. In addition, for the sake of completeness, representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed with the Special Committee that the Company\u2019s\npreliminary proxy statement filed on November 14, 2022 disclosed that Morgan Stanley had received aggregate fees of approximately $120 to $140 million\nin the two years prior to the date of its opinion for financial advisory\n \n45\nTable of Contents\nand financing services provided to the Vista Related Entities, which was approximately $80 million higher than such fees disclosed in the Morgan Stanley\nrelationships disclosure memorandum delivered to the Special Committee on July 12, 2022. Morgan Stanley explained that the difference was attributable\nto the fact that the July 12 relationships disclosure memorandum only reflects fees received with respect to entities that are majority-controlled affiliates\nor portfolio companies of Vista as of the date of disclosure as expressly set forth therein (and also did not include pending transactions), whereas the\nproxy statement includes fees that were received by Morgan Stanley from majority-controlled affiliates or portfolio companies of Vista during the two\nyears prior to the date of its fairness opinion, including affiliates or portfolio companies of Vista that were no longer majority-controlled affiliates or\nportfolio companies of Vista as of the date of disclosure. Following Morgan Stanley\u2019s departure from the meeting, the Special Committee, following\ndiscussion, confirmed that such fees did not change its view that Morgan Stanley was able to fulfill its responsibilities as an independent financial\nadvisor to the Special Committee.\nReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board",

            "text": "Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board\nRecommendation of the Special Committee\nIn evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement, including the Merger, the Special Committee consulted with its independent financial advisor, Morgan Stanley, and its\nindependent legal advisor, Potter Anderson, and, where appropriate, with members of KnowBe4 management and Wilson Sonsini, in its capacity as\nKnowBe4\u2019s outside legal advisor. The Special Committee unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support\nAgreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and\nin the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated Stockholders. In addition, the Special Committee believes that the Merger is fair to KnowBe4\u2019s\n\u201cunaffiliated security holders,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act (the \u201cunaffiliated security holders\u201d).\nThe Special Committee also unanimously recommended that the KnowBe4 Board:\n \n\u2022\napprove the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement, including the Merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\ndetermine that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the\nUnaffiliated Stockholders\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nsubject to approval by the KnowBe4 Board, submit the Merger Agreement to our stockholders for their adoption and approval and\nrecommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance with\nthe DGCL.\nIn the course of reaching its determination and making its recommendations, the Special Committee considered the following non-exhaustive list of\nmaterial factors, which are not presented in any relative order of importance and each of which the Special Committee viewed as being generally\nsupportive of its determination and recommendations to the KnowBe4 Board:\n \n\u2022\nPotential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Special Committee that none of the possible alternatives to the Merger (including\ncontinuing to operate KnowBe4 as an independent company or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived risks of\nthose alternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to our stockholders of those alternatives and the timing and likelihood of\neffecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for KnowBe4 to create greater value for our\nstockholders, taking into account execution risks as well as business, financial, industry, competitive and regulatory risks.\n \n\u2022\nOutcome of Strategic Pre-Signing Market Check. At the direction of the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley conducted a pre-signing\nmarket check by contacting thirteen (13) financial sponsors, including\n \n46Table of Contents\nVista and two (2) financial sponsors that owned strategic parties, and four (4) strategic parties to gauge their interest in a potential\nacquisition of KnowBe4. No party contacted, other than Vista, submitted a proposal or an indication of interest to acquire KnowBe4.\nFurther, the Special Committee considered that the time period between the announcement of Vista\u2019s public proposal and the execution of\ndefinitive agreement with Vista acted as a passive pre-signing market check. KnowBe4, the Special Committee and their respective advisors\ndid not receive any third-party proposals or indications of interests during this time period, despite public awareness of a proposal from\nVista.\n \n\u2022\nCertainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the Merger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty\nof value and immediate liquidity at an attractive price measured against the ongoing business and financial execution risks of KnowBe4\u2019s\nbusiness plan and its continued operations as an independent company and allows our stockholders to realize that value immediately upon\nthe consummation of the Merger. In that regard, the Special Committee noted that the amount of cash to be received for each outstanding\nshare of KnowBe4 common stock is fixed and will not be reduced if the share price of KnowBe4 common stock declines prior to the effective\ntime of the Merger.\n \n\u2022\nBest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Special Committee that the per share price represented Vista\u2019s best and final offer and\nthe best value that KnowBe4 could reasonably obtain from Vista for the shares of KnowBe4 common stock, taking into account (1) Vista\u2019s\nstatements and reputation\u037e (2) the Special Committee\u2019s assessment that other parties did not have the interest in, or capability to, acquire\nKnowBe4, including based on the regulatory, financing and other execution risks applicable to each party\u037e and (3) the Special Committee\u2019s\nfamiliarity with the business, operations, prospects, business strategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of KnowBe4 on a\nhistorical and prospective basis and its assessment of associated risks, including execution risks with respect to KnowBe4\u2019s business plan.\nIn forming this belief, the Special Committee also considered that (1) Vista was the only party out of 17 potential parties contacted to submit\na proposal\u037e (2) no other third party bidder submitted a proposal during this period to acquire KnowBe4, despite ample opportunity to do so\u037e\nand (3) the Special Committee received feedback from certain potential third party bidders for a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 that such\nbidders could not see themselves paying a meaningful premium to the current market price of KnowBe4. The Special Committee believed\nthat, after negotiations at the direction of the Special Committee and with the assistance of experienced independent legal and financial\nadvisors, the Special Committee obtained the best terms and highest price that Vista was willing to pay for KnowBe4, pursuant to a\nthorough process and that further negotiations would have created a risk of causing Vista to abandon the Merger altogether or materially\ndelay the entry into definitive transaction agreements with respect to the Merger. In addition, the Special Committee believed that, measured\nagainst the longer-term execution risks described above, the per share price reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of KnowBe4\ncommon stock. The Special Committee also considered that the per share price constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 44 percent to the\nclosing price of KnowBe4 common stock of $17.30 per share on September 16, 2022, which was the last full trading day before Vista publicly\ndisclosed its initial non-binding acquisition proposal\u037e and (2) a premium of approximately 30 percent to KnowBe4\u2019s 30-day trading average\nclosing stock price of KnowBe4 Class A common stock of $19.10 per share ending on September 16, 2022.\n \n\u2022\nFinancial Condition, Results of Operations and Prospects of KnowBe4\u037e Risks of Execution. The current, historical and projected financial\ncondition, results of operations and business of KnowBe4, as well as KnowBe4\u2019s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent\ncompany. In particular, the Special Committee considered KnowBe4\u2019s then-current business plan, including management\u2019s then-current\nestimated projections of KnowBe4\u2019s financial prospects, as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. As part of this, the\nSpecial Committee considered KnowBe4\u2019s current business plan and the potential opportunities and risks that it presented against, among\nother things, various execution, operational and other risks to achieving the business plan and related uncertainties, including: (1) the\nimpact of market, customer and competitive trends on KnowBe4\u037e\n \n47\nTable of Contents\n(2) the likelihood that the business plan could be achieved in the face of operational and execution risks, including loss of market share,\ncustomer dissatisfaction or employee attrition\u037e and (3) general risks related to market conditions that could negatively impact our valuation\nor reduce the price of KnowBe4 common stock. In particular, the Special Committee considered the likelihood and timing of, and risks to,\nachieving the operational improvements, objectives and market share capture assumptions underlying the business plan, as well as the\nestimated projections of KnowBe4\u2019s financial prospects, all as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\n \n\u25cb\nAmong the potential risks identified by the Special Committee were: KnowBe4\u2019s competitive positioning and prospects as an\nindependent company. Included among these risks were consideration of (1) KnowBe4\u2019s size, as well as its financial resources,\nrelative to those of its competitors\u037e (2) new and evolving competitive threats\u037e (3) changes in the industry in which KnowBe4\noperates\u037e (4) the substantial risks to achieving KnowBe4\u2019s business plan\u037e and (5) the ultimate size of the total available market for\nKnowBe4\u2019s business.\n \n\u25cb\nThe Special Committee also considered the challenges of a public company in making investments, operational changes, and\nimprovements (including meaningful cost reductions) to achieve long-term growth and profitability. The Special Committee was aware\nthat such investments, changes and improvements could lead to disruption in our performance and expose us to scrutiny based on\nour quarter-over-quarter operational and financial metrics and results. The Special Committee was also aware that the price of\nKnowBe4 common stock could be negatively impacted if we failed to meet investor expectations, including if we failed to meet our\ngrowth and profitability objectives.\n \n\u2022\nOpinion of Morgan Stanley. The oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Special Committee, subsequently confirmed by delivery of\nits written opinion, dated October 11, 2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various matters, limitations,\nqualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Price to be received by the holders of KnowBe4 common stock (other than\nthe holders of the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Stockholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders of KnowBe4 common stock. The opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\u201d and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B to\nthis proxy statement.\n \n\u2022\nNegotiations with Parent and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the Merger Agreement, which was the product of arm\u2019s-length\nnegotiations, and the belief of the Special Committee that the Merger Agreement contained terms and conditions that provided the Special\nCommittee with a high level of closing certainty. The factors considered included:\n \n\u25cb\nKnowBe4\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties submitting\nunsolicited takeover proposals.\n \n\u25cb\nThe Special Committee\u2019s belief that the terms of the Merger Agreement would be unlikely to deter third parties from making a superior\nproposal.\n \n\u25cb\nThe ability of the KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, and the Special Committee\u2019s ability, in\neach case under certain circumstances, to change, withdraw or modify the recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement.\n \n\u25cb\nThe KnowBe4 Board\u2019s ability, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, under certain circumstances, to terminate\nthe Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal. In that regard, the Special Committee\nbelieved that the termination fee payable by KnowBe4 in such instance was reasonable, consistent with or below similar fees payable\nin comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.\n \n48\nTable of Contents\n\u25cb\nThe limited conditions to Parent\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger, making the Merger reasonably likely to be consummated.\n \n\u25cb\nThe reverse termination fee of $276 million payable by Parent in certain circumstances, our ability to specifically enforce Parent\u2019s\nobligations under the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and to cause the equity financing to be funded if the conditions\nto closing are satisfied and the debt financing is available, and the other remedies available to KnowBe4 under the Merger\nAgreement, including monetary damages. The Special Committee also considered the terms of the Limited Guarantees, which\nguarantee payment of the reverse termination fee.\n \n\u25cb\nThe Special Committee also considered the terms of the (1) the Debt Commitment Letter, which commits the debt sources to lend a\nportion of the amounts needed by Parent to fund the transaction\u037e and (2) the Equity Commitment Letters, which commit the\nGuarantors and the KKR Investor to invest the balance of the amounts needed by Parent to fund the transaction (including\nKnowBe4\u2019s third-party beneficiary rights to enforce the Guarantors\u2019 and the KKR Investor\u2019s equity commitments under the Equity\nCommitment Letters in accordance with their terms and the terms of the Merger Agreement).\n \n\u25cb\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement provide KnowBe4 with sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary\ncourse until the earlier of the consummation of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement.\n \n\u2022\nReasonable Likelihood of Consummation. The belief of the Special Committee that an acquisition by Parent has a reasonable likelihood of\nclosing, including that there were no anticipated substantive issues expected in connection with the required regulatory approvals. In that\nregard, the Special Committee considered Vista\u2019s business reputation and financial resources, as well as those of Parent\u2019s debt financing\nsources, all of which the Special Committee believed increased the likelihood that the required debt and equity financing for the Merger\nwould be available.\n \n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders have the right to exercise their statutory appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and\nreceive payment of the fair value of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock in lieu of the Per Share Price, subject to and in accordance with\nthe terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the DGCL, unless and until any such KnowBe4 stockholder fails to perfect or\neffectively withdraws or loses such holder\u2019s rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL.\n \n\u2022\nCurrent and Historical Market Prices. The current and historical market prices of KnowBe4\u2019s Class A common stock, including as set forth\nin the table under \u201cImportant Information Regarding KnowBe4\u2014Market Price of KnowBe4 Class A Common Stock\u201d and \u201cSpecial\nFactors\u2014Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\u201d taking into account the market performance of KnowBe4\u2019s Class A common stock\nrelative to the capital stock of other participants in the industries in which KnowBe4 operates and general market indices.\nThe Special Committee also considered a number of factors relating to the procedural safeguards that it believes were and are present to ensure the\nfairness of the Merger and to permit the Special Committee to represent effectively the interests of the Unaffiliated Stockholders and the unaffiliated\nsecurity holders of KnowBe4. In the light of such procedural safeguards, the Special Committee did not consider it necessary to retain an unaffiliated\nrepresentative to act solely on behalf of the Unaffiliated Stockholders and the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 for purposes of negotiating the\nterms of the Merger Agreement or preparing a report concerning the fairness of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. The Special Committee believes\nthese factors support its determinations and recommendations and provide assurance of the procedural fairness of the Merger to the Unaffiliated\nStockholders and the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4:\n \n\u2022\nIndependence. The Special Committee, since its formation, has consisted solely of independent (for purposes of serving on the Special\nCommittee) and disinterested directors that are not affiliated with, and are independent of, any of the potential counterparties to a potential\nacquisition of KnowBe4\n \n49\nTable of Contents\n(including a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 that has a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders\nof KnowBe4 have an interest that is in addition to, and/or different from, the interests of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders as a whole) and were\notherwise disinterested and independent with respect to a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (including a potential acquisition of KnowBe4\nthat has a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders of KnowBe4 have an interest that is in\naddition to, and/or different from, the interests of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders as a whole), other than as discussed in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Interests of KnowBe4\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d\u037e\n \n\u2022\nNegotiating Authority. The authority granted to the Special Committee by the KnowBe4 Board to, among other things, (1) review, evaluate\nand negotiate the structure, form, terms and conditions of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (including a potential acquisition of KnowBe4\nthat has a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders of KnowBe4 have an interest that is in addition\nto, and/or different from, the interests of the KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders as a whole) and the form, terms and conditions of any definitive\nagreements or documents in connection therewith, (2) to determine not to proceed with any such process, procedures, review or evaluation,\nand (3) to consider and evaluate any alternative transactions.\n \n\u2022\nActive Involvement and Oversight. The numerous meetings held by the Special Committee to discuss and evaluate, among other things, the\nSpecial Committee\u2019s pre-signing market check and the proposals from Vista, and the Special Committee\u2019s active oversight of the negotiation\nprocess. The Special Committee was actively engaged in this process on a regular basis and was provided with full access to KnowBe4\nmanagement and its advisors in connection with the evaluation process.\n \n\u2022\nIndependent Advice. The Special Committee selected and engaged its own independent legal and financial advisors and received the advice\nof such advisors throughout its review, evaluation and negotiation of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4.\n \n\u2022\nFull Knowledge. The Special Committee made its evaluation of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista based upon the factors\ndiscussed in this proxy statement and with the full knowledge of the interests of the Rollover Stockholders.\n \n\u2022\nNo Obligation to Recommend. The recognition by the Special Committee that it had no obligation to recommend to the KnowBe4 Board the\napproval of the Merger or any other transaction and had the authority to reject any proposals made.\n \n\u2022\nPrior Special Committee Action. The KnowBe4 Board was not permitted to approve any potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (including a\npotential acquisition of KnowBe4 that also included a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders of\nKnowBe4 had an interest that was in addition to, and/or different from, the interests of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders as a whole) or recommend\nfor approval any such transactions by KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders without a prior favorable recommendation of the transaction by the Special\nCommittee.\n \n\u2022\nCommunication Safeguards. The Special Committee requested that the Rollover Stockholders and their representatives not engage in\ndirect, unchaperoned discussions with Vista and its representatives on the Rollover until after the Special Committee and the\nrepresentatives of Vista had reached a preliminary agreement on pricing for the transaction and the Special Committee expressly authorized\nthe Rollover Stockholders to have such discussions. The Rollover Stockholders and their representatives abided by the Special\nCommittee\u2019s request and did not have direct, unchaperoned discussions with Vista and its representatives until such events occurred.\n \n\u2022\nAdditional Procedural Safeguards. The KnowBe4 Board, in its authorizing resolutions for the Special Committee, determined that KnowBe4\nwould not effectuate an acquisition of KnowBe4 that included a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant\nstockholders of KnowBe4 had an interest that is in addition to, and/or different from, the interests of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders as a whole,\nunless it had been (1) approved or recommended by the Special Committee and (2) approved by\n \n50\nTable of Contents\nholders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company held by disinterested stockholders (as determined by\nthe Special Committee).\n \n\u2022\nMajority of the Minority Approval. The consummation of the Merger requires the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote, which requires the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock (voting together as a\nsingle class) held by the Unaffiliated Stockholders and entitled to vote on the Merger Agreement.\nIn the course of reaching its determinations and making its recommendations, the Special Committee also considered the following non-exhaustive list of\ncountervailing factors concerning the Merger Agreement and the Merger, which are not presented in any relative order of importance:\n \n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the Merger as a cash transaction means that our stockholders\n(other than the Rollover Stockholders) will not participate in KnowBe4\u2019s future earnings or growth and will not benefit from any\nappreciation in value of the surviving corporation. The Special Committee considered the other potential alternative strategies available to\nKnowBe4 as an independent company, which, despite significant uncertainty, had the potential to result in a more successful and valuable\ncompany.\n \n\u2022\nNo-Shop Restrictions. The restrictions in the Merger Agreement on KnowBe4\u2019s ability to solicit competing transactions (subject to certain\nexceptions to allow the KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, or the Special Committee, to exercise\ntheir respective fiduciary duties and, in the case of KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, to accept a\nsuperior proposal, and then only upon the payment of a termination fee). The Special Committee was also aware that Vista\u2019s indirect\nownership interest in KnowBe4 (through the VEPF Funds) and the interests of the Rollover Stockholders in the Merger would likely be\nconsidered by third parties evaluating whether to make superior proposals.\n \n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the Merger might not be consummated, and if it is not\nconsummated, that: (1) KnowBe4\u2019s directors, management team and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will\nhave experienced significant distractions from their work on behalf of KnowBe4 during the pendency of the Merger\u037e (2) KnowBe4 will have\nincurred significant transaction and other costs\u037e (3) KnowBe4\u2019s continuing business relationships with customers, business partners and\nemployees may be adversely affected\u037e (4) the trading price of KnowBe4 Class A common stock could be adversely affected\u037e (5) the\ncontractual and legal remedies available to KnowBe4 in the event of the breach or termination of the Merger Agreement may be insufficient,\ncostly to pursue, or both\u037e (6) the reverse termination fee of $276 million payable by Parent to KnowBe4 will not be available in all instances\nin which the Merger Agreement is terminated and such reverse termination fee may not be sufficient to compensate KnowBe4 for the\ndamage suffered by its business as a result of the pendency of the Merger or of the strategic initiatives forgone by KnowBe4 during this\nperiod\u037e and (7) the failure of the Merger to be consummated could result in an adverse perception among our customers, potential\ncustomers, employees and investors about KnowBe4\u2019s prospects.\n \n\u2022\nRegulatory Risks. The possibility that regulatory agencies may delay, object to, challenge or seek to enjoin the Merger, or may seek to\nimpose terms and conditions on their approvals that are not acceptable to Parent, notwithstanding its obligations under the Merger\nAgreement.\n \n\u2022\nImpact of Interim Restrictions on KnowBe4\u2019s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger. The restrictions on the conduct of\nKnowBe4\u2019s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking strategic initiatives before\nthe completion of the Merger that, absent the Merger Agreement, we might have pursued, or from taking certain actions aimed at\nincentivizing and retaining our employees.\n \n51\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nEffects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the Merger, including the: (1) effects on our employees,\ncustomers, operating results and stock price\u037e (2) impact on our ability to attract and retain key management, sales and marketing, and\ntechnical personnel\u037e and (3) potential for litigation in connection with the Merger.\n \n\u2022\nTermination Fee Payable by KnowBe4. The requirement that KnowBe4 pay Parent a termination fee of $138 million under certain\ncircumstances following termination of the Merger Agreement, including if KnowBe4 terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a superior\nproposal. The Special Committee considered the potentially discouraging impact that this termination fee could have on a third party\u2019s\ninterest in making a competing proposal to acquire KnowBe4.\n \n\u2022\nTaxable Consideration. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of KnowBe4 common stock in the Merger will be a taxable transaction\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes for many of our stockholders.\n \n\u2022\nInterests of KnowBe4\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers. The interests that KnowBe4\u2019s directors and executive officers may have in the\nMerger, which may be different from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders.\n \n\u2022\nInterests of Certain Significant Stockholders in the Merger. Certain significant stockholders of the KnowBe4 common stock were offered\nthe opportunity, and elected, to participate in an equity rollover or equity reinvestment in Vista\u2019s potential acquisition of KnowBe4, which\nsuch option to participate was not extended to all of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders. As noted in this section, these significant stockholders will\nbe able to participate in the future growth or earnings of the post-closing company with respect to that portion of their equity that they are\nrolling over or reinvesting in the post-closing entity. However, those stockholders elected to forgo the certain value of the Per Share Price\nfor such rollover shares, which value the Special Committee found compelling for KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders.\n \n\u2022\nVoting Obligations of Certain Significant Stockholders. Certain significant stockholders of KnowBe4 are parties to Rollover Stockholder\nSupport Agreements with KnowBe4 and Parent, which, under certain circumstances, obligate such holders to vote in favor of the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement and that those obligations do not automatically terminate in the event that the KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the\nrecommendation of the Special Committee, or the Special Committee modifies, changes or withdraws KnowBe4\u2019s recommendation with\nrespect to the transaction.\n \n\u2022\nConversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock. Certain significant stockholders of KnowBe4 are parties to Rollover\nStockholder Support Agreements with KnowBe4 and Parent or KnowBe4 only, which obligated such holders to convert certain amounts of\nshares of KnowBe4 Class B common stock to KnowBe4 Class A common stock prior to the Record Date.\nRecommendation of the KnowBe4 Board\nBased on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee and on the basis of the other factors described above, the KnowBe4 Board\nunanimously:\n \n\u2022\ndetermined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and our\nstockholders, including the Unaffiliated Stockholders (and, accordingly, the \u201cunaffiliated security holders,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule\n13e-3 under the Exchange Act)\u037e\n \n\u2022\napproved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\ndirected that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of our stockholders at a meeting of our stockholders\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nrecommended that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance\nwith the DGCL.\n \n52\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the KnowBe4 Board, on behalf of KnowBe4, believes, based on the factors described below, that the Merger is fair to the \u201cunaffiliated\nsecurity holders,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act.\nThe KnowBe4 Board did not assess whether the \u201crollover\u201d provisions of the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements with the Rollover Stockholders\nare advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Rollover Stockholders.\nIn the course of reaching its determination and making its recommendations, the KnowBe4 Board considered the following non-exhaustive list of material\nfactors and countervailing factors, which are not presented in any relative order of importance:\n \n\u2022\nDeterminations of the Special Committee. The Special Committee\u2019s analysis (as to both substantive and procedural aspects of the Merger),\nconclusions and unanimous determination, which the KnowBe4 Board adopted, that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder\nSupport Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are\nadvisable, fair to and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated Stockholders (and, as described in this proxy statement, the\n\u201cunaffiliated security holders,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act). The KnowBe4 Board also considered the Special\nCommittee\u2019s unanimous recommendation that the KnowBe4 Board approve the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support\nAgreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger and, subject to\nKnowBe4 Board approval, that the Board submit the Merger Agreement to the stockholders of KnowBe4 for their adoption and approval\nand recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance\nwith the DGCL.\n \n\u2022\nProcedural Protections. The procedural fairness of the Merger, including that (1) it was negotiated by the Special Committee consisting\nsolely of independent (for purposes of serving on the Special Committee) and disinterested directors that are not affiliated with, and are\nindependent of, any of the potential counterparties to a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (including a potential acquisition of KnowBe4\nthat has a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders of KnowBe4 have an interest that is in addition\nto, and/or different from, the interests of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders as a whole) and were otherwise disinterested and independent with\nrespect to a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (including a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 that has a transaction or series of transactions\nin which one or more significant stockholders of KnowBe4 have an interest that is in addition to, and/or different from, the interests of\nKnowBe4\u2019s stockholders as a whole), other than as discussed in the section titled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Interests of KnowBe4\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger\u201d\u037e and (3) the Special Committee had the authority to select and engage, and was advised by, its own\nindependent legal and financial advisors\u037e\n \n\u2022\nUnaffiliated Stockholder Vote. Although consummation of the Merger does not specifically require that the Merger Agreement be adopted\nby KnowBe4\u2019s unaffiliated security holders, the Merger Agreement provides that consummation of the Merger is conditioned upon\nKnowBe4 obtaining the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote. Messrs. Daly, Sjouwerman and Shanley (the \u201cAffiliated Directors\u201d) are not deemed\nto be Unaffiliated Stockholders due to their affiliations with the Rollover Stockholders\u037e accordingly, the shares they beneficially own will be\nexcluded from the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote. The directors other than the Affiliated Directors (the \u201cUnaffiliated Directors\u201d) are deemed\nto be Unaffiliated Stockholders\u037e accordingly, the shares they beneficially own will be counted toward the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote.\nWhile the Unaffiliated Directors are deemed to be \u201caffiliates\u201d of KnowBe4 under Rule 13e-3 and thus are not deemed to be \u201cunaffiliated\nsecurity holders,\u201d for purposes of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee viewed the\nUnaffiliated Stockholder Vote as a procedural safeguard of the interests of the unaffiliated security holders because they considered the\ninterests of the Unaffiliated Directors to be entirely aligned with those of the unaffiliated security holders. Specifically, following the Merger,\nthe Unaffiliated Directors will not retain any equity interest in KnowBe4, they will receive the same Per Share Price as the\n \n53\nTable of Contents\nunaffiliated security holders upon consummation of the Merger, and the Unaffiliated Directors have not received any consideration beyond\nthe Per Share Price from any Purchaser Filing Party in connection with the Merger or entered into any agreement, arrangement or\nunderstanding to receive any consideration from any Purchaser Filing Party in connection with the Merger. Further, as of the Record Date,\nMr. Venkataraman was the only Unaffiliated Director who held shares of KnowBe4 common stock, and his holdings represented less than\none percent of KnowBe4\u2019s outstanding capital stock and less than one percent of the voting power of KnowBe4\u2019s capital stock.\nAccordingly, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee considered the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote as a factor in support of their\nbelief that the Merger is fair to KnowBe4\u2019s unaffiliated security holders.\n \n\u2022\nOther Factors Considered by the Special Committee. The other material factors and countervailing factors considered by the Special\nCommittee and listed above.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Special Committee and by the KnowBe4 Board is not intended to be\nexhaustive and includes only the material factors considered. In the light of the variety of factors considered by the Special Committee and by the\nKnowBe4 Board and the complexity of these factors, neither the Special Committee nor the KnowBe4 Board found it practicable to, and did not, quantify\nor otherwise assign relative weights, ranks or values to the foregoing factors in reaching their respective determinations and recommendations.\nMoreover, each member of the Special Committee and of the KnowBe4 Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may\nhave assigned different relative weights, ranks or values to the different factors, and the recommendations, determinations and approvals, where\napplicable, by the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board were based upon the totality of the information presented to, and considered by, the\nSpecial Committee and the KnowBe4 Board, respectively.\nIn the course of evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and making the decisions, determinations and recommendations described above (as\napplicable), the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee did not consider the liquidation value of KnowBe4 because (1) they considered KnowBe4 to\nbe a viable, going concern\u037e (2) they believed that liquidation sales generally result in proceeds substantially less than sales of going concern\u037e and (3)\nthey considered determining a liquidation value to be impracticable given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup of KnowBe4. For the\nforegoing reasons, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee did not consider liquidation value to be a relevant factor. Further, the KnowBe4 Board\nand the Special Committee did not consider KnowBe4\u2019s net book value, which is an accounting concept, as a factor because they believe (1) that net\nbook value is not a material indicator of the value of KnowBe4 as a going concern but rather is indicative of historical costs and (2) net book value does\nnot take into account the prospects of KnowBe4, market conditions, trends in the industry in which KnowBe4 operates or the business risks inherent in\nthe industry. In addition, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee did not view the purchase prices paid in the transactions described in the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201cImportant Information Regarding KnowBe4\u2014Transactions in KnowBe4 Common Stock\u201d (all of which were\nbelow the Per Share Price) to be relevant except to the extent that those prices indicated the trading price of the KnowBe4 Class A common stock during\nthe applicable periods. The KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee believe that the trading price of the shares of KnowBe4 common stock at any\ngiven time represents the best available indicator of KnowBe4\u2019s going concern value at that time so long as the trading price at that time is not impacted\nby speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction. In addition, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee implicitly considered the\nvalue of KnowBe4 as a going concern by taking into account the value of KnowBe4\u2019s current and anticipated business, financial condition, results of\noperations, prospects, and other forward-looking matters.\nOther than as described in this proxy statement, the KnowBe4 Board is not aware of any firm offer by any other person during the prior two years for (1) a\nmerger or consolidation of KnowBe4 with another company\u037e (2) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of KnowBe4\u2019s assets\u037e or (3) a purchase of\nKnowBe4\u2019s securities that would enable such person to exercise control of KnowBe4.\n \n54\nTable of Contents\nOpinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nThe Special Committee retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with the possible sale\nof KnowBe4. The Special Committee selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on, among other things, Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nindependence, its prior experience advising KnowBe4, and its qualifications, experience and expertise, including with respect to serving as a financial\nadvisor to technology, cybersecurity and software companies, advising companies on M&A transactions and serving as an independent financial\nadvisor to special committees of boards of directors.

With\nrespect to the Projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments of KnowBe4\u2019s management of the future financial performance of KnowBe4. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to such Projections or\nthe assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set\nforth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions (the effect of which would be material to Morgan\nStanley\u2019s analysis or its opinion), including among other things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Debt\nCommitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letters, and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft\nthereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other\napprovals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material\nadverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor.\nMorgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of KnowBe4 and its legal, tax or regulatory\nadvisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any\nother alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley\nexpressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of KnowBe4\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or\nany class of such persons, relative to the Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the holders of\nthe Excluded Shares and the Rollover Stockholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses\ndescribed represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these\n \n56\nTable of Contents\nsummaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan\nStanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial\nanalyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses and the factors\nconsidered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and was directed by the Special Committee\nto rely upon, among other matters, (1) the Projections and (2) certain estimates of equity research analysts (the \u201cStreet Consensus\u201d). The Projections are\nmore fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d In accordance with\ndirection from the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley utilized the Street Consensus and the Projections in its financial analyses described below.\nPublic Trading Comparables Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar\ncompanies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for KnowBe4 with comparable publicly available\nconsensus equity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, that share similar\nbusiness characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue\ngrowth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (the \u201ccomparable companies\u201d).\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed (1) the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue and (2) the ratio of price to estimated free\ncash flow, which, in each case, for purposes of this analysis, (a) for KnowBe4, (i) was provided to Morgan Stanley, and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nuse, by KnowBe4 management for calendar year 2023 and for the Projections, and (ii) was based on available consensus equity analyst research\nestimates for calendar year 2023 and for the Street Consensus\u037e and (b) for each of the comparable companies, was based on publicly available consensus\nequity analyst research estimates for comparison purposes. For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined \u201caggregate value\u201d as a company\u2019s\nfully diluted equity value plus total debt, less cash and cash equivalents and defined \u201cfree cash flow\u201d as operating cash flow, less capital expenditures.\nFor calendar year 2023, the range of observed multiples of the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue for comparable high growth software\ncompanies was 3.7x to 14.4x, with a median observed multiple of 6.3x. For calendar year 2023, the range of observed multiples of the ratio of aggregate\nvalue to estimated revenue for comparable high growth security companies was 3.8x to 14.6x, with a median observed multiple of 6.9x.

Morgan Stanley then applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated\nrelevant revenue or free cash flow metric for KnowBe4, as applicable. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized publicly available financial\ninformation, available as of October 7, 2022.\nBased on the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock on a fully diluted basis and latest cash and debt balance as provided by KnowBe4\nmanagement, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of KnowBe4 common stock as follows:\n \nPublic Trading Comparables\nSelected\nComparable\nCompany AV/\nCY23\nEstimated\nRevenue\nMultiple Ranges\nImplied Value\nPer\nShare of\nKnowBe4\nCommon\nStock ($)\nCY 2023E Revenue\nStreet Consensus\n6.0x \u2013 9.0x\n15.36 \u2013 22.05\nProjections\n6.0x \u2013 9.0x\n16.15 \u2013 23.24\n \n58\nTable of Contents\nPublic Trading Comparables\nSelected\nComparable\nCompany P/ CY23\nEstimated FCF\nMultiple Ranges\nImplied Value Per\nShare of\nKnowBe4\nCommon\nStock ($)\nCY 2023E Free Cash Flow\nStreet Consensus\n30.0x \u2013 45.0x\n16.93 \u2013 25.33\nProjections\n30.0x \u2013 45.0x\n17.43 \u2013 26.07\nNo company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to KnowBe4. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made\nnumerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,\nmany of which are beyond KnowBe4\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on KnowBe4\u2019s business and the industry\ngenerally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of KnowBe4 and the industry, and in\nthe financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using\ncomparable company data.\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity value of a company\nas a function of such company\u2019s estimated future revenue. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied\npresent value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per share of the KnowBe4 common\nstock on a standalone basis for each of the Street Consensus and Projections.\nTo calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized calendar year 2025 revenue estimates under each of the Street\nConsensus and Projections, respectively. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley applied a forward\nrange of aggregate value to estimated revenue multiples and price to estimated free cash flow multiples (based on such multiples for the comparable\ncompanies) to these revenue and free cash flow estimates, respectively, in order to reach a future-implied fully diluted aggregate value and equity value,\nrespectively. For each of the Street Consensus and Projections, Morgan Stanley applied an aggregate value to estimated revenue multiple range of 6.0x to\n9.0x. For the Street Consensus, Morgan Stanley applied a price to estimated free cash flow multiple range of 30.0x to 45.0x and for the Projections, Morgan\nStanley applied a price to estimated free cash flow multiple range of 30.0x to 40.0x, each to generate an undiscounted, implied future fully diluted equity\nvalue.\nIn each case, Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied future fully diluted equity value to October 7, 2022, at a discount rate of 12.7 percent,\nwhich rate was selected by Morgan Stanley based on KnowBe4\u2019s estimated cost of equity, estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and\nutilizing a 6 percent market risk premium, a risk-free rate of 3.8 percent based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of October 7, 2022, and a 1.49 predicted\nbeta per Barra.

Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for the\nKnowBe4 common stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value KnowBe4 as a standalone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the\nProjections for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization (burdened by stock-based compensation), less taxes and capital expenditures, and adjusted for changes in net working\ncapital. The Projections, for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, included extrapolations through calendar year 2032 prepared by Morgan\nStanley with the guidance of KnowBe4 management (which extrapolations were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by KnowBe4\nmanagement). The free cash flows and terminal values were discounted to present values as of October 7, 2022, at a discount rate ranging from 11.7\npercent to 13.7 percent, which discount rates were selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an\nestimate of KnowBe4\u2019s weighted average cost of capital estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and utilizing a 6 percent market risk\npremium, a risk-free rate of 3.8 percent based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of October 7, 2022, and a 1.49 predicted beta per Barra. To calculate\nterminal values, Morgan Stanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 3.0 percent to 4.0 percent as part of its analyses, with such rates selected upon the\napplication of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. The resulting aggregate value was then adjusted for net debt.\nBased on the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by KnowBe4\u2019s management, Morgan Stanley calculated\nthe estimated implied value per share of KnowBe4 common stock as follows:\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nImplied, Discounted\nValue\nPer Share of\nKnowBe4\nCommon Stock ($)\nProjections\n16.94 \u2013 22.60\nPrecedent Transactions Multiples Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly available\nfinancial terms. Morgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for selected software transactions. Morgan Stanley selected such comparable\ntransactions based on its professional judgment and experience, including because they shared certain characteristics with the Merger, most notably\nbecause they were similar software transactions since 2014. For such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the multiple of aggregate value of the\ntransaction to the estimated next 12 months\u2019 (\u201cNTM\u201d) revenue based on publicly available information at the time of announcement or at the unaffected\ndate of each such transaction.\nThe following is a list of the selected software transactions reviewed, together with the applicable multiples:\n \nSelected Software Transactions (Target/Acquiror)\nAV/NTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nStrategic Acquirors\nAdaptive Insights Inc. / Workday, Inc.\n11.0x\nAppDynamics, Inc. / Cisco Systems, Inc.\n13.7x\nAuth0, Inc. / Okta, Inc.\n35.0+x\nAVG Technologies USA, Inc. / Avast Plc\n3.3x\nBroadsoft, Inc. / Cisco Systems, Inc.\n4.8x\nCallidus Software Inc. / SAP America, Inc.\n8.3x\nCarbon Black, Inc. / VMware, Inc.\n8.0x\nConcur Technologies, Inc. / SAP America, Inc.\n10.3x\n \n60\nTable of Contents\nSelected Software Transactions (Target/Acquiror)\nAV/NTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nFigma, Inc / Adobe Inc.\n28.0+x\nFive9, Inc. / Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\n25.7x\nFleetmatics Group PLC / Verizon Communications Inc.\n6.6x\nLivongo Health, Inc. / Teladoc Health, Inc.\n44.9x\nMulesoft, Inc. / Salesforce.com, Inc.\n15.7x\nNetSuite Inc. / Oracle Corporation\n9.1x\nNortonLifeLock Inc. / Symantec Enterprise Cloud\n3.2x\nQualtrics International Inc. / SAP America, Inc.\n16.5x\nSendGrid, Inc. / Twilio Inc.\n15.7x\nSlack Technologies, Inc. / Salesforce.com, Inc.\n24.9x\nTableau Software Inc. / Salesforce.com, Inc.\n11.0x\nFinancial Sponsor Acquirors\nAnaplan, Inc. / Thoma Bravo, L.P.\n13.6x\nApptio Inc. / Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n7.0x\nAvalara, Inc. / Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n9.0x\nBarracuda Networks, Inc. / Thoma Bravo, LLC\n3.8x\nCambium Learning Group, Inc. / Veritas Capital Fund Management, L.L.C.\n4.2x\nCloudera, Inc. / Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC\u037e Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.

The following table summarizes the results of Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis:\n \nPrecedent Transaction Multiples\n(Revenue NTM CY22E)\nSelected\nTransactions\nAV/ NTM Revenue\nMultiple Ranges\nImplied Value\nPer\nShare of\nKnowBe4\nCommon Stock\n($)\nStreet Consensus\n7.0x \u2013 11.0x\n16.82 \u2013 25.31\nProjections\n7.0x \u2013 11.0x\n17.53 \u2013 26.42\nNo company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to KnowBe4 or the Merger. In evaluating the precedent\ntransactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and\nfinancial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond KnowBe4\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on\nKnowBe4\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and\nprospects of KnowBe4 and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the\naggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present\nvalue per share of KnowBe4 derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the $24.90 per share in cash to be\nreceived by holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Stockholders) is not\nnecessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis of the consideration for the Merger but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley\nconsidered.\nOther Information\nMorgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analysis with respect to its opinion but were\nnoted as reference data for the Special Committee, including the following information described under the sections of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014\nIllustrative Precedent Premiums,\u201d \u201c\u2014Historical Trading Ranges\u201d and \u201c\u2014Equity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets.\u201d\nIllustrative Precedent Premiums\nMorgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent transactions premiums analysis by reviewing software company transactions larger than $1 billion in\naggregate value since 2014. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the distributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (1) the\nimplied premium to KnowBe4\u2019s closing Class A common stock price on September 16, 2022, the last trading day prior to announcement of KnowBe4\u2019s\nreceipt of an offer from Vista to acquire KnowBe4\u037e and (2) the implied premium to KnowBe4\u2019s unaffected 30-day average closing Class A common stock\nprice on September 16, 2022.\nBased on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley\nselected (1) a representative range of premia and applied such range to KnowBe4\u2019s closing Class A common stock price on September 16, 2022, and (2) a\nrepresentative range of premia and applied such range to KnowBe4\u2019s unaffected 30-day average closing Class A common stock price on September 16,\n2022:\n \nPrecedent Transaction Premia\nRepresentative\nRanges\nImplied Value per\nShare of KnowBe4\nCommon Stock ($)\nPremia to Unaffected Spot\n20% \u2013 50%\n20.76 \u2013 25.95\nPremia to Unaffected 30-Day Average\n20% \u2013 50%\n22.92 \u2013 28.65\n \n62\nTable of Contents\nHistorical Trading Ranges\nMorgan Stanley noted certain trading ranges with respect to the historical stock prices of the KnowBe4 Class A common stock. Morgan Stanley reviewed\na range of prices of the KnowBe4 Class A common stock for various periods ending on September 16, 2022. Morgan Stanley observed the following:\n \nHistorical Trading Ranges\nRange of Trading\nPrices\nPer Share of\nKnowBe4 Class A\nCommon Stock ($)\nLast 30 days ending on September 16, 2022\n17.30 \u2013 20.28\nLast 90 days ending on September 16, 2022\n14.29 \u2013 20.80\nLast 365 days ending on September 16, 2022\n14.29 \u2013 27.40\nEquity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets\nMorgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for the KnowBe4 Class A common stock prepared and published by equity\nresearch analysts prior to September 16, 2022. These targets reflected each analyst\u2019s estimate of the future public market trading price of the KnowBe4\nClass A common stock. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for the KnowBe4 Class A common stock was $19.00 to $28.00 per share as of\nSeptember 16, 2022. Morgan Stanley then discounted the range of analyst price targets per share for the KnowBe4 Class A common stock by one year at\na rate of 12.7 percent, which was the discount rate selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, to\nreflect KnowBe4\u2019s cost of equity, estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and utilizing a 6 percent market risk premium, a risk-free rate of\n3.8 percent based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of October 7, 2022, and a 1.49 predicted beta per Barra. This analysis indicated an implied range of\nfully diluted equity values for the KnowBe4 Class A common stock of $16.85 to $24.84 per share.\nThe public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the KnowBe4\nClass A common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of KnowBe4 and future financial\nmarket conditions.\nPreliminary Presentations by Morgan Stanley\nIn addition to its October 11, 2022 opinion and October 10, 2022 presentation to the Special Committee and the underlying financial analyses performed in\nrelation thereto, Morgan Stanley also delivered preliminary presentation materials to the Special Committee on July 28, 2022, August 19, 2022, September\n15, 2022 and September 29, 2022 (the \u201cPreliminary Presentation Materials\u201d). The preliminary financial considerations and other information in the\nPreliminary Presentation Materials were based on information and data that was available as of the date of such respective presentation. The Preliminary\nPresentation Materials substantively reflected the analyses described above under \u201c\u2014Summary of Financial Analyses.\u201d Copies of such Preliminary\nPresentation Materials have been filed as exhibits to the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger, will be made available for\ninspection and copying at the principal executive offices of KnowBe4 during its regular business hours by any interested holder of KnowBe4 common\nstock, and may be obtained by requesting it in writing from KnowBe4 at the address described in the section titled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional\nInformation.\u201d\nThe Preliminary Presentation Materials were for discussion purposes only and did not present any findings or make any recommendations or constitute\nan opinion of Morgan Stanley with respect to the fairness of the Merger Consideration or otherwise. The financial analyses performed by Morgan\nStanley in relation to its opinion dated October 11, 2022, as described above under \u201c\u2014Summary of Financial Analyses,\u201d superseded all analyses and\ninformation presented in the Preliminary Presentation Materials.\n \n63\nTable of Contents\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the Merger by the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for\npurposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or\nsummary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular\nweight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a\nwhole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various\nanalyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other\nassumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nview of the actual value of KnowBe4. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,\ngeneral business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond KnowBe4\u2019s control. These include,\namong other things, the impact of competition on KnowBe4\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse\nmaterial change in the financial condition and prospects of KnowBe4 and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those\nsuggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Price\nto be received by the holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Stockholders) in the\nMerger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of October 11, 2022 to the Special Committee.\nThese analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of KnowBe4 common stock might actually trade.\nThe Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares and the Rollover\nStockholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Special Committee and Vista\nand was recommended by the Special Committee and approved by the KnowBe4 Board. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Special Committee during\nthese negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to KnowBe4 or the Special Committee, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that\nany specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of\nthe Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are\navailable. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders\nshould vote at the Special Meeting.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Special Committee was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Special Committee to\nrecommend that the KnowBe4 Board approve, and the KnowBe4 Board to approve, the Merger Agreement. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a\ncommittee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley\u2019s customary practice.\nMorgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its\nsecurities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime\nbrokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at\nany time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and\neffect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Vista Related Entities, the KKR\nRelated Entities, Elephant Partners, Parent, KnowBe4 and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any\n \n64\nTable of Contents\ncurrency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors or\nofficers, including individuals working with the Special Committee in connection with the Merger, may have committed and may commit in the future to\ninvest in private equity funds managed by the Vista Related Entities, the KKR Related Entities, and Elephant Partners or in affiliates of Morgan Stanley\nthat may hold direct equity and/or partnership interests in private equity funds managed by Vista, the Vista Related Entities, KKR or the KKR Related\nEntities.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Special Committee with financial advisory services and an opinion, described in\nthis section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the Merger, and KnowBe4 has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley an\naggregate fee of approximately $51 million, approximately $10 million of which was earned following delivery of the opinion described in this section and\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. KnowBe4 has also agreed\nto reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional\nadvisors, actually incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, KnowBe4 has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and\ntheir respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain\nlosses, claims, damages or liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement.\nIn the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financing services for KnowBe4 and\nreceived aggregate fees of approximately $5 to $10 million in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion, Morgan Stanley provided financial advisory and financing services to the Vista Related Entities and received aggregate fees of approximately\n$120 to $140 million in connection with such services (this includes fees attributable to a transaction that closed on September 30, 2022 and financial\nadvisory and financing services fees from companies that were no longer majority-controlled affiliates or portfolio companies of Vista at the time the\nrelationships disclosure memorandum was circulated by Morgan Stanley on July 12, 2022). In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion,\nMorgan Stanley provided financial advisory and financing services to the KKR Related Entities and received aggregate fees of approximately $80 to $105\nmillion in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, Morgan Stanley has not provided financial\nadvisory and financing services to Elephant Partners. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and/or financing services to KnowBe4,\nParent, Vista, the Vista Related Entities, KKR, the KKR Related Entities and Elephant Partners in the future and would expect to receive fees for the\nrendering of these services.\nPosition of the Purchaser Filing Parties as to the Fairness of the Merger\nUnder the SEC rules governing \u201cgoing-private\u201d transactions, each Purchaser Filing Party may be deemed to be an affiliate of KnowBe4 and, therefore,\nrequired to express its belief as to the fairness of the proposed Merger to KnowBe4\u2019s \u201cunaffiliated security holders,\u201d as defined under Rule 13e-3 of the\nExchange Act. The Merger is a Rule 13e-3 transaction for which a Schedule 13e-3 Transaction Statement has been filed with the SEC. The Purchaser Filing\nParties are making the statements included in this section solely for purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules and\nregulations under the Exchange Act. However, the view of the Purchaser Filing Parties as to the fairness of the Merger should not be construed as a\nrecommendation to any KnowBe4 stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote on the Merger Proposal. The Purchaser Filing Parties have\ninterests in the Merger that are different from, and in addition to, the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4.\nThe Purchaser Filing Parties did not participate in the deliberation of the Special Committee regarding, nor receive advice from the respective legal or\nother advisors of the Special Committee as to, the fairness of the Merger. The Purchaser Filing Parties have not performed, or engaged a financial advisor\nto perform, any valuation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the Merger to the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4.\nBased on, among other things, the factors considered by, and the analysis and resulting\n \n65\nTable of Contents\nconclusions of, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Reasons for\nthe Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board\u201d (which analysis and resulting conclusions the Purchaser Filing Parties\nadopt), the Purchaser Filings Parties believe that the Merger is substantively fair to the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4. In particular, the\nPurchaser Filing Parties considered the following:\n \n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of the KnowBe4 common stock, including the market performance of KnowBe4 Class A common\nstock relative to those of other participants in KnowBe4\u2019s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Per Share Price\nrepresents a premium of approximately 44 percent to the unaffected closing price of KnowBe4\u2019s Class A common stock on September 16,\n2022, the last full trading day before the filing of the Schedule 13D/A by Vista Filing Parties which disclosed Vista\u2019s initial non-binding\nacquisition proposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, KnowBe4 and KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders\n(including the Unaffiliated Stockholders and, accordingly, KnowBe4\u2019s unaffiliated security holders, as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the\nExchange Act)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Per Share Price shall be paid in all cash, thus allowing the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 to immediately realize a\ncertain and fair value for their shares, which value represents a significant premium to the closing price of the KnowBe4 common stock on\nthe last full trading day before the filing of the Schedule 13D/A by Vista Filing Parties which disclosed Vista\u2019s initial non-binding acquisition\nproposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger will provide liquidity for the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 without the delays that would otherwise be\nnecessary in order to liquidate the positions of larger holders, and without incurring brokerage and other costs typically associated with\nmarket sales\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger is not conditioned on any financing being obtained by Parent, increasing the likelihood that the Merger will be\nconsummated and that the consideration to be paid to the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 in the Merger will be received\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe potential risks to KnowBe4 of continuing to have publicly traded common stock, including the risks of market volatility and global\neconomic uncertainty.\n \n\u2022\nThe Purchaser Filing Parties further believe that the Merger is procedurally fair to the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 based upon,\namong other things, the following factors:\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the KnowBe4 Board was fully informed about the extent to which the interests of the Purchaser Filing Parties in the Merger\ndiffered from those of the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the KnowBe4 Board formed the Special Committee consisting solely of non-management independent members of the\nKnowBe4 Board not affiliated with the Purchaser Filing Parties at the outset of discussions of a potential transaction between KnowBe4 on\nthe one hand and Vista on the other\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that since the outset of discussion of the potential transaction, Vista has, to the extent that such transaction involved a rollover by\nStu Sjouwerman, the Elephant Funds and/or the KKR Investors, conditioned the potential transaction upon the approval of the Special\nCommittee and the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the voting power held by the\noutstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock (voting together as a single class) held by the Unaffiliated Stockholders and entitled to vote\non the Merger Agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Special Committee retained, and had the benefit of advice from, nationally recognized legal and financial advisors\u037e\n \n66\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger consideration was the result of the Special Committee\u2019s extensive arm\u2019s-length negotiations with Parent\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Special Committee had the authority to reject any proposals made by Parent or any other person\u037e\n \n\u2022\nnotwithstanding the fact that the Morgan Stanley opinion was not delivered to the Purchaser Filing Parties and the Purchaser Filing Parties\nare not entitled to rely on such opinion, the fact that the KnowBe4 Board received a written opinion from Morgan Stanley on October 11,\n2022, stating that as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and\nqualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in preparing its opinion, the Per Share Price was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to the holders of KnowBe4 common stock\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the closing of the Merger is conditioned on KnowBe4\u2019s receipt of the requisite KnowBe4 stockholder approvals, including the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of\nKnowBe4 common stock (voting together as a single class) held by the Unaffiliated Stockholders and entitled to vote on the Merger\nAgreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nKnowBe4\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to provide information to, or participate in discussions\nor negotiations with, third parties regarding acquisition proposals that constitute, or are reasonably likely to lead to, superior proposals\u037e\n \n\u2022\nKnowBe4\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a\ndefinitive agreement related to a superior proposal, subject to paying Parent a termination fee of $138 million in cash, subject to and in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe availability of appraisal rights to KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders who comply with all of the required procedures under Delaware law for\nexercising appraisal rights, which allow such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares.\nThe Purchaser Filing Parties also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the substantive and procedural fairness of the\nproposed Merger, including:\n \n\u2022\n(1) the fact that the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 will not participate in any future earnings, appreciation in value or growth of\nKnowBe4\u2019s business and will not benefit from any potential sale of KnowBe4 or its assets to a third party in the future, (2) the risk that the\nMerger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all, and (3) the fact that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed corporations with\nessentially no assets other than (a) the funding commitments of the VEPF Funds and KKR Investor, (b) the rollover commitments of the\nPurchaser Filing Parties, and (c) the funding commitments of the debt financing sources\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of KnowBe4\u2019s business prior to the completion of the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement, which may\ndelay or prevent KnowBe4 from undertaking business opportunities that may arise and certain other actions it might otherwise take with\nrespect to the operations of KnowBe4 pending completion of the Merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe negative effect that the pendency of the Merger, or a failure to complete the Merger,

The Purchaser Filing Parties did not find it\npracticable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their conclusion as to the fairness of the\nMerger. Rather, the Purchaser Filing Parties reached their position as to the fairness of the Merger after considering all of the foregoing as a whole. The\nPurchaser Filing Parties believe these factors provide a reasonable basis upon which to form their position regarding the fairness of the Merger to the\nunaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4. This position should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any KnowBe4 stockholder to\napprove the Merger Agreement. The Purchaser Filing Parties make no recommendation as to how stockholders of KnowBe4 should vote their shares\nrelating to the Merger. The Purchaser Filing Parties attempted to negotiate the terms of a transaction that would be most favorable to them, and not to the\nunaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4, and, accordingly, did not negotiate the Merger Agreement with a goal of obtaining terms that were fair to the\nunaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4.\nBased on the Purchaser Filing Parties\u2019 knowledge and analysis of available information regarding KnowBe4, the Special Committee and the KnowBe4\nBoard, as well as discussions with members of KnowBe4\u2019s senior management regarding KnowBe4 and its business and the factors considered by, and\nfindings of, the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board and discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Reasons for\nthe Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board\u037e Fairness of the Merger,\u201d the Purchaser Filing Parties believe that the\nMerger is fair to the unaffiliated security holders.\nPlans for KnowBe4 After the Merger",

The shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock are currently listed on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act.\nFollowing completion of the Merger, there will be no further market for the shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock and, as promptly as practicable\nfollowing the effective time of the Merger and in compliance with applicable law, the KnowBe4 Class A common stock securities will be delisted from the\nNasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nAt the effective time of the Merger, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will become the initial directors of the\nsurviving corporation, and the officers of KnowBe4 immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will become the officers of the surviving\ncorporation, in each case until their successor is duly elected and qualified or until the earlier of his or her death, resignation or removal in accordance\nwith the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation. At the effective time of the Merger, KnowBe4\u2019s certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws will be amended and restated to be in the form of (except with respect to the name of the entity) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of\nMerger Sub and, as so amended, will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of KnowBe4 following the Merger until thereafter amended in\naccordance with their respective terms and Delaware law.\nThe Purchaser Filing Parties currently anticipate that KnowBe4\u2019s operations initially will be conducted following completion of the Merger substantially\nas they are currently being conducted (except that KnowBe4 will cease to be a public company and will instead be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent).\nThe Purchaser Filing Parties are currently conducting a review of KnowBe4 and its business and operations with a view towards determining how\n \n68Table of Contents\nto redirect KnowBe4\u2019s operations to improve KnowBe4\u2019s long-term earnings potential as a private company (including by reducing KnowBe4\u2019s costs and\nexpenses following the Merger) and expect to complete such review following completion of the Merger. Further, following completion of the Merger, the\nPurchaser Filing Parties will continue to assess KnowBe4\u2019s assets, corporate and capital structure, capitalization, operations, business, properties and\npersonnel to determine what additional changes, if any, would be desirable following the Merger to enhance the business and operations of KnowBe4.

As a result of the Merger, KnowBe4 will cease to be a publicly traded company, KnowBe4 Class A\ncommon stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act and KnowBe4 will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If\nthe Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.\nThe effective time of the Merger will occur upon the filing of a Certificate of Merger with, and acceptance of that certificate by, the Secretary of State of\nthe State of Delaware (or at a later time as KnowBe4, Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in such Certificate of Merger).\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger:\n \n\u2022\nthe Excluded Shares will be canceled and cease to exist without any

Incentive Plan and 2021 Equity Incentive Plan will be terminated, and\nno further awards will be granted under such plans.\nAt or prior to the closing of the date of the Merger, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated paying agent to pay the aggregate Per\nShare Price. Once a stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her or its stock certificates (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of a stock certificate)\nor customary agent\u2019s message with respect to book-entry shares, appropriate letter of transmittal and other items specified by the payment agent, then\nthe payment agent will pay the stockholder the appropriate portion of the aggregate Per Share Price. For more information, see the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures.\u201d\nFollowing the Merger, all of the equity interests in the surviving corporation will be owned by Parent. If the Merger is completed, Parent (and the Rollover\nStockholders indirectly through their equity interests in Parent) will be the sole beneficiaries of KnowBe4\u2019s future earnings and growth, if any, and will be\nentitled to vote on corporate matters affecting KnowBe4 following the Merger. Similarly, Parent (and the Rollover Stockholders indirectly) will also bear\nthe risks of ongoing operations, including the risks of any decrease in KnowBe4\u2019s value after the merger.\nIn connection with the Merger, certain members of KnowBe4\u2019s management will receive benefits and be subject to obligations that are different from, or in\naddition to, the benefits and obligations of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders generally, as described in more detail under \u201c\u2014Interests of KnowBe4\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger.\u201d Those incremental benefits are expected to include, among other benefits, certain executive officers continuing as\nexecutive officers of the surviving corporation.\n \n70\nTable of Contents\nBenefits of the Merger for the Unaffiliated Security Holders\nThe primary benefit of the Merger to the \u201cunaffiliated security holders,\u201d as defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act, will be their right to receive the Per\nShare Price for each share of KnowBe4 common stock held by such stockholders as described above. This amount constitutes a premium of\napproximately 44 percent to the unaffected closing price of KnowBe4 Class A common stock of $17.30 per share on September 16, 2022, the last full\ntrading day before Vista publicly disclosed its initial non-binding acquisition proposal. Additionally, such stockholders will avoid the risk after the\nMerger of any possible decrease in KnowBe4\u2019s future earnings, growth or value.\nDetriments of the Merger to the Unaffiliated Security Holders\nThe primary detriment of the Merger to the \u201cunaffiliated security holders,\u201d as defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act, is the lack of an interest of such\nstockholders in the potential future earnings, growth, or value realized by KnowBe4 after the Merger. In addition, the unaffiliated security holders will not\nbenefit from any sale of KnowBe4 or its assets to a third party in the future. Additionally, the receipt of cash in exchange for KnowBe4 common stock\npursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable sale transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders who surrender their KnowBe4\ncommon stock in the Merger to the extent that such stockholders have any gain on their shares of KnowBe4 common stock.\nCertain Effects of the Merger for the Purchaser Filing Parties\nIf the Merger is completed, all of the equity interests in KnowBe4 will be beneficially owned, indirectly through Parent, by the Purchaser Filing Parties and\ntheir affiliates.\nThe benefits of the Merger to the Purchaser Filing Parties include the fact that, following the completion of the Merger, Parent will directly own 100\npercent of the outstanding equity interests of the surviving company and will therefore have a corresponding 100 percent interest in the surviving\ncompany\u2019s net book value and net earnings. The table below sets forth the beneficial ownership of KnowBe4 common stock and resulting interests in\nKnowBe4\u2019s net book value and net earnings of the Purchaser Filing Parties prior to and immediately after the Merger, based on KnowBe4\u2019s net book\nvalue at September 30, 2022 and net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as if the Merger were completed on such date.\n \nBeneficial Ownership of KnowBe4 Prior to the\nMerger(1)\nBeneficial Ownership of KnowBe4\nAfter the Merger(2)\n($ in thousands)\n%\nOwnership\nNet Book\nValue at\nSeptember\n30,\n2022(3)\nNet\nIncome for\nthe Nine\nMonths\nEnded\nSeptember\n30,\n2022\n%\nOwnership\nNet Book\nValue at\nSeptember\n30,\n2022(3)\nNet\nIncome for\nthe\nNine\nMonths\nEnded\nSeptember\n30, 2022\nParent\n\u2014\n$\n\u2014\n$\n\u2014\n100%\n$\n247,185\n$\n11,223\nVEPF Funds\n9.3%\n23,006\n1,048\n76.9%\n190,085\n8,630\nKKR Investor\n14.8%\n36,562\n1,665\n8.9%\n21,999\n999\nElephant Funds\n21.1%\n51,898\n2,363\n12.6%\n31,145\n1,414\nFounder\n2.6%\n6,301\n287\n1.6%\n3,955\n180\n \n(1)\nBased on 85,601,803 shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock and 90,452,534 shares of KnowBe4 Class B common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2022.\n(2)\nThe actual interests of the Purchaser Filing Parties following completion of the Merger will be based on the Rollover Stockholders\u2019 ownership of KnowBe4 common\nstock as of the date of completion. In addition, the post-closing interest of the VEPF Funds and the KKR Investor will be reduced to the extent the VEPF Funds or the\nKKR Investor, as applicable, assign a portion of the equity financing commitment to other parties.\n(3)\nBased on total stockholders\u2019 equity of $247.2 million as of September 30, 2022.\n \n71\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the Purchaser Filing Parties will benefit from the savings associated with KnowBe4 no longer being required to file reports under or otherwise\nhaving to comply with provisions of the Exchange Act. Detriments of the Merger to the Purchaser Filing Parties include the lack of liquidity for KnowBe4\ncommon stock following the Merger and the risk that KnowBe4 will decrease in value following the Merger.\nCertain Effects on KnowBe4 if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the requisite votes of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,\nKnowBe4\u2019s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of KnowBe4 common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, (1) KnowBe4\nwill remain an independent public company\u037e (2) KnowBe4 common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the\nExchange Act\u037e and (3) KnowBe4 will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, KnowBe4 expects that: (x)\nour management will continue to operate the business as it is currently being operated\u037e and (y) KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders will continue to be subject to the\nsame risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which KnowBe4 operates\nand adverse economic conditions.\nFurthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that cause the Merger not to be completed, the price of KnowBe4\ncommon stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of KnowBe4 Class A common stock would return to\nthe price at which the KnowBe4 Class A common stock trades as of the date of this proxy statement. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the\neffect of the Merger not being completed on the future value of your shares of KnowBe4 common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the KnowBe4\nBoard will continue to evaluate and review, among other things, KnowBe4\u2019s business, operations, strategic direction and capitalization, and will make\nwhatever changes it deems appropriate. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the requisite votes of KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders or if the Merger is not\ncompleted for any other reason, KnowBe4\u2019s business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, in specified circumstances in which the Merger Agreement is terminated, KnowBe4 has agreed (1) to pay Parent a termination fee of $138\nmillion or (2) to reimburse Parent for its reasonable and documented third party transaction expenses up to $15 million, depending on the circumstances of\nthe termination, as more fully described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination of the Merger Agreement\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination\nFees and Remedies.\u201d",

            "text": "Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nOther than in connection with our regular earnings press releases and related investor materials, we do not, as a matter of course, make public projections\nas to our long-term future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying\nassumptions and estimates. However, KnowBe4 management regularly prepares projections as to our future financial performance for internal use.\nIn connection with our strategic planning process and evaluation of strategic alternatives (including continuing as an independent company), KnowBe4\nmanagement prepared and reviewed with the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board the Management Plan (which included unaudited forward-\nlooking financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2025) as part of KnowBe4 management\u2019s business plan, including the Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information set forth below. At the direction of the Special Committee, cash flows for 2026 through 2032 were extrapolated by Morgan Stanley\nand approved by the KnowBe4 management for use by Morgan Stanley in connection with its financial analyses for the purpose of rendering an opinion\nto the Special Committee. This forward-looking information is collectively referred to as the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, as described in\nmore detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.\u201d \n \n72Table of Contents\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and was provided to the Special\nCommittee and the KnowBe4 Board for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the Merger and strategic alternatives thereto. At the\ndirection of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was also provided to, and approved for use\nby, Morgan Stanley for purposes of performing its financial analyses in connection with rendering its opinion to the Special Committee (as more fully\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\u201d). With KnowBe4\u2019s consent, Morgan Stanley\nassumed that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was reasonably prepared and reflected the best currently available estimates and\njudgments as to KnowBe4\u2019s future financial performance. In addition, a subset of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was provided to Vista\nprior to the execution of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed by KnowBe4 management as then-current estimates of our future financial performance\nas an independent company, without giving effect to the Merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the Merger Agreement or the\nMerger, the expenses that have already and will be incurred in connection with completing the Merger, or any changes to KnowBe4\u2019s operations or\nstrategy that may be implemented in connection with the pendency of, or following the consummation of, the Merger. The Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the Merger to be completed\u037e it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in\nthat context.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with GAAP. In addition, the\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines\nestablished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information included in this document has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, KnowBe4\u2019s management. Neither KPMG\nLLP nor any other independent accountants have audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information and, accordingly, they do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The\nKPMG LLP report incorporated by reference relates solely to KnowBe4\u2019s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information and should not be read to do so.\nAlthough the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates as to\nfuture events, including those detailed above, made by KnowBe4 management that KnowBe4 management believed in good faith were reasonable.\nKnowBe4\u2019s ability to achieve the financial results contemplated by the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be affected by our ability to\nachieve our strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods, and will be subject to operational and execution risks associated\ntherewith. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important\nfactors that may affect actual results and cause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information not to be achieved include, among others, (1) general\neconomic conditions\u037e (2) our ability to achieve operating objectives with respect to expenses and operating margins, as well the risks to our ability to\ngrow revenues resulting from the execution of those objectives\u037e (3) our ability to achieve the various monetization, market share and other assumptions\nunderlying the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u037e (4) changes in laws, regulations and taxes relevant to KnowBe4\u2019s business\u037e (5) competitive\npressures in the cybersecurity industry, including new products and market entrants and changes in the competitive environment\u037e (6) customer demand\nfor our products and services\u037e (7) our ability to attract, integrate and retain qualified personnel\u037e and (8) uncertainty in the timing of relevant transactions\nand resulting cash inflows and outflows. Additional factors that may impact us or our business can be found in the various risk factors included in our\nperiodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of our control. As a result, there can be no\nassurance that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained\nin the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information may differ from publicized analyst estimates and\nforecasts. You should evaluate the Unaudited Prospective Financial\n \n73\nTable of Contents\nInformation, if at all, in conjunction with our historical financial statements and other information regarding KnowBe4 contained in our public filings with\nthe SEC. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information may not be consistent with KnowBe4\u2019s historical operating data as a result of the assumptions\ndetailed above. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such information was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future\nevents.\nBecause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to sensitivities and assumptions, as well as\nto multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also covers multiple\nyears, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not,\nand should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not fact and\nshould not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our future results or for purposes of making any investment decision.\nCertain of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information are non-GAAP financial measures, which are financial\nperformance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for\nGAAP financial measures and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are\nlimitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation.\nAccordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business\ncombination transaction, such as the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, are excluded from the definition of \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d\nunder applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not subject to SEC rules regarding\ndisclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial\nmeasure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Special Committee, the KnowBe4 Board, Morgan\nStanley or Vista. Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is provided in this\nproxy statement.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements.

For information on factors that may cause our\nfuture results to materially vary, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d Further, the inclusion of the Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by KnowBe4 that the information presented\nis material. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is included in this proxy statement solely to give our stockholders access to the information\nthat was made available to the Special Committee, the KnowBe4 Board, Morgan Stanley and Vista. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is\nnot included in this proxy statement in order to influence any KnowBe4 stockholder as to how to vote at the special meeting with respect to the Merger,\nor whether to seek appraisal rights with respect to their shares.\n \n74\nTable of Contents\nIn preparing the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, KnowBe4 management utilized the following material assumptions:\n \n\u2022\nRevenue growth rates ranging from 31 percent to 26 percent were applied to years 2023 through 2025 and reflect KnowBe4\u2019s expectations of\nfuture growth in consideration of historical experience. These growth rates assume renewals of existing customer contracts consistent with\nKnowBe4\u2019s historical logo retention which is in the high 90 percent range. Additionally, the growth rates reflect expectations of growth\nwithin international markets and additional cross selling of KnowBe4\u2019s existing and future products.\n \n\u2022\nEBITDA growth is consistent with the expectation of realizing future efficiencies as the business continues to scale and ranges from an\nEBITDA margin of 15 percent in 2022 up to 31 percent in 2025. This growth is reflective of (1) KnowBe4\u2019s expectations of efficiencies across\nthe sales organization as management automates certain aspects of the sales process\u037e (2) reductions in general and administrative costs as\nthe historical investments in KnowBe4\u2019s support functions are realized at scale\u037e and (3) future realization of KnowBe4\u2019s current market\nevangelism and product marketing efforts.\n \n\u2022\nCapital expenditures are higher in 2022 and 2023 to support management\u2019s current international expansion plans. A normalized level of\nspend is reflected for 2024 and 2025.\n \n\u2022\nStock-based compensation expense ranges from 8 percent to 9 percent of revenues for years 2022 through 2024 and reflects a consistent\napplication of management\u2019s existing equity incentive plan.\n \n\u2022\nUnlevered free cash flow is anticipated to improve from 12 percent in 2022 to 19 percent in 2025, with the exception of a reduction in 2023\nprimarily driven by anticipated expenses related to international expansion. These increases are the result of revenue growth in excess of 25\npercent for each of these years combined with reductions in our overall cost structure.\n \n\u2022\nNo material acquisitions or divestitures by KnowBe4 are anticipated.\nThe following table summarizes the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\n \n(dollars in millions)\nCalendar year ended December 31\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\n2028E\n2029E\n2030E\n2031E\n2032E\nTerminal\nYear\nNet Revenue\n$ 336\n$ 440\n$ 555\n$ 697\n$ 854\n$1,020\n$1,186\n$1,344\n$1,480\n$1,585\n$1,649\n$ 1,706\nEBITDA(1)\n$ 49\n$ 75\n$ 132\n$ 213\n$ 282\n$ 360\n$ 447\n$ 537\n$ 612\n$ 676\n$ 725\n$\n751\nDepreciation and amortization\n$ 14\n$ 16\n$ 21\n$ 25\n$ 26\n$\n31\n$\n36\n$\n40\n$\n44\n$\n48\n$\n49\n$\n51\nCapital expenditures and capitalized content\n$ (21) $ (25) $ (18) $ (20) $ (26) $\n(31) $\n(36) $\n(40) $\n(44) $\n(48) $\n(49) $\n(51)\nStock-based compensation(2)\n$ (26) $ (39) $ (42) $ (42) $ (43) $\n(51) $\n(59) $\n(67) $\n(74) $\n(79) $\n(82) $\n(85)\nTaxes\n$\n(1) $\n(5) $ (25) $ (44) $ (53) $\n(70) $\n(88) $ (107) $ (123) $ (137) $ (148) $ (154)\nChange in net working capital\n$ 64\n$ 65\n$ 69\n$ 63\n$ 78\n$\n83\n$\n83\n$\n79\n$\n68\n$\n52\n$\n32\n$\n29\nUnlevered free cash flow (Burdened by SBC)(3)\n$ 66\n$ 71\n$ 116\n$ 171\n$ 238\n$ 292\n$ 347\n$ 401\n$ 438\n$ 465\n$ 447\n$\n490\nStock-based compensation(2)\n$ 26\n$ 39\n$ 42\n$ 42\n$ 43\n$\n51\n$\n59\n$\n67\n$\n74\n$\n79\n$\n82\n$\n85\nUnlevered free cash flow (Unburdened by SBC)(4)\n$ 92\n$ 109\n$ 158\n$ 213\n$ 281\n$ 343\n$ 406\n$ 468\n$ 512\n$ 544\n$ 559\n$\n575\n \n(1)\nEBITDA is defined as KnowBe4\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets unburdened by stock-based compensation expense.\n(2)\nStock-based compensation is treated as a cash expense, and as such is deducted prior to calculating taxable income.

Such awards are subject to our Outside Director Compensation Policy, which provide for accelerated vesting upon a \u201cchange in\ncontrol.\u201d The closing of the Merger will be a \u201cchange in control\u201d within the meaning of our Outside Director Compensation Policy.\nIn February 2022, KnowBe4 granted a KnowBe4 RSU Award under its 2021 Equity Incentive Plan that is outstanding and held by Mr. Venkataraman. Such\naward was granted in connection with Mr. Venkataraman\u2019s transition to a non-employee director and is subject to the same accelerated vesting upon a\n\u201cchange in control\u201d as awards granted under our Outside Director Compensation Policy.\nEmployment Agreements with Current Executive Officers\nIn February 2020, KnowBe4 entered into agreements with each of Mr. Sjouwerman and Mr. Letonoff (collectively, the \u201cEO Agreements\u201d), which provide\nthat if Mr. Sjouwerman or Mr. Letonoff, as applicable, is terminated by KnowBe4 without \u201ccause\u201d or by him for \u201cgood reason,\u201d (an \u201cinvoluntary\ntermination\u201d) he will be entitled to following severance benefits, payable in cash, less applicable withholdings, in the form of equal payroll installment\npayments:\n \n\u2022\n12 months of base salary (as in effect at the time of termination of employment)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nany earned but unpaid annual bonus\u037e\n \n\u2022\na prorated portion of the target bonus amount\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe aggregate payments made by KnowBe4 towards the executive\u2019s medical and dental benefits during the 365-day period immediately prior\nto his termination of employment.\nThe severance benefits are conditioned on Mr. Sjouwerman or Mr. Letonoff, as applicable, executing and not revoking a general release of claims in favor\nof KnowBe4 and the executive\u2019s continued compliance with certain\n \n80\nTable of Contents\nrestrictive covenants, including perpetual confidentiality and non-disparagement covenants as well as non-compete and non-solicit obligations\napplicable for a period of 24 months following the date of his respective termination of employment. If any of the payments or benefits provided for under\nan agreement with Mr. Sjouwerman or Mr. Letonoff, as applicable, or otherwise payable to him would constitute \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 280G of the Code and could be subject to the related excise tax, he will receive either full payment of such payments and benefits or\nsuch lesser amount that would result in no portion of the payments and benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the greater amount\nof after-tax benefits to him. KnowBe4 is not required to provide any tax gross-up payments to Mr. Sjouwerman or Mr. Letonoff.\nEquity Award Agreements with Current and Former Executive Officers\nKnowBe4 has granted certain KnowBe4 RSU Awards under our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan that are outstanding and held by KnowBe4\u2019s current and\nformer executive officers. Such awards provide that, if (1) KnowBe4 incurs a \u201cchange in control\u201d and (2) during the period on and in the 12 months\nfollowing the change in control, (a) the executive officer\u2019s employment is terminated by KnowBe4 (or its successor) without \u201ccause\u201d or (b) the executive\nofficer resigns from employment with KnowBe4 (or its successor) for \u201cgood reason\u201d, then, in each case, 100 percent of the KnowBe4 RSU Award will\naccelerate and vest, subject to the executive officer executing a release of claims in favor of KnowBe4 (or its successor). The KnowBe4 RSU Awards\ngranted to Mr. Venkataraman in connection with his employment include this provision.\nAdditionally, we have granted certain KnowBe4 PSU Awards under our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan that are outstanding and held by our executive\nofficers. Such awards provide that if a \u201cchange in control\u201d occurs during the \u201cperformance period,\u201d then 100 percent of the KnowBe4 PSU Awards will\nbecome \u201celigible RSUs\u201d assuming achievement at the target level and will be subject to time-based vesting only. Such eligible RSUs would be subject to\nthe same \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d acceleration described above with respect to KnowBe4 RSU Awards.\nRetention Bonuses\nOn December 2, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the KnowBe4 Board awarded Lars Letonoff, KnowBe4\u2019s Co-President and Chief Revenue Officer,\nand Robert Reich, KnowBe4\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, cash retention bonuses, each in the amount of $1,375,000 (the \u201cRetention Bonuses\u201d). 50 percent of\neach Retention Bonus will vest and become payable upon the closing of the Merger, and 50 percent of each Retention Bonus will vest and become\npayable 90 days following the closing of the Merger, subject to certain conditions, including, but not limited to, their respective continued employment\nthrough each such date. Additionally, the Retention Bonuses will not vest unless (1) the Merger closes in either calendar year 2022 or 2023 and (2) Mr.\nReich and Mr. Letonoff, respectively, continue to comply with their confidentiality obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if KnowBe4 terminates the\nemployment of Mr. Reich or Mr. Letonoff without cause, then the unvested portion of his Retention Bonus will fully vest and be payable within 60 days\nfollowing such termination of employment, subject to his execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of KnowBe4.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nThe information set forth in the tables below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about\ncertain compensation for each of KnowBe4\u2019s named executive officers (\u201cNEOs\u201d) that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger and assumes, among\nother things, that the Merger is consummated and that the NEOs will incur a severance-qualifying termination of employment immediately following\nconsummation of the Merger. The NEOs for KnowBe4\u2019s fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 included Stu Sjouwerman, Krish Venkataraman and Lars\nLetonoff. Mr. Venkataraman served as KnowBe4\u2019s Co-President and Chief Financial Officer until March 2022, at which time he ceased to be an executive\nofficer and became a member of the KnowBe4 Board.\n \n81\nTable of Contents\nThe amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date,\nincluding assumptions described below, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the consummation of the merger.

Assuming that the NEO experiences an involuntary termination\non December 7, 2022, we do not expect that there will be any earned but unpaid annual bonus. The amount listed represents the NEO\u2019s target annual bonus opportunity, prorated to reflect a termination\non December 7, 2022.\n \n(2)\nAs noted above, each of Mr. Sjouwerman and Mr. Letonoff is eligible for 100 percent acceleration of his KnowBe4 RSU Awards and KnowBe4 PSU Awards in the event he\nexperiences an involuntary termination within 12 months of a change in control. As also noted above, if a change in control occurs during the performance period, then\n100 percent of the shares subject to a KnowBe4 PSU Award will become eligible to vest and be subject to the acceleration rights described in the preceding sentence. We\nexpect that the Merger will close following the end of the performance period applicable to the currently-outstanding KnowBe4 PSU Awards, but as noted above for the\npurposes here we have assumed that the Merger was consummated on December 7, 2022, prior to the end of the performance period. As a result, we have assumed here\nthat KnowBe4 PSU Awards will become eligible to vest at target levels.

A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to\nlong-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder\nacquired different blocks of shares of KnowBe4 common stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis\nand holding period separately with respect to each block of KnowBe4 common stock.\nNon-U.S. Holders \nGeneral\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of KnowBe4 common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder\nnor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSubject to the discussion below relating to FATCA (as defined below), any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n \n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable\nincome tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such\ngain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a\ncorporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax\ntreaty)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the completion of the\nMerger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30\npercent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nKnowBe4 is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code\n(\u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with\nrespect to the applicable shares of KnowBe4 common stock (the \u201crelevant period\u201d) and, if shares of KnowBe4 common stock are regularly\ntraded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly,\nindirectly or constructively) more than five percent of KnowBe4 common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such\ngain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above),\nexcept that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real property\ninterests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests\nplus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real property interests generally include land,\nimprovements and associated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, KnowBe4 believes that it is not, and\nhas not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. Holders are encouraged to consult their\nown tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if it is a USRPHC.\n \n86\nTable of Contents\nWithholding on Foreign Entities\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder (\u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal\nwithholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under these rules) unless such institution\nenters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial\ninformation regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as\ncertain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding\ntax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a certification identifying\ncertain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an\napplicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of\nsuch taxes. The Treasury Department recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal\nwithholding tax of 30 percent applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of KnowBe4 common stock. In its preamble to such proposed\nregulations, the U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nHolders of KnowBe4 common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on the\ndisposition of KnowBe4 common stock pursuant to the Merger.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger.\nBackup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder\nis not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification of\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (b) otherwise establishes an\nexemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be\nallowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.",

The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and\nelsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached\nto this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. KnowBe4 encourages you to carefully read and consider\nthe Merger Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the\ninformation about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the\nMerger Agreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. \nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made only for purposes of\nthe Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to\nimportant qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by KnowBe4, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the Merger Agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports\nand documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by KnowBe4 in\nconnection with the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the\npurpose of allocating contractual risk between KnowBe4, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, rather than to establish\nmatters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the\nrepresentations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger\nAgreement may have the right not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a\nchange in circumstance or otherwise. KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not\nrely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or\ncondition of KnowBe4, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of\nthe representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the\nclosing of the Merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the Merger Agreement after the effective time of the Merger. In addition, you\nshould not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of KnowBe4, Parent and Merger Sub\nbecause the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as\notherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger agreement is described\nbelow, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other\nfactual information regarding KnowBe4, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants\nand other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document\nand in KnowBe4\u2019s filings with the SEC regarding KnowBe4 and its business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger",

Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262\nand in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d or to a \u201cholder of shares\u201d are to a record holder of KnowBe4 common stock.

Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262\nand in this summary to a \u201cperson\u201d are to any individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full\ntext of Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following summary does not\nconstitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section\n262. Holders of record and beneficial owners of shares of KnowBe4 common stock should carefully review the full text of Section 262 as well as the\ninformation discussed below.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, holders of record or beneficial owners of shares of KnowBe4 common stock who (1) submit a written\ndemand for appraisal of such holder\u2019s or owner\u2019s shares of KnowBe4 common stock to KnowBe4 prior to the vote on the Merger Proposal\u037e (2) do not\nvote in favor of the Merger Proposal (whether by voting against the Merger Proposal, abstaining or otherwise not voting with respect to the Merger\nProposal)\u037e (3) continuously hold (in the case of a holder of record) or own (in the case of a beneficial owner) such shares through the effective date of the\nMerger\u037e and (4) otherwise comply with the statutory requirements and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262, may be entitled to\nhave their shares of KnowBe4 common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash for the \u201cfair value\u201d of their\nshares of KnowBe4 common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with (unless\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of\nKnowBe4 common stock and you wish to exercise appraisal rights in such capacity, in addition to the foregoing requirements, your demand must also (1)\nreasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which that demand is made, (2) be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial\nownership of such shares of KnowBe4 common stock and include a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it\npurports to be, and (3) provide an address at which you consent to receive notices given by the surviving corporation and to be set forth on the verified\nlist required by Section 262(f). However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine persons\nentitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number\nof shares of KnowBe4 common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of the class of KnowBe4 common stock eligible\nfor appraisal\u037e or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million. KnowBe4 refers to these\nconditions as the \u201cownership thresholds.\u201d Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest\non an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment at five\npercent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from\n \n141Table of Contents\ntime to time during such period (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary\ncash payment to each person seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid\nand the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The\nsurviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where the proposed merger for which appraisal rights are provided is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of KnowBe4\u2019s\nstockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record date for notice of\nsuch meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or information directing KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders to a\npublicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes KnowBe4\u2019s\nnotice to KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 may be accessed\nwithout subscription or cost at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with\nthe Merger, any holder of record or beneficial owner of shares KnowBe4 common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to\npreserve such holder\u2019s or owner\u2019s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a\ntimely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder or beneficial owner who loses such holder\u2019s or\nowner\u2019s appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price described in the Merger Agreement without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of KnowBe4 common stock, KnowBe4\nbelieves that if a stockholder or a beneficial owner is considering exercising such rights, that stockholder or beneficial owner should seek the advice of\nlegal counsel.\nStockholders or beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock must do ALL of the\nfollowing:\n \n\u2022\nthe stockholder or beneficial owner must not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe stockholder or beneficial owner must deliver to KnowBe4 a written demand for appraisal of such holder\u2019s or owner\u2019s shares of KnowBe4\ncommon stock before the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold or the beneficial owner must continuously own the shares from the date of making the demand\nthrough the effective date of the Merger (a stockholder or beneficial owner will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder or beneficial owner\ntransfers the shares before the effective date of the Merger).\nAny person who has complied with the applicable requirements of Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights or the surviving corporation\nmay file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such persons within 120 days after the\neffective date of the Merger (the surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so).\nIn addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine persons entitled to appraisal rights, will\ndismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\nFor stockholders, because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, each\nstockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the Merger Proposal, abstain or not vote his, her or its\nshares.\n \n142\nTable of Contents\nWritten Demand",

In addition, that stockholder or beneficial\nowner must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal. A vote in favor of the Merger Proposal, in person at the Special Meeting or by\nproxy (whether by mail or via the Internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any\npreviously filed written demands for appraisal with respect to such stockholder\u2019s shares. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record\nthe shares of KnowBe4 common stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the\neffective date of the Merger. A beneficial owner exercising appraisal rights must own the shares of KnowBe4 common stock on the date the written\ndemand for appraisal is made and must continue to own such shares through the effective date of the Merger.

The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and\nKnowBe4\u2019s stockholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of\nthe shares of KnowBe4 common stock. Accordingly, any persons who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect\ntheir appraisal rights in respect of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file\nsuch a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for an appraisal of such person\u2019s shares\npursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of\nshares not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which KnowBe4 has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of\nstockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand pursuant to Section 262, the\nholder of record of such shares will not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate number). The\nsurviving corporation must send this statement to the requesting person within 10 days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request\nfor such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a person and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be\nobligated within 20 days after such service to file in the office of the Delaware Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list\ncontaining the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their\nshares have not been reached.

Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of KnowBe4\ncommon stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid\nupon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the\njudgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings,\nto make a voluntary cash payment to each person seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection\n(h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in\nsuch voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest accrued before such\nvoluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in\nthe financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant\nfactors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider\nmarket value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the\nMerger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion\nis a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising\nfrom such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature\nof the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be\nmore than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an\nopinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to,\nand may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although KnowBe4 believes that the Per Share Price is fair, no representation is made\nas to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the\n \n145Table of Contents\nDelaware Court of Chancery, and KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or\nlower than, or the same as, the Per Share Price. Neither KnowBe4 nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Price to any stockholder or\nbeneficial owner exercising appraisal rights, and each of KnowBe4 and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to\nsubsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of KnowBe4 common\nstock is less than the Per Share Price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in\nrespect of persons seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include\nattorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving\ncorporation pursuant to Section 262(f) who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section 262 or\nsubject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of judgment under such subsection (a \u201cReservation\u201d). In the absence of such determination or\nassessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of KnowBe4 common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly withdraws,\nsuch person\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of KnowBe4 common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the\nMerger into the right to receive the Per Share Price as provided in the Merger Agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such person\u2019s\nright to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has\nbeen satisfied in respect of persons seeking appraisal rights or if the person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Price as provided in the Merger Agreement in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the effective date of the Merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person\u2019s shares in\ncompliance with Section 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of KnowBe4 common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other\ndistributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the\nMerger)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds\nabove has been satisfied in respect of the persons seeking appraisal rights or if such person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of\nsuch person\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger, then the right of such\nperson to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any\nperson without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems just, including, without limitation, a Reservation\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing will not affect the right of any person who has\nnot commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nterms offered upon the Merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a person\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. In that event,\nyou will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the Merger Agreement, without interest and less any\napplicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any person wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to\nexercise those rights.\n \n146\nTable of Contents\nPROPOSAL 1: THE MERGER PROPOSAL",

The various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made generally have previously formed\npart of KnowBe4\u2019s overall compensation program for its named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of its\nannual proxy statement. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the KnowBe4 Board, which is\ncomposed solely of non-employee directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.\nAccordingly, KnowBe4 is seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the stockholders of KnowBe4 approve the compensation that will or may become payable to KnowBe4\u2019s named executive\nofficers in connection with the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Interests\nof KnowBe4\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d in KnowBe4\u2019s proxy statement for the Special\nMeeting.\u201d\nKnowBe4\u2019s stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as a non-binding, advisory vote, the result\nwill not be binding on KnowBe4, the KnowBe4 Board or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their\nterms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated KnowBe4\u2019s named\nexecutive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and\nconditions applicable to those payments.\nThe KnowBe4 Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d this proposal. \n \n148Table of Contents\nPROPOSAL 3: THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL",

From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no\nlonger be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist\u037e and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously\nrepresenting any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration\npayable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL). The\nconsideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been\npaid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further\nregistration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately\nprior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time.\nIf, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to\ncompliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.\n2.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in\nexchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section\n2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such\nlost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent,\nthe Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.\n2.12 Required Withholding.

If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to\ncarry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with the full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of\nMerger Sub and the Company, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent will be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub,\nin the name of the Company, and otherwise) to take such action.\n \nA-32\nTable of Contents\nARTICLE III\nREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY\nWith respect to any Section of this Article III, except (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed publicly no later than one (1) Business Day prior\nto the date of this Agreement (other than (i) with respect to Section 3.2, Section 3.3 or Section 3.7, or (ii) any disclosures contained or referenced therein\nunder the captions \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d and any other\ndisclosures contained or referenced therein of information, factors or risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature)\u037e or (b) subject to\nthe terms of Section 1.3(u), as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:\n3.1 Organization\u037e Good Standing.
