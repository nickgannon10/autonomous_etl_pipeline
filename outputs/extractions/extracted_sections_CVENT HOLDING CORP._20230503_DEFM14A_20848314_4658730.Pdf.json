            "text": "Appraisal Rights (page 109)\nPursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, Cvent stockholders who continuously hold shares of Cvent common stock\nthrough the Effective Time and who do not vote such shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and\nbeneficial owners of shares of Cvent common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such\nperson who beneficially own shares of Cvent common stock through the Effective Time that are not voted in favor of\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement, and in either case who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not\nwithdraw their demands and otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be\nentitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Cvent common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL. The \u201cfair value\u201d of shares of Cvent common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could\nbe greater than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration that stockholders or beneficial owners would\notherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their\nshares of Cvent common stock.\nThe right to seek appraisal will be lost with respect to shares that a Cvent stockholder votes \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement. However, abstaining or voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement is not in\nitself sufficient to perfect appraisal rights because additional actions must also be taken to perfect such rights. To\nexercise appraisal rights, Cvent stockholders (or beneficial owners of shares of Cvent common stock held either in\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their\nshares must so advise the Company by submitting a written demand for appraisal to the Company prior to the taking\nof the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting, and must otherwise strictly follow the applicable\nprocedures and requirements prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. Any demand for appraisal made by a beneficial\nholder of shares of Cvent common stock with respect to shares held of record in the name of a voting trust or\nnominee, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, on behalf of such person must (a) reasonably identify the holder\nof record of the shares for which the demand is made, (b) provide documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s\nbeneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports\nto be and (c) provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company\nand the office of the Register in Chancery and to be set forth on the verified list required by Section 262(f) of the\nDGCL. In addition, under Section 262 of the DGCL, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal\nproceedings as to all stockholders and beneficial owners who have perfected their appraisal rights unless (i) the total\nnumber of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Cvent common stock or (ii) the value\nof the per share Merger Consideration multiplied by the total number of shares of Cvent common stock entitled to\nappraisal exceeds $1 million.\nIn view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, Cvent stockholders and beneficial owners that may wish to\npursue appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors.\n10TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAccounting Treatment (page 77)",

            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the\nSpecial Meeting and the Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important\nto you as a holder of Cvent common stock. You should read the more detailed information contained elsewhere in\nthis proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this proxy statement.\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\nOn March 14, 2023, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Cvent, with Cvent surviving as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Parent.\nYou are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Cvent Board in favor of\nthe proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting as\ndescribed in this proxy statement.\nAs a holder of Cvent common stock, what will I receive in the Merger?\nEach share of Cvent common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other\nthan shares of Cvent common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or Merger Sub\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders or beneficial owners thereof have properly exercised\ntheir statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) will be automatically canceled,\nextinguished and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.\nThe exchange of shares of Cvent common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For a more detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the Merger, see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Material U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Considerations.\u201d You are urged to consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of how the\nMerger will affect you for federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. tax purposes.\nHow does the Merger Consideration compare to the recent trading price of Cvent common stock?\nThe Merger Consideration of $8.50 per share represents a premium of approximately 52% to the volume weighted\naverage share price over the 90 days prior to January 30, 2023 - the day before media reports of a potential transaction\nwere published. On May 2, 2023, the most recent practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement, the closing\nprice of Cvent common stock was $8.42 per share.\nWhat will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the Merger?\nEach Option granted in 2022 (other than Options granted to Mr. Aggarwal which will be governed by their original\nterms) will be modified so that the tranche of such Option that would have otherwise vested in 2026 will instead vest\n(a) 40% on July 1, 2024 and (b) 60% on July 1, 2025, in each case, subject to the holder\u2019s continued service through\nthe applicable vesting dates.\nEach Vested Option, in each case, with an exercise price per share less than the Merger Consideration will, at the\nEffective Time, be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest\nand subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Cvent common stock\nsubject to such Vested Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the excess of the Merger\nConsideration minus the per share exercise price of such Vested Option.\nEach Unvested Option that has an exercise price per share less than the Merger Consideration will, at the Effective\nTime, be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Cash Replacement Option Amounts,\nwhich Cash Replacement Option Amounts will, subject to the holder\u2019s continued service through the applicable\nvesting dates, generally vest and be payable (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) at the\nsame time as the Unvested Options for which the Cash Replacement Option Amounts were exchanged would have\nvested pursuant to their terms.\nEach Option (whether a Vested Option or an Unvested Option) with an exercise price per share that is equal to or\ngreater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time for no consideration.\n12TABLE OF CONTENTS\nEach RSU award granted in 2022 (other than RSU awards granted to Mr. Aggarwal which will be governed by their\noriginal terms) will be modified so that the tranche of such RSU award that would have otherwise vested in 2026 will\ninstead vest (a) 40% on July 1, 2024 and (b) 60% on July 1, 2025, in each case, subject to the holder\u2019s continued\nservice through the applicable vesting dates.\nEach Vested RSU award will automatically, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive\nan amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the\nMerger Consideration and (b) the total number of shares of Cvent common stock subject to such Vested RSU award\nas of immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nEach Unvested RSU award will automatically, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into and will become\nthe right to receive the Cash Replacement RSU Amounts, which Cash Replacement RSU Amounts will, subject to the\nholder\u2019s continued service through the applicable vesting dates, generally vest and be payable (without interest and\nsubject to applicable withholding taxes) at the same time as the Unvested RSU awards for which the Cash\nReplacement RSU Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to their terms.\nWhen and where is the Special Meeting of our stockholders?\nThe special meeting will be held virtually on Thursday, June 1, 2023, at 9 a.m., Eastern time. Cvent is conducting the\nSpecial Meeting solely online via the Internet through a live webcast and online stockholder tools. Stockholders will\nbe able to attend the Special Meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CVT2023SM and by using the\n16-digit control number included in their proxy materials.\nWho is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?\nOnly holders of record of Cvent common stock as of the close of business on May 1, 2023, the record date for the\nSpecial Meeting, are entitled to vote the shares of Cvent common stock they held as of the record date at the Special\nMeeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 491,620,840 shares of Cvent common stock\nissued and outstanding and entitled to vote.

The\ninspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will determine whether a quorum is present. The inspector of\nelection will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not\npresent, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the adjournment or postponement of the\nmeeting to another date or time.\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?\nAssuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders\nholding a majority of the outstanding shares of Cvent common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on\nthe record date. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting\n(whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions\nto such holder\u2019s bank, broker or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nMerger Proposal.\nCertain stockholders of the Company have executed the Voting Agreements concurrently with the execution of the\nMerger Agreement, pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed, among other things, to vote all shares of\nCvent common stock owned by them, collectively constituting approximately 87.5% of the Company\u2019s outstanding\ncommon stock, in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement. For more information, see the section\nof this proxy statement titled \u201cVoting Agreements.\u201d\nAssuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory, non-binding basis,\nrequires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Cvent common stock present, in person or\nrepresented by proxy, at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is\npresent, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to vote or a\n\u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder\u2019s bank, broker or other nominee) will\nhave no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Compensation Proposal. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory and non-binding\nand is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.\nAssuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Cvent common stock present, in person or represented\nby proxy, at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present, shares\ndeemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d\nholder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder\u2019s bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect\non the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nAdjournment Proposal.\nWhat is a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d?\nIf a beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a bank, broker or other nominee does\nnot provide the organization that holds the owner\u2019s shares with specific voting instructions, then, under\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\napplicable rules, the organization that holds the owner\u2019s shares may generally vote on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d matters but\ncannot vote on \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d matters. A so-called \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d results when banks, brokers and other\nnominees return a valid proxy voting upon one or more other matters for which the applicable rules provide\ndiscretionary authority or for which voting instructions have been provided but do not vote on a particular proposal\nbecause they do not have discretionary authority to vote on that matter and have not received specific voting\ninstructions on that matter from the beneficial owner of relevant shares. Cvent does not expect any broker non-votes\nat the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with\ndiscretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be\npresented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be\npermitted to vote your shares of Cvent common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure\nto instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of Cvent common stock will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation\nProposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nHow do the Special Committee and the Cvent Board recommend that I vote?\nThe Cvent Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger\nProposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Cvent Board considered in determining to recommend that Cvent\nstockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Reasons for\nthe Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Special Committee and the Cvent Board.\u201d In addition, in considering the\nrecommendation of the Cvent Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that certain of the\nCompany\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of\nthe Company\u2019s stockholders generally. See the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Interests of the\nCompany\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nWhy am I being asked to cast an advisory, non-binding vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or may\nbecome payable to Cvent\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nThe SEC, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, adopted rules\nthat require the Company to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments that may be made\nto the Company\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nWhat will happen if the Company\u2019s stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal?\nThe vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nBecause the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Cvent, the Cvent Board,\nParent or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, because Cvent is contractually obligated to pay the compensation,\nif the Merger Agreement is adopted by the holders of Cvent common stock and the Merger is completed, the\ncompensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of this\nadvisory, non-binding vote.\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Cvent common stock before the Special Meeting?\nThe record date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you sell or transfer your\nshares of Cvent common stock after the record date, but before the Special Meeting, you will retain your right to vote\nsuch shares at the Special Meeting. However, the right to receive the Merger Consideration will pass to the person to\nwhom you transferred your shares. In order to receive the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, you\nmust hold your shares of Cvent common stock through the Effective Time. In addition, if you demand appraisal for\nany of your shares of Cvent common stock, you will lose your right to appraisal with respect to any such shares that\nyou thereafter sell or transfer prior to the Effective Time.\nWhat is a proxy?\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Cvent common stock. The written\ndocument describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d\nThe document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Cvent common stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will\nvote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card,\nyou may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of\nthe specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a\nmatter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the\nCompensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nHow do I cast my vote if I am a stockholder of record?\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust\nCompany, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In that case, this proxy\nstatement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.\nIf you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may vote by submitting your proxy via the Internet, by\ntelephone or by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid reply envelope. You\nmay also vote your shares by ballot via the Internet during the Special Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the\nSpecial Meeting, you are encouraged to submit your vote by proxy as early as possible to ensure that your shares\nwill be represented. For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, see the section of this\nproxy statement titled \u201cThe Special Meeting - Voting Procedures.\u201d\nIf you are a holder of record of shares of Cvent common stock and you submit a proxy card or voting instructions\nbut do not direct how to vote on each item, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares in favor of each of the\nMerger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the Adjournment Proposal.\nHow do I cast my vote if my shares of Cvent common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank, broker or other\nnominee?\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of shares\nof Cvent common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your\nbank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record.\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you must follow the\ninstructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote such shares.

This means that holders and such beneficial owners of shares of Cvent common stock are entitled to\nhave their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of\ntheir shares of Cvent common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by\nthe court (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference between the amount determined to be the\nfair value and the amount paid to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal\nproceeding).

The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising\nappraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and Section 262 of the DGCL regarding\nappraisal rights is accessible without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. See the section of this proxy\nstatement titled \u201cAppraisal Rights.\u201d\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\nWe are working toward completing the Merger as promptly as possible, and currently expect the transaction to close\nmid-year 2023, pending the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and a stockholder vote in favor of the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be accurately predicted,\nbecause the Merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of the\nconditions to Parent\u2019s, Merger Sub\u2019s and the Company\u2019s respective obligations to consummate the Merger, some of\nwhich are not within the parties\u2019 control. According to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the consummation of the\nMerger will not occur prior to June 15, 2023, without the prior written consent of Parent.\nWhat effect will the Merger have on Cvent?\nIf the Merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Cvent, the separate corporate existence of\nMerger Sub will thereupon cease, and Cvent will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Parent. Following completion of the Merger, shares of Cvent common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq, and the\nregistration of shares of Cvent common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated.\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nIf the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,\nthe holders of Cvent common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of Cvent common stock in\nconnection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company and stockholders will\ncontinue to own their shares of Cvent common stock. Cvent common stock will continue to be registered under the\nExchange Act and listed and traded on Nasdaq. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, Cvent\nmay be obligated to pay to Parent a termination fee or Parent may be obligated to pay to Cvent a termination fee, as\napplicable. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Termination\nFees and Expenses.\u201d\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more\nstockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance\nnotice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the\nmeeting and proxy card. If your shares are held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you will receive your proxy card or other voting\ninformation from your bank, broker or other nominee and you will return your proxy card(s) to your bank, broker or\nother nominee. You should vote on and sign each proxy card you receive as discussed above. To request that only\none copy of any of these materials be mailed to your household, please contact your bank, broker or other nominee.\nWho can help answer my questions?\nIf you need assistance in completing your proxy card or have questions regarding the Special Meeting, please\ncontact Cvent\u2019s Investor Relations team:\nCvent Holding Corp.\nAttn: Investor Relations \n1765 Greensboro Station Place, 7th Floor\nTysons, Virginia 22102\nTelephone: (703) 226-3500\nEmail: CventIR@icrinc.com\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",

Follow the instructions for Internet voting shown on the proxy card mailed to you.\n\u2022\nBy Telephone. Follow the instructions for telephone voting shown on the proxy card mailed to you.\n\u2022\nBy Proxy Card. Complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid reply\nenvelope.\nThe Internet and telephone procedures for submitting proxies are designed to authenticate your identity and to allow\nyou to cause your shares of Cvent common stock to be voted for the matters brought before the Special Meeting as\ndescribed in this proxy statement and confirm that your proxy has been properly recorded.\nProxies submitted by telephone or via the Internet for the matters brought before the Special Meeting as described in\nthis proxy statement must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, May 31, 2023.\nIf you submit your proxy via the Internet, by telephone or by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy\ncard by mail, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares according to your instructions. If you are a\nstockholder with shares of Cvent common stock registered in your name and submit your proxy but do not direct\nthe persons named as proxies how to vote your shares on a proposal to be brought before the Special Meeting, the\npersons named as proxies will vote your shares in favor of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal.\nIf a beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a bank, broker or other nominee does\nnot provide the organization that holds its shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the\norganization that holds its shares may generally vote on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d matters but cannot vote on \u201cnon-\ndiscretionary\u201d matters. A so-called \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid\nproxy voting upon one or more matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority or for which\nvoting instructions have been provided but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have\ndiscretionary authority to vote on that matter and have not received specific voting instructions on that matter from\nthe beneficial owner of relevant shares. Cvent does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because\nthe rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote\non proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is\nconsidered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Cvent common stock at the\nSpecial Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to\nvote your shares of Cvent common stock will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement.\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a bank, broker or other\nnominee, you must follow the instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote your shares. If\nyou follow the instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee for voting your shares, then your bank, broker or\nother nominee will vote your shares according to your instructions. Under applicable rules, your bank, broker or\n25TABLE OF CONTENTS\nother nominee has authority to vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by properly\ncompleting the voting instruction form sent to you by your bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement.\nIf you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee on a proposal to be brought before\nthe Special Meeting, your shares will not be voted on that proposal, and if you do not provide voting instructions on\nany of the proposals to be brought before the Special Meeting, your shares will not be deemed to be in attendance at\nthe meeting.\nRevocation of Proxies",

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThe following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board, the Transaction\nCommittee, the Special Committee or the representatives of the Company and other parties.\nThe Board and the Company\u2019s senior management periodically review the Company\u2019s long-term strategy and\nobjectives in light of market and industry conditions. These reviews have included, among other things,\nconsideration of organic growth initiatives, acquisitions, divestitures, and potential business combination\ntransactions, as well as other strategic opportunities, in each case, with a view towards enhancing stockholder value.\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s deSPAC transaction in late 2021, an affiliate of Blackstone made an investment in\nthe Company\u2019s common stock. As a result of such investment, from time to time, Rajeev K. Aggarwal, the chief\nexecutive officer of the Company, engaged in periodic discussions following such investment through April 2022,\nwith representatives of Blackstone, with whom Mr. Aggarwal had a longstanding relationship. Such individuals did\nnot discuss a potential transaction or any specific terms during these discussions nor were there discussions\nregarding a rollover or other investment from any of the Company\u2019s stockholders with such individuals.\nIn late April 2022, a representative of Blackstone\u2019s private equity business was introduced via e-mail to Nicolas Stahl,\na member of the Board and a representative of a major stockholder of the Company, Vista. The Blackstone\nrepresentative and Mr. Stahl did not discuss a potential transaction or any specific terms thereof.\nOn April 27, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal met in person with a representative of a financial sponsor, which we refer to herein as\n\u201cParty A,\u201d with which Mr. Aggarwal had a longstanding relationship. The Party A representative informed Mr.\nAggarwal of Party A\u2019s interest in learning more about the Company but did not discuss a potential transaction or any\nspecific terms thereof.\nOn May 10, 2022, Mr. Stahl met telephonically with a representative of Blackstone, who informed Mr. Stahl of\nBlackstone\u2019s interest in learning more about the Company, but did not discuss a potential transaction or any specific\nterms thereof. In the following months prior to the submission of the November Proposal (as defined below), the\nrepresentative of Blackstone and representatives of Vista periodically discussed the Company but did not discuss a\npotential transaction or any specific terms thereof.\nOn June 5, 2022, a representative of the Blackstone business unit invested in the Company called Mr. Aggarwal, and\nthe Blackstone representative informed Mr. Aggarwal of Blackstone\u2019s interest in learning more about the Company\nbut did not discuss a potential transaction or any specific terms thereof.\nIn June 2022, Mr. Aggarwal met in person with a representative of the Blackstone business unit invested in the\nCompany to discuss the Company\u2019s business and the industry in which the Company operates. Mr. Aggarwal and\nthe Blackstone representative did not discuss a potential transaction or any specific terms thereof.\nOn July 8, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal met telephonically with a representative of the Blackstone business unit invested in\nthe Company but did not discuss a potential transaction or any specific terms thereof.\n32TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 12, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal met telephonically with a representative of Blackstone, who noted that Blackstone\nhad followed the Company and wanted to get to learn more about the Company and its business but did not discuss\na potential transaction or any specific terms thereof.\nOn July 25, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal met in person with a representative of the Blackstone business unit invested in the\nCompany to discuss the Company and its industry generally. Mr. Aggarwal and the Blackstone representative did\nnot discuss a potential transaction or any specific terms thereof. After such meeting, Mr. Aggarwal informed Monti\nSaroya, the Chairman of the Board, of the discussions with Blackstone.\nOn August 8, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal met via video conference with representatives of Blackstone\u2019s private equity\nbusiness to discuss the Company\u2019s business. Mr. Aggarwal and the Blackstone representatives did not discuss a\npotential transaction or any specific terms thereof.\nOn September 8, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal met in person with representatives of Blackstone to discuss the Company\u2019s\nbusiness and the industry in which the Company operates. Mr. Aggarwal and the Blackstone representatives did not\ndiscuss a potential transaction or any specific terms thereof.\nOn September 19, 2022, a representative of Party A called Mr. Aggarwal and requested the opportunity to set up a\nmeeting with members of the Company\u2019s management team to discuss the Company\u2019s business. Mr. Aggarwal\nresponded that the Company was focused on executing on its plan for the remainder of the year and that it might\nmake sense to connect again near the end of the year.\nOn October 21, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal met telephonically with a representative of the Blackstone business unit invested\nin the Company, and the Blackstone representative noted that Blackstone may be interested in a potential acquisition\nof the Company but did not make a proposal for a potential transaction or discuss any specific terms thereof.\nOn October 25, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal met telephonically with a representative of the Blackstone business unit invested\nin the Company, and the Blackstone representative reiterated Blackstone\u2019s potential interest in an acquisition of the\nCompany but did not make a proposal for a potential transaction or discuss any specific terms thereof. After this\nmeeting, Mr. Aggarwal informed Messrs. Saroya and Stahl of the discussion with Blackstone.\nOn October 26, 2022, a representative of the Blackstone business unit invested in the Company called Mr. Aggarwal,\nand the representative of Blackstone proposed to set up a call between Mr. Aggarwal and representatives of\nBlackstone's private equity business who were interested in learning more about the Company, but did not discuss a\npotential transaction or any specific terms thereof.\nOn October 28, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal met via video conference with representatives of Blackstone, and the\nrepresentatives of Blackstone reiterated Blackstone\u2019s potential interest in an acquisition of the Company and\ndiscussed the Company\u2019s business but did not make a proposal for a potential transaction or discuss any specific\nterms at that time.\nOn November 1, 2022, representatives of Blackstone called Mr. Aggarwal and informed him that Blackstone intended\nto submit an indication of interest with respect to a potential acquisition of the Company but did not propose any\nspecific terms at that time.\nOn November 7, 2022, a representative of Blackstone called Mr. Saroya to indicate that Blackstone expected to submit\na letter of interest to the Board in the coming days. The representative of Blackstone did not make a proposal for a\npotential transaction or discuss any specific terms at that time, and there was no discussion regarding a rollover or\nother investment from any of the Company\u2019s stockholders. The representative of Vista indicated that Blackstone\nshould submit a letter of interest to the Board if Blackstone desired to proceed further.\nOn November 13, 2022, Blackstone submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the Chairman of the Board,\nbased upon a review of publicly available information, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of\nthe Company for a range of $8.00-$8.50 per share (the \u201cNovember Proposal\u201d), in cash, representing a 38%-47%\npremium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $5.79 as of November 11, 2022. The November Proposal specified\nthat, while Blackstone would be open to discussing a potential equity rollover from the Company\u2019s stockholders,\nBlackstone did not contemplate or require any such rollover or other investment from any such stockholders.\nBlackstone requested in the November Proposal that the Company engage exclusively with Blackstone regarding a\npotential transaction for a period of 30 days. The November Proposal was distributed to the Board on November 14,\n2022.\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 17, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of\nKirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d), the Company\u2019s outside legal advisor, in attendance. Mr. Aggarwal updated the\nBoard on his conversation with Blackstone on October 28, 2022 and described the terms of the November Proposal to\nthe Board. Representatives of Kirkland reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in\nthe context of receipt of an unsolicited acquisition proposal, and discussed certain process considerations for the\nBoard when responding to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. At the meeting, the Board considered and discussed\nwhether the timing was appropriate to explore a potential sale transaction, including the relative risks and benefits\nthereof, with the Board focusing on, among other things, the probability of consummating a successful sale at a\ncompelling value and the challenges facing the industry in which the Company operates. Mr. Saroya noted that Vista\nwould be supportive of a transaction if it was at a compelling value that was in the best interest of all stockholders,\nand that Vista would expect to be a seller only in any transaction and would not seek to roll over any of its equity\nownership or be interested in acquiring the Company, either alone or as part of a consortium. At the meeting, the\nBoard also authorized the Company to use an acknowledgment letter to be signed by members of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement who became aware of and involved in the process, agreeing to (a) cooperate fully with the Board, (b)\nkeep all information strictly confidential, and (c) not engage in discussions with any potential buyer (or\nrepresentatives thereof) unless authorized by the Board, including with respect to such person\u2019s equity participation,\nor ongoing employment or compensation with, such potential buyer. Following this discussion, the Board decided to\nengage a financial advisor to assist the Company\u2019s management and the Board in identifying other parties that might\nhave interest in a strategic transaction involving the Company and to assist the Board in exploring strategic\nalternatives, including continuing as a standalone company. The Board considered the Company\u2019s existing\ninvestment banking relationships and the qualifications and experience of those financial advisors. The Board\nauthorized the Company\u2019s management to contact Qatalyst Partners, as well as one other financial advisor, and to\nselect a financial advisor for assistance with the exploratory process for a strategic transaction. The Board\u2019s decision\nto contact these two financial advisors was based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 and the other financial advisor\u2019s\nqualifications and experience advising, and familiarity with, companies operating in the same industry as the\nCompany. In addition, the Board determined to form an ad-hoc transaction committee of the Board (the \u201cTransaction\nCommittee\u201d) for convenience and efficiency, and not to address any potential conflicts of interest. The Board\ninstructed management, with the assistance of the Transaction Committee and a financial advisor, once selected, to\nidentify a list of parties most likely to be interested in exploring a transaction with the Company, and to conduct\noutreach to such parties to gauge their interest in a potential transaction involving the Company. The Board also\ninstructed Mr. Aggarwal, following consultation with a financial advisor, once selected, to inform Blackstone that the\nBoard was reviewing the November Proposal. Further, the Board instructed the Company\u2019s management to begin\npreparing long range projections to assist with the evaluation of a potential acquisition of the Company.\nLater in the day on November 17, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and the other\nfinancial advisor.\nOn November 21, 2022, members of management and the Board met with representatives of each of the financial\nadvisors. Following those meetings, the Transaction Committee, consisting of Mr. Aggarwal, Mr. Saroya, Mr. Stahl\nand Marcela Martin, held a meeting, with Board member Jim Frankola and members of the Company\u2019s management in\nattendance, and, subject to review of a relationship disclosure letter from Qatalyst Partners, determined to engage\nQatalyst Partners as the Company\u2019s financial advisor due to Qatalyst Partners\u2019 qualifications and experience\nadvising, and familiarity with, companies in the same industry as the Company. The Transaction Committee also\ndiscussed potential bidders for the Company, taking into account relationships with potential bidders who had\nexpressed an interest for the Company prior to or in connection with its deSPAC transaction in 2021, and determined\nto instruct Qatalyst Partners to conduct outreach to the potential bidders viewed as most likely to be interested in a\ntransaction involving the Company.\nOn November 23, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal contacted a representative of Blackstone to inform Blackstone that the Board\nwas reviewing the November Proposal and that Qatalyst Partners had been retained as the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisor, and that future communications should be directed to Qatalyst Partners.\nBetween November 23 and November 29, 2022, following consultation with members of the Transaction Committee\nand Company management regarding the appropriate scope and participants in the strategic process, at the direction\nof the Transaction Committee, representatives of Qatalyst Partners conducted outreach to eight other potential\ncounterparties viewed as most likely to be interested in a transaction involving the Company, including four strategic\ncounterparties and four financial sponsors (including Party A and a financial sponsor, which we refer to herein as\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201cParty B\u201d). All of these potential counterparties other than Party A and Party B either informed representatives of\nQatalyst Partners that they were not interested in a potential acquisition of the Company citing other strategic\npriorities and/or a lack of familiarity with the Company or determined not to engage following such outreach. Party A\nand Party B each informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they were interested in a potential acquisition of\nthe Company. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners instructed each of Party A and Party B to submit a preliminary\nindication of interest to the Board based on publicly available information.\nOn November 27, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners held an introductory call with representatives of\nBlackstone.\nOn November 29, 2022, Qatalyst Partners delivered its relationship disclosure letter to the Board.\nOn November 30, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, the Board ratified the formation of the Transaction\nCommittee with Mr. Saroya, Mr. Stahl, Ms. Martin and Mr. Aggarwal as the members. The Board authorized the\nTransaction Committee to assist management with respect to negotiating a possible transaction and to provide timely\nBoard input on issues as they arose\u037e provided that any potential transaction involving the Company would need to\nbe approved by the full Board. Also at the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners updated the Board on the\nprocess undertaken by the Company to date, including discussions with Blackstone regarding the November\nProposal, and Qatalyst Partners\u2019 targeted outreach to other parties selected by the Transaction Committee based on\ntheir potential interest in the Company and their ability to complete a transaction of this kind. At the meeting, given\nthat certain parties contacted had passed on the opportunity or were viewed by the Board as unlikely to be able to\nproceed with a potential transaction, the Board instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to conduct outreach\nto two additional financial sponsors, which we refer to herein as \u201cParty C\u201d and \u201cParty D,\u201d who were viewed as the\nnext most likely parties to be interested in a transaction involving the Company. Representatives of Kirkland also\nreviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in the context of evaluating the November\nProposal and other strategic alternatives, including continuing as a standalone company. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners also reviewed with the Board certain preliminary financial analyses with respect to the November Proposal.\nThe Board members concluded that, based on the then-existing facts and circumstances, the Board would seek to\ntransact at a higher value than as proposed in the November Proposal, and also discussed the response to the\nNovember Proposal (including that the Company would not agree to Blackstone\u2019s request for exclusivity). The Board\nagreed, and directed Qatalyst Partners, to convey the Board\u2019s view with respect to the November Proposal to\nBlackstone and to continue engaging with Blackstone and with other potential parties to gauge interest. The Board\nalso determined to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Blackstone in order to provide Blackstone with non-\npublic information to facilitate preliminary diligence to support an increased offer. After representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners left the meeting, the Board also reviewed Qatalyst Partners\u2019 relationship disclosure letter and determined\nthat, based on the letter, it believed that Qatalyst Partners did not have any conflicts that would affect the ability of\nQatalyst Partners to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to the Board.\nAlso on November 30, 2022, Party B called representatives of Qatalyst Partners to communicate that, based upon a\nreview of publicly available information, if it were to submit a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of\ncommon stock of the Company, such proposal would be in a range of $7.00-$7.25 per share (the \u201cParty B Indication\u201d),\nin cash, representing a 32%-37% premium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $5.29 as of November 29, 2022. The\nParty B Indication did not contemplate terms regarding a rollover or other investment from any of the Company\u2019s\nstockholders.\nOn December 1 and 2, 2022, following consultation with and at the direction of the Transaction Committee,\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners and the Company\u2019s management informed representatives of Party B that the\nproposed value in the Party B Indication was below a value at which the Company sought to transact and that Party\nB would need to improve its view on valuation in order to receive access to non-public information and continue with\ndiscussions. Party B agreed to discuss internally and would revert if it was able to improve its view on valuation.\nParty B did not respond with an improved proposal following such discussion.\nOn December 2, 2022, as directed by the Board, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke to representatives of\nBlackstone to communicate that the Board was seeking to transact at a higher value than as proposed in the\nNovember Proposal and to outline the process for Blackstone to gain access to non-public information, complete\ntheir preliminary diligence and submit an improved proposal.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBetween December 2 and December 4, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners conducted outreach to Party C and\nParty D, as directed by the Board. Party D informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it was not interested in a\npotential acquisition of the Company due to lack of historical focus on the event management space. Party C\ninformed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it was interested in a potential acquisition of the Company.\nRepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners instructed Party C to submit a preliminary indication of interest to the Board\nbased on publicly available information.\nOn December 3, 2022, representatives of Blackstone submitted a request to representatives of Qatalyst Partners to\ncommence discussions with a limited group of lenders in connection with a potential acquisition of the Company,\nwhich request was promptly passed along to the Company\u2019s management and the Board.\nOn December 5, 2022, Party A submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the Board, based upon a review of\npublicly available information, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $7.60 per\nshare (the \u201cParty A Proposal\u201d), in cash, representing a 38% premium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $5.51 as\nof December 2, 2022. The Party A Proposal did not contemplate terms regarding a rollover or other investment from\nany of the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Party A Proposal also indicated that, based upon certain assumptions\nregarding the availability of debt financing, Party A would need to find a partner to underwrite approximately $700\nmillion of additional equity capital prior to the signing of definitive transaction documents. The Party A Proposal was\npromptly distributed to the Board for review.\nOn December 6, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners updated the Board\non the process undertaken by the Company to date, including discussions with each of Blackstone and Party A\nregarding the November Proposal and the Party A Proposal, respectively. The Board instructed the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners to continue engaging with Blackstone. Further, the Board\ndetermined to allow Blackstone to commence discussions with a limited group of lenders (but only those affiliated\nwith Blackstone) in response to Blackstone\u2019s request on December 3, 2022, so long as such lenders were bound by\nconfidentiality provisions at least as restrictive as the confidentiality agreement to be entered into by Blackstone and\nthe Company, which determination the Board instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to convey to\nBlackstone. The Board also determined that the Party A Proposal was sufficiently below a value at which the\nCompany sought to transact such that Party A should not be granted access to non-public information without\nimproving its price per share based on publicly available information. The Board instructed representatives of\nQatalyst Partners to communicate this message to representatives of Party A.\nAlso at the meeting, the Company\u2019s management presented the December Projections (as defined below in the\nsection of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Certain Financial Projections\u201d), a new set of three-year long-\nrange projections prepared by management at the request of the Board in connection with the evaluation of a\npotential acquisition of the Company, as well as a comparison of the December Projections with the Company\u2019s long\nrange projection model from the time of the Company\u2019s deSPAC transaction in 2021. The Board then approved the\nDecember Projections (i) for sharing with Blackstone and any other interested parties who had submitted sufficient\nindications of interest and entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company, which, in each case, were\npromptly shared at such time as each of the interested parties was given access to the virtual data room, and (ii) for\nuse by Qatalyst Partners for purposes of preparing financial analyses in connection with the Board\u2019s evaluation of\nany potential strategic transaction, which were promptly shared with Qatalyst Partners.\nAfter the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners conveyed the Board-directed messages to each of Blackstone\nand Party A.\nOn December 7, 2022, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Blackstone. The confidentiality\nagreement includes customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that prohibited\nBlackstone (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to acquire or acquiring the Company, and\nfrom taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies and making any request to amend, waive or terminate\nthe standstill provision, in each case, without the prior consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement\npermitted Blackstone to make acquisition proposals at any time after the Company entered into a definitive agreement\nwith a third party providing for a change of control transaction of the Company. The confidentiality agreement also\nprohibited Blackstone from entering into any exclusivity or lock-up arrangement with any financing source and no\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\napproval for Blackstone to enter into any such arrangement was ever provided by the Company. This agreement also\nprohibited Blackstone from having discussions with the Company\u2019s management team regarding an equity rollover or\nany post-transaction employment or compensation matters without the prior written consent of the Board.\nAlso on December 7, 2022, Blackstone submitted a request to representatives of Qatalyst Partners to commence\ndiscussions with a limited group of potential equity co-investors.\nAlso on December 7, 2022, representatives of Blackstone, a representative of Qatalyst Partners and the Company\u2019s\nmanagement met in person to discuss Blackstone\u2019s continued interest in acquiring the Company. No terms of a\npotential transaction (including terms regarding rollover or other investment from any of the Company\u2019s\nstockholders, or the employment or service of Mr. Aggarwal or any other person with, or compensation to be paid by,\nBlackstone or any of its affiliates) were discussed.\nOn December 8, 2022, the Company\u2019s management gave an in-person Company overview presentation to\nrepresentatives of Blackstone, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance.\nBetween December 8, 2022 and January 19, 2023, Blackstone completed its preliminary diligence, which included\nmeetings with the Company\u2019s management and access to a virtual data room.\nOn December 9, 2022, representatives of Blackstone were granted access to a virtual data room.\nOn December 11, 2022, at the direction of Company management in consultation with members of the Transaction\nCommittee, Blackstone was granted permission to engage with two potential equity co-investors.\nOn December 12, 2022, the Company and Qatalyst Partners executed an engagement letter for Qatalyst Partners to\nserve as the Company\u2019s financial advisor in connection with a potential transaction.\nOn December 15, 2022, Party A submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest to the Board, based upon\npublicly available information, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $8.00-\n$8.25 per share (the \u201cRevised Party A Proposal\u201d), in cash, representing a 40%-44% premium to the Company\u2019s closing\nshare price of $5.71 as of December 14, 2022. The Revised Party A Proposal did not contemplate terms regarding a\nrollover or other investment from any of the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Revised Party A Proposal indicated that\nbased upon certain assumptions regarding the availability of debt financing, Party A would need to find a partner to\nunderwrite approximately $1.1 billion of additional equity capital prior to the signing of definitive transaction\ndocuments. The Revised Party A Proposal was promptly distributed to the Board for review.\nLater on December 15, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with Mr. Frankola, members of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of\nQatalyst Partners updated the Transaction Committee on the process undertaken by the Company to date, including\ndevelopments with each of Blackstone and Party A regarding the November Proposal and the Revised Party A\nProposal, respectively. The Transaction Committee instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to continue\npermitting Blackstone to conduct due diligence to allow it to propose an improved price per share, and to inform\nParty A that while the Revised Party A Proposal was below the value range at which the Company would transact, it\nwould be allowed to access non-public information in order to complete its preliminary diligence and provide an\nimproved price per share.\nOn December 16, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal received an inbound inquiry from a financial sponsor (which we refer to herein\nas \u201cParty E\u201d) concerning potential interest in an acquisition of the Company. Party E indicated that it had heard\nrumors regarding a potential transaction. Party E\u2019s interest was discussed with the Company\u2019s management, the\nTransaction Committee, and representatives of Qatalyst Partners. The Transaction Committee determined that the\nengagement with Party E was not warranted based on the lack of specifics included in its stated interest in a potential\ntransaction involving the Company and the fact that its fund size would likely not support an acquisition of the\nCompany at an attractive valuation. Party E did not submit a proposal to acquire the Company or otherwise follow up\nor further pursue any engagement with the Company regarding a potential transaction.\nOn December 18, 2022, the Company and Party A entered into a confidentiality agreement. The confidentiality\nagreement includes customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that prohibited Party\nA (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to acquire or acquiring the Company, and from\ntaking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies and making any request to amend, waive or terminate the\nstandstill provision, in each case, without the prior consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted\nParty A to make acquisition proposals at any time after the Company entered into a definitive agreement with a third\nparty\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nproviding for a change of control transaction of the Company. The confidentiality agreement also prohibited Party A\nfrom entering into any exclusivity or lock-up arrangement with any financing source. The Company did not approve\nany such exclusivity or lock-up arrangements for financing sources for Party A. This agreement also prohibited Party\nA from having discussions with the Company\u2019s management team regarding an equity rollover or any post-\ntransaction employment or compensation matters without the prior written consent of the Board. Following execution\nof the confidentiality agreement, Party A was provided access to due diligence information in the virtual data room.\nOn December 19, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners received an inbound inquiry from a financial sponsor\n(which we refer to herein as \u201cParty F\u201d) indicating that Party F had heard rumors regarding a potential transaction.\nRepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners relayed news of the inbound inquiry to Mr. Saroya. Following consultation with\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners, the Transaction Committee determined that engagement with Party F was not\nwarranted based on its fund size not being able to support an acquisition of the Company at an attractive valuation,\nits indication that it would not be able to lead any potential transaction of the Company, and the lack of specifics\nconcerning its interest in a potential transaction involving the Company.\nOn December 21, 2022, Party C contacted Mr. Saroya and indicated that, on a preliminary basis and based upon\npublicly available information, it was valuing the common stock of the Company at a price of approximately $6.50 per\nshare. As previously determined by the Board, Mr. Saroya communicated to Party C that the indicated price was\ninsufficient and that if it wanted to continue in discussions with the Company regarding a potential acquisition it\nwould need to meaningfully improve its price. Party C did not follow up on this conversation.\nOn December 21 and 23, 2022, the Company\u2019s management gave a presentation to representatives of Party A\nregarding the Company, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance.\nOn December 29, 2022, representatives of Blackstone and Mr. Aggarwal had an in-person meeting to discuss\nBlackstone\u2019s continued interest in acquiring the Company, the Company\u2019s business and the December Projections.\nNo terms of a potential transaction (including terms regarding rollover or other investment from any of the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders or the employment or service of Mr. Aggarwal or any other person with, or compensation to\nbe paid by, Blackstone or any of its affiliates) were discussed.\nOn December 30, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners received an inbound inquiry from a financial sponsor\n(which we refer to herein as \u201cParty G\u201d) who had indicated that it had heard rumors regarding a potential transaction\nand wished to relay its potential interest in a possible acquisition of the Company.\nOn December 31, 2022, representatives of Party G informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that Party G intended\nto submit a formal indication of interest with respect to a potential acquisition of the Company.\nOn January 4, 2023, Party G submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the Board, based upon publicly\navailable information, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $10.00 per share\n(the \u201cParty G Proposal\u201d), in cash, representing an 87% premium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $5.34 as of\nJanuary 3, 2023. The Party G Proposal did not contemplate terms regarding a rollover or other investment from any of\nthe Company\u2019s stockholders. Party G also indicated that it would not need a partner to complete a potential\ntransaction. The Party G Proposal was promptly distributed to the Board for review.\nOn January 6, 2023, the Company\u2019s management circulated to the Board the January Projections (as defined below in\nthe section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Certain Financial Projections\u201d), which expanded the\nDecember Projections to include financial forecasts, including an estimate of free cash flows, through calendar year\n2028, and the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled\n\u201cThe Merger - Certain Financial Projections\u201d), which included a free cash flow projection for each quarter of fiscal\nyear 2023. The January Projections were approved by the Board for use by Qatalyst Partners for purposes of\nproviding financial analyses in connection with the Board\u2019s evaluation of any potential strategic transaction and the\nSupplemental Free Cash Flow Projections were approved by the Board and subsequently shared with Blackstone\n(but no other potential bidders) in response to a diligence request from Blackstone for such information. For\nadditional information with respect to the January Projections and the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections, see\nthe section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Certain Financial Projections.\u201d\nAlso on January 6, 2023, the Company and Party G entered into a confidentiality agreement. The confidentiality\nagreement includes customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that prohibited Party\nG (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to acquire or acquiring the Company, and from\ntaking\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncertain other actions, including soliciting proxies and making any request to amend, waive or terminate the standstill\nprovision, in each case, without the prior consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted Party G to\nmake acquisition proposals at any time after the Company entered into a definitive agreement with a third party\nproviding for a change of control transaction of the Company. The confidentiality agreement also prohibited Party G\nfrom entering into any exclusivity or lock-up arrangement with any financing source. This agreement also prohibited\nParty G from having discussions with the Company\u2019s management team regarding an equity rollover or any post-\ntransaction employment or compensation matters without the prior written consent of the Board. The Company did\nnot approve any such exclusivity or lock-up arrangements for financing sources for Party G. Following execution of\nthe confidentiality agreement, Party G was provided access to due diligence information in the virtual data room on\nJanuary 9, 2023.\nOn January 7, 2023, representatives of Blackstone and Mr. Aggarwal, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners in\nattendance, had a meeting to discuss Blackstone\u2019s continued interest in acquiring the Company and certain of\nBlackstone\u2019s diligence findings to date regarding opportunities for operational improvements at the Company. No\nterms of a potential transaction (including terms regarding rollover or other investment from any of the Company\u2019s\nstockholders, or the employment or service of Mr. Aggarwal or any other person with, or compensation to be paid by,\nBlackstone or any of its affiliates) were discussed.\nOn January 18 and 20, 2023, the Company\u2019s management gave presentations to representatives of Party G regarding\nthe Company, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance.\nOn January 18, 2023, representatives of a financial sponsor (which we refer to herein as \u201cParty H\u201d) contacted the\nCompany\u2019s management concerning Party H\u2019s potential interest in the event management space generally, as well as\na potential transaction with the Company.\nOn January 19, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Party H and indicated that if it\nhad interest in a potential transaction involving the Company, it should submit a proposal based on public\ninformation. Representatives of Party H informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that Party H would consider\nwhether this was an opportunity it wanted to pursue. No further communication was received from Party H following\nsuch discussion.\nAlso on January 19, 2023, representatives of Blackstone contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to indicate\nthat its business diligence was substantially complete and that it remained interested in a potential acquisition of the\nCompany. The Blackstone representatives noted that both of the potential equity co-investors with whom Blackstone\nhad been permitted to engage had determined not to proceed, and it had not been permitted to contact debt financing\nsources (except for the limited group affiliated with Blackstone as previously approved by the Board). Blackstone\nrequested permission to move forward with confirmatory due diligence, and for permission to contact additional debt\nand equity financing sources and indicated that Blackstone could complete confirmatory diligence in three to four\nweeks. Blackstone indicated that this would allow it to put forward its best view on value and that it understood the\nCompany\u2019s expectation that any proposal would be above the high end of its previously indicated range.\nOn January 20, 2023, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with Mr. Frankola, members of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, the Transaction\nCommittee discussed the indications of interest received by the Company to date, that Blackstone had shown the\nmost engagement in a potential acquisition of the Company and that other bidders generally appeared to lack similar\nconviction and interest in the underlying business of the Company. The Transaction Committee discussed\nBlackstone\u2019s request to engage with additional potential equity and debt financing sources, including that providing\nBlackstone with an ability to engage with additional financing sources could facilitate Blackstone\u2019s ability to submit a\nbid that was at a compelling value and approved Blackstone\u2019s engagement of a limited list of additional potential debt\nand equity financing sources. The Transaction Committee also discussed the Party G Proposal, including the fact that\nthe Party G Proposal would represent a large portion of Party G\u2019s available funds, and, as a result, concerns that the\nParty G Proposal was not a viable offer, but given Party G\u2019s initial value indication, the Company had entered into a\nconfidentiality agreement with Party G and provided representatives of Party G with diligence information and a\nmanagement presentation. Representatives of Kirkland discussed the status and key terms of an initial auction draft\nof the Merger Agreement, and the Transaction Committee instructed representatives of Kirkland to deliver a draft of\nthe Merger Agreement to Blackstone\u2019s and any other remaining participant\u2019s outside legal advisor at the appropriate\ntime.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn January 24, 2023, representatives of Party G communicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners Party G\u2019s\ninability to further proceed in a potential acquisition of the Company, noting that Party G had determined that it had\noverestimated the opportunity for operational improvements to the Company.\nOn January 29, 2023, at the request of the Transaction Committee, representatives of Kirkland delivered to\nrepresentatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (\u201cSimpson Thacher\u201d), Blackstone\u2019s outside legal advisor, a draft\nof the Merger Agreement.\nOn January 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s management gave a presentation to representatives of Party A regarding the\nCompany\u2019s sales organization and go-to-market strategy, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance.\nOn January 31, 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Company was exploring a potential sale, identifying\nBlackstone as a potential bidder (the \u201cWSJ Article\u201d).\nFollowing the publication of the WSJ Article, on January 31, 2023 and February 1, 2023, Mr. Aggarwal received\ninbound communications from representatives of two different venture capital and equity investment firms (which we\nrefer to herein as \u201cParty I\u201d and \u201cParty J\u201d). The email from Party I requested a brief introductory call with Mr. Aggarwal\nto establish a relationship but did not indicate that Party I was interested in pursuing, or capable of completing, a\npotential acquisition of the Company. Mr. Aggarwal and the representative of Party I did not have an introductory\ncall and the representative of Party I did not contact Mr. Aggarwal or the Company again following such initial\noutreach. The representative of Party J referenced the WSJ Article to Mr. Aggarwal and noted that, while Party J did\nnot have the financial capacity to acquire the Company, Party J would potentially be interested in participating as an\nadditional equity financing source in an acquisition of the Company by a third party. Mr. Aggarwal noted the\ninbound communications from Party I and Party J to the Chairman of the Board.\nOn February 1, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners received an inbound inquiry from representatives of a\nfinancial sponsor (which we refer to herein as \u201cParty K\u201d), who expressed an interest in acquiring the Company and a\ndesire to move quickly. After discussions with and obtaining approval from members of the Transaction Committee,\nand in light of the view that Party K was a highly credible bidder based on its ability to move quickly, its fund size\nand its strong track record of consummating transactions in the industry, Qatalyst Partners offered to provide Party K\nwith preliminary due diligence information, subject to the execution of a confidentiality agreement.\nAlso on February 1, 2023, at the direction of the members of the Transaction Committee, representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners requested that Blackstone provide a final proposal on value on February 17, 2023, including a Merger\nAgreement in a form that it would be prepared to execute as well as executable equity and debt commitment letters.\nQatalyst noted that Kirkland would be available to engage with Simpson Thacher in advance of this date.\nAlso on February 1, 2023, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided Party A an\ninitial draft of the Merger Agreement via the virtual data room.\nOn February 3, 2023, the Company and Party K entered into a confidentiality agreement. The confidentiality\nagreement includes customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that prohibited Party\nK (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to acquire or acquiring the Company, and from\ntaking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies and making any request to amend, waive or terminate the\nstandstill provision, in each case, without the prior consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted\nParty K to make acquisition proposals at any time after the Company entered into a definitive agreement with a third\nparty providing for a change of control transaction of the Company. The confidentiality agreement also prohibited\nParty K from entering into any exclusivity or lock-up arrangement with any financing source. The Company did not\napprove any such exclusivity or lock-up arrangements for financing sources for Party K. This agreement also\nprohibited Party K from having discussions with the Company\u2019s management team regarding an equity rollover or\nany post-transaction employment or compensation matters without the prior written consent of the Board. Following\nexecution of the confidentiality agreement, Party K was provided access to select due diligence information in the\nvirtual data room on February 3, 2023.\nAlso on February 3, 2023, representatives of Blackstone and Mr. Aggarwal, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nin attendance, discussed Blackstone\u2019s continued interest in acquiring the Company, the diligence process undertaken\nby Blackstone to date, as well as its outreach to potential financing sources. No terms regarding a rollover or other\ninvestment from any of the Company\u2019s stockholders, or the employment or service of Mr. Aggarwal or any other\nperson with, or compensation to be paid by, Blackstone or any of its affiliates were discussed.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on February 3, 2023, a representative of Party A reached out to a representative of Qatalyst Partners and\nindicated that Party A remained interested in a potential transaction but, based on its business due diligence to date,\nthat it would be unable to improve the purchase price set forth in the Revised Party A Proposal, and that, in any case,\nit would require a partner to be able to complete an acquisition of the Company.

This request was discussed with\nmanagement of the Company and the Transaction Committee and denied the following day, taking into account,\namong other things, the fact that (1) Party A had indicated that, based on its business due diligence to date, it would\nnot be able to improve upon the purchase price set forth in the Revised Party A Proposal (which was below the high\nend of the valuation range in Blackstone\u2019s November Proposal), (2) Blackstone had already substantially completed\nconfirmatory diligence and acknowledged the Company\u2019s expectation that any potential revised proposal it submitted\nwould need to be above the high end of the valuation range in its November Proposal, and (3) Blackstone had not\nrequested to partner with a co-bidder in the transaction.\nOn February 11, 2023, representatives of Party K indicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that Party K was no\nlonger interested in pursuing an acquisition of the Company.\nOn February 12, 2023, the Company\u2019s management circulated to the Board the Updated Free Cash Flow Projections\n(as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Certain Financial Projections\u201d), which\nreflected updates to the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections and the February Projections (as defined below in\nthe section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Certain Financial Projections\u201d), which reflected updates to\nthe January Projections, in each case, to reflect refined assumptions with respect to projected cash taxes and the\nimpact of such refined assumptions on the Company and its free cash flow (for additional information with respect to\nthe Updated Free Cash Flow Projections and the February Projections, see the section of this proxy statement titled\n\u201cThe Merger - Certain Financial Projections\u201d).

Blackstone confirmed that it understood the expectation to\ndeliver a fully-financed offer with a revised Merger Agreement as previously had been communicated by\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners, and Blackstone did not request any rollover from any existing Company\nstockholders.\nOn February 17, 2023, representatives of Blackstone informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Mr. Aggarwal\nthat Blackstone\u2019s Investment Committee was reviewing the terms of a potential acquisition of the Company.\nAlso on February 17, 2023, representatives of Blackstone had a call with Mr. Aggarwal and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners to discuss certain diligence questions of Blackstone to prepare for the call scheduled for February\n19, 2023.\nOn February 19, 2023, representatives of Blackstone, including certain members of Blackstone\u2019s Investment\nCommittee, and Mr. Aggarwal, with a representative of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, discussed the Company\u2019s\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfinancial projections and its ability to deliver operational improvement. No terms regarding a rollover or other\ninvestment from any Company stockholder, or the employment or service of Mr. Aggarwal or any other person with,\nor compensation to be paid by, Blackstone or any of its affiliates, were discussed.\nOn February 21, 2023, Blackstone submitted a \u201cbest and final\u201d non-binding indication of interest to the Board to\nacquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $8.00 per share (the \u201cFebruary 21\nProposal\u201d), representing a 22% premium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $6.57 as of January 30, 2023, the last\ntrading day before the WSJ Article regarding a potential sale of the Company (the \u201cJanuary 30 Price\u201d), together with\nrevised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Company disclosure letter, as well as initial drafts of the Equity\nCommitment Letter, Limited Guarantee and a Debt Commitment Letter that contemplated debt financing of $900\nmillion. The February 21 Proposal stated that the $8.00 per share price was a 54% premium to the closing share price\nof $5.21 as of January 6, 2023, the last trading day prior to a decoupling of the Company\u2019s trading patterns in advance\nof the WSJ Article observed by Blackstone. The February 21 Proposal was contingent on the Vista Stockholders\n\u201crolling\u201d a portion of the shares of Company common stock owned by them, valued at $1.0 billion (based on the $8.00\nper share price in the February 21 Proposal) into common equity of the post-closing company in connection with a\npotential sale of the Company, in order to address a gap in the requisite financing (due to equity financing sources\ndeciding they were not interested in proceeding with the transaction) for Blackstone to make an offer for the\nCompany at a value that Blackstone believed would be of interest to the Board. The February 21 Proposal further\ncontemplated that Blackstone and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (\u201cADIA\u201d)\nwould provide a common equity and convertible preferred equity investment, which would be senior to Vista\u2019s\n\u201crolled\u201d equity, to help finance the acquisition of the Company. The February 21 Proposal also included a request to\ninitiate discussions regarding potential rollovers and other post-closing arrangements with certain members of the\nCompany\u2019s management, subject to approval by an independent special committee of the Board of non-management\ndirectors that are independent of Vista. The February 21 Proposal was promptly distributed to the Board for review.\nAlso on February 21, 2023, Qatalyst Partners delivered an updated relationship disclosure letter to the Board.\nOn February 22, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Blackstone discussed the terms of the February 21\nProposal, and representatives of Qatalyst Partners conveyed that the price was lower than had been expected and\nthat the request for a rollover from the Vista Stockholders to bridge a financing gap was a new and unexpected\nrequest based on Blackstone\u2019s previously conveyed expectations that sufficient financing would be available.\nRepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners conveyed that the February 21 Proposal would be discussed with the Board\nbut, based on prior Board direction, was unlikely to result in any further engagement or a counterproposal.\nOn February 23, 2023, representatives of Blackstone orally submitted a revised proposal to representatives of\nQatalyst Partners to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $8.10 per share (the\n\u201cFebruary 23 Proposal\u201d), representing a 23% premium to the January 30 Price, contingent on the Vista Stockholders\n\u201crolling\u201d a portion of the shares of Company common stock owned by them into common equity of the post-closing\ncompany, valued at $1.0 billion (based on the $8.10 per share price in the February 23 Proposal). The February 23\nProposal no longer contemplated a convertible preferred equity investment from Blackstone and a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of ADIA that would be senior to Vista\u2019s \u201crolled\u201d equity. The February 23 Proposal was promptly\ndistributed to the Board for review.\nOn February 24, 2023, Reuters reported that the Company had rejected a $3.9 billion acquisition offer from Blackstone.\nOn February 27, 2023, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance.

At such meeting,\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed the February 23 Proposal from a financial point of view.\nRepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the current state of the financial markets, including current market\nvaluation for similar companies, market volatility, high interest rates, constraints around availability of financing, and\ninflationary pressures. The Board also discussed market conditions generally, including a potential recession and\npossible macroeconomic challenges facing the Company.\nAt the meeting, the Board also discussed the fact that the February 23 Proposal was contingent on the Vista\nStockholders \u201crolling\u201d a portion of the shares of Company common stock owned by them into common equity of the\npost-closing company. Mr. Saroya reiterated that Vista\u2019s preference was to sell all of its shares of Company\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncommon stock for cash. However, he noted that if a rollover by Vista of a portion of its shares of Company common\nstock could be leveraged to obtain a higher price for the benefit of all of the Company\u2019s stockholders, Vista was\nwilling to entertain a discussion of a partial rollover. Mr. Saroya noted that, at this point in time, Vista\u2019s interest was\naligned with the Company\u2019s other stockholders, which was to maximize value for all stockholders. Representatives of\nKirkland discussed with the Board its fiduciary duties and the potential benefits of creating a special committee if the\nBoard determined to proceed with a proposal that involved a potential rollover by Vista. After discussion, the Board\ndetermined, with Vista\u2019s support, to submit a counteroffer at $9.00 per share, with Vista agreeing to reinvest $1.0\nbillion of its shares into a non-convertible preferred equity instrument with market terms to be separately negotiated\nbetween Vista and Blackstone. The Board determined that if Blackstone accepted the Company\u2019s offer, it would\nestablish a special committee of independent directors to evaluate the terms of any potential transaction in light of a\nreinvestment by Vista or the Vista Stockholders. After the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners conveyed the\nBoard-directed message to representatives of Blackstone. The Board also reviewed Qatalyst Partners\u2019 updated\nrelationship disclosure letter and determined that, based on the letter, it continued to believe that Qatalyst Partners\ndid not have any conflicts that would affect the ability of Qatalyst Partners to fulfill its responsibilities as financial\nadvisor to the Board.\nImmediately following the completion of the Board meeting, representatives of Kirkland met with Mr. Frankola and\nMs. Martin, the members of the Board who were independent and disinterested relative to Vista, Blackstone and the\nCompany\u2019s management, to discuss process generally and certain potential procedural safeguards, including\npotentially creating a special committee of independent and disinterested members of the Board, that could be taken\nby the independent and disinterested members of the Board in the context of a potential rollover by Vista, and\nprovided an overview of the Board\u2019s (including the independent directors\u2019) fiduciary duties in the context of a\npotential transaction.\nOn March 1, 2023, a representative of Party A contacted a representative of Qatalyst Partners with ongoing interest\nbut reaffirmed that its previously communicated constraints regarding price and ability to consummate a transaction\non its own remained unchanged. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners relayed this interaction to the Transaction\nCommittee and noted that (1) Party A stated that, based on its business due diligence, it was unable to improve the\n$8.00-$8.25 per share purchase price set forth in the Revised Party A Proposal, and (2) Party A had not engaged in\nother steps necessary to consummate a transaction, including, among other things, requesting access to begin\nconfirmatory diligence and providing any comments to the draft Merger Agreement. Based on these considerations,\nthe Transaction Committee determined that engagement with Party A was not warranted.\nOn March 4, 2023, representatives of Blackstone orally submitted a proposal to representatives of Qatalyst Partners\n(the \u201cMarch 4 Proposal\u201d), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for either (a)\n$8.20 per share, representing a 25% premium to the January 30 Price, contingent on the Vista Stockholders \u201crolling\u201d a\nportion of the shares of Company common stock owned by them into common equity of the post-closing company,\nvalued at at least $1.0 billion, with Blackstone noting that it would be open to a larger rollover that would result in\nVista and Blackstone each owning an equal stake of the combined company, or (b) $8.50 per share, representing a\n29% premium to the January 30 Price, contingent on the Vista Stockholders investing $1.25 billion of the proceeds\nreceived from shares of Company common stock owned by them as non-convertible preferred equity of the post-\nclosing company at an approximately 10.0% payment-in-kind interest rate (as described in clause (b), the \u201cVista\nPreferred Financing\u201d), which was viewed by Blackstone as a below-market rate for such a security. Representatives of\nBlackstone also orally indicated that if the Company was willing to agree to a delayed close until the end of\nNovember to facilitate a 45-day marketing period commencing after the third quarter of 2023, based on the third\nquarter results of the Company, Blackstone would be potentially willing to increase its price per share offered in either\nclause (a) or (b) above by $0.15 to $0.20 or if no other proposal was acceptable, Blackstone would consider\nalternative transaction structures, including investing in the Company through a PIPE and having the Company\nconduct a self-tender offer with the proceeds.\nAlso on March 4, 2023, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed the terms of the March 4\nProposal. Mr. Stahl informed the Board that, although Vista\u2019s preference was to sell all of its shares for cash, it was\nwilling to consider providing the non-convertible preferred financing in order to obtain a higher per share price for\nthe benefit of all common stockholders, even though it viewed the interest rate proposed by Blackstone as\nsignificantly below market. At the meeting, the Board discussed the March 4 Proposal, including the terms of the\nVista Preferred Financing, and determined to submit a counterproposal to Blackstone of $8.75 per share,\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncontemplating that the Vista Stockholders would \u201croll\u201d a portion of the shares of Company common stock owned by\nthem into non-convertible preferred equity of the post-closing company, valued at $1.25 billion (based on such $8.75\nper share price), consistent with the Vista Preferred Financing construct. Vista informed the Board that it would be\nwilling to consider providing the Vista Preferred Financing, subject to the negotiation of acceptable terms to Vista,\nand the eventual approval of an independent special committee of the Board, including a higher payment-in-kind\ninterest rate, and indicated that 13.5% payment-in-kind interest rate would be acceptable. Following such indication\nfrom Vista, the Board determined to include in the counterproposal to Blackstone discussed above the Vista Preferred\nFinancing with a payment-in-kind interest rate of 13.5%. The Board also discussed Blackstone\u2019s proposed alternative\ntransaction structures and delayed closing timing and determined that the Board\u2019s counterproposal to the March 4\nProposal would provide the most deal certainty for the Company\u2019s stockholders. After the meeting, representatives\nof Qatalyst Partners conveyed the Board-directed message to representatives of Blackstone.\nBetween March 4 and 6, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners, at the direction of the Board, discussed with\nrepresentatives of Blackstone the terms of the March 4 Proposal as well as the Board\u2019s counterproposal. Blackstone\nnoted that, with respect to the Vista Preferred Financing, it would not be able to provide a payment-in-kind interest\nrate higher than 10.5% per annum and that, other than the increase in the payment-in-kind interest rate from 10.0% to\n10.5% per annum, the terms set forth in the March 4 Proposal represented Blackstone\u2019s \u201cbest and final\u201d proposal.\nOn March 6, 2023, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, Qatalyst Partners updated the Board on the\ndiscussions with Blackstone after the previous meeting, including Blackstone\u2019s position that the March 4 Proposal\nwas its \u201cbest and final\u201d and that it would not be willing to provide a payment-in-kind interest rate on the Vista\nPreferred Financing higher than 10.5% per annum. The Board discussed the March 4 Proposal, including the terms of\nthe Vista Preferred Financing. During the Board\u2019s discussion, Mr. Stahl indicated that Vista would be willing to\nconsider proceeding with a transaction structure that included the Vista Preferred Financing, even though Vista\nbelieved that the interest rate of up to 10.5% offered by Blackstone was below market. At the meeting, Vista indicated\nit was supportive of a transaction at $8.50 per share and stated that if the Board determined to move forward on these\nterms, it would be prepared to engage with Blackstone to negotiate terms of a preferred instrument in order to\nfacilitate a transaction (at the interest rate proposed). After discussion, the Board determined to proceed with\ndiscussions relating to Blackstone\u2019s offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company\nfor $8.50 per share, representing a 29% premium to the January 30 Price, contingent on the Vista Stockholders\ninvesting $1.25 billion of the proceeds received from shares of Company common stock owned by them as non-\nconvertible preferred equity of the post-closing company at a 10.5% per annum payment-in-kind interest rate. The\nBoard did not assess whether the Vista Preferred Financing was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Vista\nStockholders.\nAt the same meeting, the Board determined to form the Special Committee to (a) review and evaluate a potential sale\nof the Company, including the Vista Preferred Financing, (b) make such investigation of a potential sale of the\nCompany and any alternatives thereto (including remaining an independent company) as it, in its sole discretion,\ndeems advisable or appropriate, (c) if the Special Committee considers it advisable or appropriate, review and provide\ninput with respect to the price, structure, form, terms and conditions of a potential sale of the Company or any\nalternative thereto and the form, terms and conditions of any definitive agreements in connection therewith, (d)\ndetermine whether a potential sale of the Company or any alternative thereto is advisable and fair to and in the best\ninterests of the Company and its stockholders, (e) obtain any necessary or desirable advice, assistance and opinions\nfrom financial advisors, legal counsel or other advisors, consultants and agents, (f) recommend to the full Board what\naction, if any, should be taken by the Company with respect to a potential sale of the Company that includes or\ncontemplates the Vista Preferred Financing, and (g) provide reports or recommendations to the Board in regard to a\npotential sale of the Company at such times as the Special Committee deems appropriate and consistent with its\nactivities. The Board also determined that (i) the Special Committee would not have the power to cause the Company\nto enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, definitive agreement to effect, or other agreement\nbinding or committing the Company to the terms of a potential sale of the Company or any alternative thereto, which\npowers and authority remained vested exclusively in the Board, and (ii) the Board would not approve or recommend a\npotential transaction that involved the Vista Preferred Financing without a prior favorable recommendation of the\nSpecial Committee. After discussion at the meeting, the Board determined that each of Mr. Frankola and Ms. Martin\nwere independent and disinterested for purposes of a possible sale of the Company, including in the case of a\ntransaction including the Vista Preferred Financing, and appointed them to the Special Committee.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nImmediately following the completion of the Board meeting, the Special Committee held a meeting with\nrepresentatives of Kirkland in attendance to discuss the retention of independent legal and financial advisors to\nadvise the Special Committee. The Special Committee determined to contact Goodwin Procter LLP (\u201cGoodwin\u201d) to\ndetermine whether Goodwin was available to serve as the Special Committee\u2019s independent legal advisor, on the basis\nof Goodwin\u2019s extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates and experience advising\nsoftware and technology companies in connection with potential strategic transactions.\nBeginning on March 6, 2023 until the signing of the Merger Agreement, and with the approval of the Special\nCommittee at the meeting on March 7, 2023, representatives of Blackstone and representatives of Vista negotiated the\nterms of the Vista Preferred Financing.\nAlso on March 6, 2023, representatives of Kirkland delivered to representatives of Simpson Thacher initial drafts of\nthe Preferred Term Sheet in connection with the Vista Preferred Financing and the Voting Agreement for the Vista\nStockholders as requested by Blackstone. The draft Preferred Term Sheet delivered by representatives of Kirkland\ncontemplated, among other terms, an initial 10.5% payment-in-kind interest, which rate would be increased by 1.0\npercentage point per annum beginning on the fifth anniversary of the closing date and 2.0 percentage points per\nannum beginning on the tenth anniversary of the closing date or upon the occurrence of certain noncompliance\nevents. The draft Preferred Term Sheet also contemplated that the issuer would be required to repurchase the\npreferred shares for cash in the case of certain mandatory redemption events and that the holders of the preferred\nshares would be entitled to designate one member to the issuer\u2019s board of directors.\nBetween March 6, 2023 and March 14, 2023, representatives of Kirkland and Simpson Thacher exchanged drafts and\nnegotiated the terms of the Preferred Term Sheet and the Voting Agreement for the Vista Stockholders, and conducted\na number of conference calls regarding the drafts of such agreements. Among other items in the draft Preferred Term\nSheet, the parties negotiated circumstances in which the interest rate would be increased, optional and mandatory\nredemption rights (including, at the request of Blackstone, the right of the issuer to elect to repurchase the preferred\nshares for equity in the case of certain mandatory redemption events), transferability of the preferred shares, consent,\nboard, exit-demand and registration rights. The final Preferred Term Sheet negotiated by the parties reflected the\nfollowing terms: (a) an initial 10.5% payment-in-kind interest rate, which rate will increase by 0.75% per annum\nbeginning on the eighth anniversary of the closing date, subject to a maximum rate of 15.0% per annum (the\n\u201cMaximum Rate\u201d)\u037e (b) the right of the issuer to redeem the preferred shares prior to the second anniversary of the\nclosing date, for cash at a make-whole redemption price, or on and after the second anniversary of the closing date,\nbased on the redemption prices set forth in the Preferred Commitment Letter, decreasing ratably to par for any\nredemption occurring after the fourth anniversary of the closing date\u037e (c) the right of the holders of the preferred\nshares, upon the occurrence of certain change of control events or upon an initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) (each, a\n\u201cMandatory Redemption Event\u201d), to require the issuer to repurchase the preferred shares at the applicable\nredemption price for cash, or in certain circumstances and at the election of the issuer, an equivalent number of\nshares of the acquiring company or shares of the publicly traded entity listed in such IPO\u037e (d) in the case of a\nMandatory Redemption Event in which the holders of common stock of the issuer would achieve a gross internal rate\nof return (\u201cIRR\u201d) of 20% or greater, the obligation of the issuer to make a \u201ccatch up\u201d payment to each holder of\npreferred shares in an amount equal to (x) the amount of dividends that would have accrued on the preferred shares\nassuming an initial interest rate of 12.5% minus (y) any make-whole amount or redemption premium to be paid to a\nholder of a preferred share in connection with such Mandatory Redemption Event (which \u201ccatch up\u201d payment is\nsubject to reduction to the extent necessary to cause the IRR to not be less than 20% after giving effect to such\npayment)\u037e (e) beginning on the tenth anniversary of the closing date, the right of the holders of a majority of the\noutstanding preferred shares to demand the issuer to engage in a process to effect either an IPO or a sale of the\nissuer (if the issuer fails to consummate such an IPO or sale within twelve months of a demand, then the dividend rate\nwill increase by 1.0 percentage point per annum, subject to the Maximum Rate)\u037e (f) certain consent rights of the\nholders of the preferred shares over, among other things, the incurrence of indebtedness, the making of restricted\npayments and transactions with affiliates\u037e and (g) the right of the Vista Stockholders to designate one non-voting\nobserver to the issuer\u2019s board of directors so long as they own at least 30% of the preferred shares outstanding at\nsuch time.\nOn March 7, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting. Members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Kirkland also attended portions of the meeting, and representatives of Goodwin attended the\nmeeting. Representatives of Goodwin noted that, prior to this meeting, Goodwin received confirmations from both of\nthe members of the Special Committee that neither had any disabling conflicts of interest with respect to the\nCompany or any of its subsidiaries, or with Vista or Blackstone or any of their respective affiliates (including their\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrespective portfolio companies). Representatives of Kirkland then summarized the material aspects of the Preferred\nTerm Sheet in connection with the Vista Preferred Financing, noting that the parties largely modelled the economic\nand covenant terms of the Vista Preferred Financing from prevailing market terms for third-party debt financing in a\nleveraged buyout. Representatives of Goodwin then discussed the Special Committee\u2019s fiduciary duties under\nDelaware law in connection with the review of the potential transaction involving Blackstone and involving the Vista\nPreferred Financing. Representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland then discussed Blackstone\u2019s request to initiate\ndiscussions regarding potential rollovers and other post-closing arrangements with certain members of the\nCompany\u2019s management. Following such discussion, and in light of the key terms of the potential transaction,\nincluding the maximum price that Blackstone would be willing to pay, having been finalized, the members of the\nSpecial Committee authorized high-level, non-binding discussions to occur, with more detailed discussions, including\nas to negotiation of binding rollover agreements, to be deferred until the Special Committee provided further\napprovals at a later time. In executive session, with representatives of Kirkland having left the meeting and\nrepresentatives of Goodwin still in attendance, the Special Committee also discussed the potential engagement of J.P.\nMorgan to advise the Special Committee with respect to a potential transaction. The Special Committee noted J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s extensive expertise, qualifications, knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates, and\nexperience representing special committees. Following such discussion, the Special Committee authorized Goodwin\nto negotiate terms of an engagement letter with representatives of J.P. Morgan and procure J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nrelationships disclosure with respect to the potential transaction. Representatives of Goodwin then provided a\nsummary of the current legal terms of the Vista Preferred Financing and also noted that they expected Blackstone to\nfurther negotiate the terms contained in Vista\u2019s initial draft Preferred Term Sheet in favor of Blackstone.\nAlso on March 7, 2023, representatives of Kirkland delivered to representatives of Simpson Thacher a revised draft of\nthe Merger Agreement and ancillary transaction documents. Between March 7, 2023 and March 14, 2023,\nrepresentatives of Kirkland and Simpson Thacher, on behalf of the Company and Blackstone, respectively, exchanged\ndrafts of the Merger Agreement and ancillary transaction documents, and conducted a number of conference calls\nregarding the draft Merger Agreement and ancillary transaction documents. Among other items in the draft Merger\nAgreement, the parties negotiated the termination fees to be payable by the Company and Blackstone, regulatory\nefforts, the treatment of equity awards, the inclusion of a go-shop covenant, the terms of the no-shop covenant, caps\non the parties\u2019 liability, closing timing and the conditions to the Merger. Representatives of Kirkland delivered such\ndrafts of the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents to representatives of Goodwin for its review and\ncomment, which, in turn shared such documents with the Special Committee promptly as received.\nOn March 8, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland also\nattended portions of the meeting and representatives of Goodwin attended the meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners reviewed with the Special Committee the outreach process undertaken by the Company to date and the\nstatus of discussions with the parties that had indicated an interest in a potential acquisition of the Company,\nincluding (x) the discussions with Blackstone and the terms of the Vista Preferred Financing and (y) that (1) Party A\nstated that it would be unable to improve the purchase price set forth in the Revised Party A Proposal, (2) Party A\nstated that it required partnership with other equity financing sources, and (3) Party A had not engaged in other\nsteps necessary to consummate a transaction, including, among other things, requesting access to begin\nconfirmatory diligence and providing any comments to the draft Merger Agreement. By comparison, Blackstone had\ncompleted confirmatory diligence and substantially completed the negotiation of the draft Merger Agreement. The\nSpecial Committee discussed the terms of the Vista Preferred Financing. The Special Committee also discussed the\noutreach process undertaken by the Company to date and whether based on such process and in light of the Vista\nPreferred Financing, any further outreach to additional potential bidders or to prior bidders, including to offer\nfinancing terms similar to the Vista Preferred Financing, would present a reasonable likelihood of producing a\nproposal that is superior to the March 4 Proposal. Following discussion, the Special Committee determined that it\nwould further assess such matters, including the Vista Preferred Financing, before deciding on any further outreach.\nOn March 9, 2023, Qatalyst Partners delivered an updated relationship disclosure letter to the Board.\nAlso on March 9, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners received an inbound inquiry from a financial sponsor\n(which we refer to herein as \u201cParty L\u201d) concerning its potential interest in an acquisition of the Company and relayed\nthis inquiry to the Board.\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on March 9, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also attended portions\nof the meeting and representatives of Goodwin attended the meeting. Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed its\npreliminary analysis of the Vista Preferred Financing terms and hypothetical third party financings in the current\nmarket.\nAlso on March 9, 2023, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. Members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners updated the Board with respect to the revised terms proposed by Blackstone and the negotiations\nthat had occurred over the past week. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed its financial analyses of the\nMarch 4 Proposal based on the February Projections (as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement\ntitled \u201cThe Merger - Certain Financial Projections\u201d). The Board also considered the inbound inquiry from Party L\nand given the amount of time that had elapsed following the WSJ Article and the presence of a fully negotiated and\ndiligenced proposal from Blackstone that was not subject to the completion of additional confirmatory diligence, the\nBoard chose not to respond to such inbound inquiry. Representatives of Kirkland discussed with the Board its\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with the potential transaction, as well as approaches for mitigating\nor neutralizing any conflicts of interest, including the formation of the Special Committee. Representatives of Kirkland\nsummarized the terms of the draft Merger Agreement, as well as the terms of the Preferred Term Sheet, including with\nrespect to redemption rights, transferability of equity, consent rights, registration rights and indemnification\nobligations, and other transaction documents, but the Board did not assess whether the Vista Preferred Financing\nwas advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Vista Stockholders. The Board discussed the price and other\nterms of the Merger Agreement and indicated its support for a transaction on those terms, subject to the prior\nfavorable recommendation of the Special Committee. The Board also reviewed Qatalyst Partners\u2019 updated relationship\ndisclosure letter and determined that based on the letter it continued to believe that Qatalyst Partners did not have\nany conflicts that would affect the ability of Qatalyst Partners to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to the\nBoard.\nAlso on March 9, 2023, J.P. Morgan provided the Special Committee with customary relationship disclosures\nregarding J.P. Morgan\u2019s relationships with Blackstone and Vista.\nAlso on March 9, 2023, representatives of Kirkland delivered to representatives of Simpson Thacher revised drafts of\nthe Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee. Between March 9, 2023 and March 14, 2023, representatives\nof Kirkland and Simpson Thacher, on behalf of the Company and Blackstone, respectively, exchanged drafts of the\nEquity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee, and conducted a number of conference calls regarding the\ndrafts of such agreements. Representatives of Kirkland delivered such drafts to representatives of Goodwin for its\nreview and comment.\nLater on March 9, 2023, the Special Committee held another meeting with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goodwin\npresent. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed the February Projections and the December Projections. Following\ndiscussion, the Special Committee approved the February Projections and directed J.P. Morgan to use them for\npurposes of its financial analysis of the proposed transaction.\nOn March 10, 2023, the Company (on behalf of, and at the direction of, the Special Committee) and J.P. Morgan\nexecuted an engagement letter.\nAlso on March 10, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goodwin in\nattendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed its preliminary analysis of the Vista Preferred Financing terms\nand hypothetical third party financing terms in the current market. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also reviewed its\npreliminary financial analysis of the proposed Merger Consideration, and the Special Committee discussed this\npreliminary analysis. The Special Committee then discussed the likelihood that other bidders in the Company\u2019s sale\nprocess would have materially altered the terms of a potential transaction with the Company if such other bidders\nwere able to obtain financing on similar terms to the Vista Preferred Financing. After the Special Committee\u2019s\ndiscussion, the Special Committee determined that the March 4 Proposal was the best price reasonably available and\nthat contacting the prior bidders or additional potential bidders would be unlikely to result in a proposal that is\nsuperior to the current Blackstone proposal.\nAlso on March 10, 2023, representatives of Kirkland delivered to representatives of Simpson Thacher drafts of the\nPreferred Commitment Letter and the Voting Agreements for certain management members. Between March 10, 2023\nand March 14, 2023, representatives of Kirkland and Simpson Thacher, on behalf of the Company and\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBlackstone, respectively, exchanged drafts of the Preferred Commitment Letter and the Voting Agreements for certain\nmanagement members, and conducted a number of conference calls regarding the drafts of such agreements.\nRepresentatives of Kirkland delivered such drafts to representatives of Goodwin for its review and comment.\nAlso on March 10, 2023, representatives of Blackstone met telephonically with Mr. Aggarwal, with representatives of\nSimpson Thacher and Kirkland in attendance, to discuss members of senior management\u2019s receptiveness to a rollover\nof their investment in the Company as part of a potential transaction. Mr. Aggarwal confirmed that, subject to the\nnegotiation of definitive terms at a later date (if and as approved by the Special Committee), members of senior\nmanagement would be receptive to rolling over a material portion of their investment in the Company but no specific\nterms or amounts were discussed or agreed regarding such potential rollover.\nOn March 13, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting, with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goodwin present.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and Goodwin discussed the Vista Preferred Financing terms and hypothetical third\nparty financings in the current market. Following discussion and consideration of the transaction documents,\nincluding the Preferred Commitment Letter, the Special Committee, having considered the course of dealing among\nthe Company, Vista and Blackstone with respect to the Vista Preferred Financing, determined that the economic and\nlegal terms of the Vista Preferred Financing were not more favorable in the aggregate to Vista than as could be\nachieved in arm\u2019s-length similar transactions in the prevailing market. Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed\nits financial analysis of the proposed Merger Consideration and then formally delivered J.P. Morgan\u2019s oral opinion to\nthe Special Committee, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated as of March 14,\n2023, that as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its\nopinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Cvent common stock (other than (i) the holders of\nOwned Company Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii) the holders of Dissenting Company Shares (as\ndefined in the Merger Agreement), and (iii) the Vista Stockholders) in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial\npoint of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy statement\ntitled \u201cThe Merger - Opinion of J.P. Morgan.\u201d The Special Committee then adopted resolutions favorably\nrecommending the potential transaction with Blackstone and the Vista Preferred Financing to the Company Board\nafter consideration of the factors described in the section titled \u201cThe Merger - Reasons for the Merger\u037e\nRecommendation of the Special Committee and the Cvent Board.\u201d\nOn the evening of March 13, 2023, following the Special Committee meeting, the Board held a meeting with members\nof the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives\nof Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board its financial analyses of the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of\nCompany common stock in cash, without interest. At the conclusion of its presentation, Qatalyst Partners delivered\nto the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of March 13, 2023, and based\nupon and subject to the various qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters considered in the\npreparation thereof as set forth therein, the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of Company common stock in\ncash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger\nAgreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to such holders. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is more fully described in the section of this\nproxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Opinion of Qatalyst Partners.\u201d Representatives of Kirkland summarized the\nterms of the draft Merger Agreement and the Preferred Term Sheet.

Further, the members of the Board reviewed and approved the Voting\nAgreements, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Company disclosure letter and other\ntransaction documents, as well as the transactions contemplated by the Preferred Commitment Letter.\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn the morning of March 14, 2023, the Company and Blackstone executed the Merger Agreement and delivered an\nexecuted Voting Agreement for the Vista Stockholders, Voting Agreements for certain management members, the\nEquity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee and the Preferred Commitment Letter (including the Preferred Term\nSheet).

In the course of reaching its determination and\nmaking its recommendations, the Special Committee considered the following list of material factors, which are not\npresented in any relative order of importance and each of which the Special Committee viewed as being generally\nsupportive of its determination and recommendations to the Board:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the price per share of $8.50 in cash provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders other than the Vista Stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Company common\nstock, including the fact that $8.50 per share to be received by Cvent stockholders in the Merger represents\na premium of approximately (a) 52% to the volume weighted average share price over the 90 days prior to\nJanuary 30, 2023, the day before media reports of a potential transaction were published and (b) 15% to the\nclosing share price on March 13, 2023, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the per share price of $8.50 in cash is more favorable to Company stockholders on a risk-\nadjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to the\nCompany, based upon the Special Committee members\u2019 extensive knowledge of the Company\u2019s business,\nassets, financial condition and results of operations, the execution challenges that the Company potentially\nfaces, the Company\u2019s historical and projected financial performance, and market dynamics\u037e\n\u2022\nthe sale process conducted by the Company, with the assistance of Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland, to\nreview other potential strategic alternatives and, in connection therewith, the engagement with a range of\ncounterparties (including Parent) regarding their interest in a potential acquisition of the Company\u037e\n49TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe belief that, after multiple rounds of negotiations with Parent, $8.50 per share is the highest price that\nParent is willing to pay and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to the\nCompany, in the aggregate, to which Parent is willing to agree and that further soliciting other potential\nbuyers would not yield proposals of greater value\u037e\n\u2022\nthe determination that the terms of the preferred equity (which is the security being offered to the Vista\nStockholders in return for Vista\u2019s reinvestment of its cash proceeds from the transaction into the post-\nclosing Company) are not more favorable in the aggregate to the Vista Stockholders than as could be\nachieved in arm\u2019s-length similar transactions in the prevailing market\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Special Committee\u2019s view on the potential effect of the Vista Preferred Financing if similar financings\nwere offered to other bidders in the sale process\u037e\n\u2022\nthe oral opinion of J.P.

factors, which are not presented in any relative order of\nimportance, including:\n\u2022\nthat, following the completion of the Merger, the Company will no longer exist as an independent public\ncompany and that the consummation of the Merger and receipt of the Merger Consideration, while\nproviding relative certainty of value, will not allow the Company stockholders to participate in

Proposal prior to the Company being able\nto terminate the Merger Agreement and accept a Superior Proposal to be a deterrent to making alternative\nproposals\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the Company may be obligated to pay Parent a $138,608,439 termination fee upon the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the terms of the Merger Agreement place restrictions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business prior\nto completion of the Merger, which may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business\nopportunities that may arise

material breach, or and is unable to complete\nthe Merger due to the unavailability of its debt financing and therefore the Company is unable to\nspecifically enforce Parent\u2019s obligation to complete the Merger, then the Company would need to sue for\nmonetary damages which are capped at $277,216,878 (plus certain reimbursement and enforcement\nexpenses), or, only if payable, elect to receive a termination fee equal to $277,216,878 (plus certain\nreimbursement and enforcement expenses), each of which may be inadequate to compensate the Company\nfor the damage caused, and if available, such rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce,\nand the success of any such action may be uncertain\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that completion of the Merger requires certain regulatory clearances and consents\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possible effects of the pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, including the potential for suits, actions or proceedings in respect of the Merger Agreement or\nthe transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the consideration consists of cash and will therefore be taxable to Company stockholders who\nare subject to taxation for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe risk that, while the Merger is expected to be completed, there can be no guarantee that all conditions to\nthe parties\u2019 obligations to complete the Merger will be satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the\nMerger may not be completed even if approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders at the Special Meeting.\nThis discussion of the information and factors considered by the Special Committee includes the material positive\nand negative factors considered by the Special Committee, but it is not intended to be exhaustive and may not\ninclude all the factors considered by the Special Committee. The Special Committee did not quantify or assign any\nspecific weights to the various factors that it considered in reaching its determination to approve the Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Rather, the Special Committee viewed its position and\nrecommendation as being based on the totality of the information presented to, and factors considered by, it. In\naddition, individual members of the Special Committee may have given differing weights to different factors.\nThe explanation of the reasoning of the Special Committee and certain information presented in this section is\nforward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy statement\ntitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe Board\nThe Board carefully reviewed and considered the proposed Merger in consultation with Cvent\u2019s senior management\nand legal and financial advisors and, upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Board\nunanimously: (a) determined that it was in the best interests of Cvent and its stockholders, and declared it advisable,\nto enter into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger, in accordance with the DGCL, and the other\nTransaction Documents\u037e (b) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction\nDocuments by Cvent, the performance by Cvent of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the\nconsummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein\u037e (c) recommended that\nthe stockholders of Cvent adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL\u037e and (d) directed that the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of Cvent at a meeting thereof.\nAccordingly, the Board recommends that stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nIn reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, and to recommend that Cvent stockholders adopt the\nMerger Agreement, the Board considered the following positive reasons to support the Merger and recommend\nadoption of the Merger Agreement:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the price per share of $8.50 in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate value\nand liquidity to Cvent stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Cvent common\nstock, including the fact that the $8.50 per share to be received by Cvent stockholders in the Merger\nrepresents a premium of approximately (a) 52% over the volume weighted average price per share for the 90\ndays ending January 30, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the publishing of media reports of a potential\ntransaction involving Cvent and (b) 15% to the closing share price on March 13, 2023, the last trading day\nprior to the announcement of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe limited liquidity of the shares of Cvent common stock due to Cvent\u2019s high concentration of ownership\u037e\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe current and prospective business environment in which Cvent operates\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the per share price of $8.50 in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to Cvent\nstockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives\nreasonably available to Cvent, based upon the Board\u2019s extensive knowledge of Cvent\u2019s business, assets,\nfinancial condition and results of operations, the current macro-economic environment, Cvent\u2019s historical\nand projected financial performance, and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger represented an\nattractive and comparatively certain value for Cvent stockholders relative to the risk-adjusted prospects for\nCvent as a standalone public company\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing Cvent\u2019s stockholders associated with possible\nstrategic alternatives to the Merger (including possible alternative business combinations and scenarios\ninvolving the possibility of remaining a standalone public company), and the timing, risks and likelihood of\naccomplishing such alternatives, taking into account the Board\u2019s belief that there were likely no other\npotential strategic or financial purchasers or other parties that would be reasonably likely to engage in a\ntransaction in the near term at a price greater than the price being offered by Blackstone\u037e\n\u2022\nthe process conducted by Cvent, with the assistance of its advisors, to review other potential strategic\nalternatives and, in connection therewith, the engagement with numerous counterparties regarding their\ninterest in a potential acquisition of Cvent\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that (a) following outreach from Blackstone, Qatalyst contacted 11 other prospective buyers\n(including seven financial sponsors and four strategic sponsors) to gauge their interest in a potential\nacquisition of Cvent, and received inbound indications of interest from six other prospective buyers, (b)\nover the course of several months, four prospective buyers (including Blackstone) entered into\nconfidentiality agreements with Cvent, to explore a potential transaction and (c) Blackstone was the only\nremaining viable acquiror of Cvent in the sale process\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Blackstone that was fully negotiated and not\nsubject to the completion of additional confirmatory diligence in the event that, after running a fulsome\nprocess, Cvent sought to pursue or continue discussions with other third parties who may be interested in\npursuing a strategic transaction with Cvent prior to entry into the Merger Agreement and the potential\nnegative effect that such a process might have on Cvent\u2019s business\u037e\n\u2022\nthe business reputation, experience, expertise and capabilities of Blackstone, and its strong track record of\ninvesting in the events, hospitality and real estate sectors, and Blackstone\u2019s commitment to investing in\nCvent\u2019s mission of delivering innovative and comprehensive solutions to power the entire meetings and\nevents ecosystem\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief that, after the Board and its representatives negotiated with Blackstone and its\nrepresentatives (as described in more detail under the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger -\nBackground of the Merger\u201d), the per share price of $8.50 was the highest price that Blackstone was willing\nto offer and pay (taking into account the terms of the Vista Preferred Financing) as of the date of execution\nof the Merger Agreement and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to\nCvent, in the aggregate, to which Blackstone would be willing to agree\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that no potential acquirors submitted a competitive acquisition proposal or indication of interest\nfollowing the publication of the WSJ Article on January 31, 2023 indicating that Cvent was exploring a\npotential sale, despite public awareness of a proposal from Blackstone\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Vista Stockholders were requested to, and agreed to, provide seller financing in the form of\nthe Vista Preferred Financing, in order to obtain the per share price of $8.50 to be paid by Blackstone, and\nother stockholders were not asked or required to provide seller financing\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that, if Cvent did not enter into the Merger Agreement with Blackstone, there could be a\nconsiderable period of time, if ever, before the unaffected trading price per share of Cvent\u2019s common stock\nwould reach and sustain the per share price of $8.50, as adjusted for present value (even assuming full\nrealization of the management projections)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Qatalyst Partners delivered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to\nthe effect that, as of March 13, 2023, and based

of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to\nbe received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of\nshares of

            "text": "Opinion of Qatalyst Partners\nThe Company retained Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisor to the Cvent Board in connection with a potential\ntransaction such as the Merger and to evaluate whether the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company\ncommon stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the\nMerger Agreement by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of\nParent), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company selected Qatalyst Partners to act as the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 qualifications, expertise, reputation, its knowledge of the\nCompany\u2019s business and the industry in which the Company operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written\nconsent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the Cvent Board on March 13,\n2023, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Cvent Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect\nthat, as of March 13, 2023 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and\nother matters set forth therein, the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash,\nwithout interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by\nthe holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders. Following the meeting, Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion, dated\nMarch 13, 2023, to the Cvent Board.\nThe full text of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 written opinion, dated as of March 13, 2023, is attached to this proxy statement\nas Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The opinion sets forth, among other things,\nthe assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review\nundertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its entirety.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion was provided to the Cvent Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common\nstock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger\nAgreement by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to\nsuch holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the Merger. It does not constitute a recommendation to any\nCompany stockholder as to how to vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner\naddress the price at which the shares of the Company common stock will trade at any time. The summary of\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion,\nwhich is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.\nFor purposes of its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated March 13, 2023 (the\n\u201cDraft Merger Agreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other\nbusiness and financial information of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the February Projections,\n56TABLE OF CONTENTS\nwhich are described more fully in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Certain Financial\nProjections.\u201d Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and\nthe prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the\nhistorical market prices and trading activity for the Company common stock and compared the financial performance\nof the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company common stock with that of certain other selected\npublicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the\nextent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such\nother information and considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy\nand completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or\ndiscussed with, Qatalyst Partners by the Company. With respect to the February Projections, Qatalyst Partners was\nadvised by the Company\u2019s management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based on discussions with the management\nand the Cvent Board, that the February Projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance\nof the Company and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that terms of the Draft Merger\nAgreement would not differ materially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger would be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Draft Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver\nor delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of\nthe proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse\neffect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Qatalyst\nPartners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of\nthe Company or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition,\nQatalyst Partners relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company\nas to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology\nand products. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion has been approved by Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion committee in accordance\nwith its customary practice. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how to vote with\nrespect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which the shares of the\nCompany common stock will trade at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on,\nand the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion\nmay affect Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners did not assume\nany obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion did not address the underlying\nbusiness decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any\nstrategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is limited to the fairness, from\na financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash,\nwithout interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by\nthe holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), and Qatalyst\nPartners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of (a) the compensation to any of\nthe officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to\nsuch consideration or (b) any consideration to be received by the Vista Stockholders or any of their affiliates other\nthan the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to\nbe received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nThe following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion\ndated March 13, 2023. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any\nportion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion. For purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners\nutilized both the consensus of third-party research analysts\u2019 projections of the future financial performance of the\nCompany as of March 13, 2023 (the \u201cAnalyst Projections\u201d) and the February Projections. Some of the summaries of\nthe financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and\nin order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together\nwith the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative\ndescription of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could\ncreate a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses.\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of\npotential per-share present values for the Company common stock as of December 31, 2022 (which is the end of the\nCompany\u2019s most recent completed fiscal year and most recent balance sheet date) by:\n\u2022\nadding:\n(a)\nthe implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of the Company, based\non the February Projections, for calendar year 2023 through calendar year 2027 (which implied present\nvalue was calculated by using a range of discount rates of 12.0% to 15.0%, based on an estimated\nweighted average cost of capital for the Company calculated using the capital asset pricing model and\ninputs based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment)\u037e\n(b)\nthe implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of the Company, calculated by\nmultiplying the estimated unlevered free cash flow of the Company in calendar year 2028 of\napproximately $476 million based on the February Projections, by a range of multiples of fully diluted\nenterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated unlevered free cash flow of 16.0x to 24.0x (which was\nchosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment), and discounted to present value using\nthe same range of discount rates used in item (a) above\u037e and\n(c)\nthe Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents of approximately $140 million as of December 31, 2022, as\nprovided by the Company\u2019s management\u037e and\n\u2022\nsubtracting:\n(a)\nthe principal amount of the Company\u2019s outstanding senior secured revolving credit facility of\napproximately $208 million as of December 31, 2022, as provided by the Company\u2019s management\u037e and\n(b)\nfees payable to customers of approximately $38 million, as provided by the Company\u2019s management\u037e\nand\n\u2022\ndividing the resulting amount by the number of fully-diluted shares of the Company common stock\n(calculated utilizing the treasury stock method) as of March 10, 2023, which takes into account the Options\nand RSU awards as of March 10, 2023, all of which amounts were provided by the Company\u2019s management,\nwith each of the above-referenced estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value having\nalso been adjusted for the degree of estimated dilution to current stockholders through each respective\napplicable period (approximately 4% annually through calendar year 2027) due to the estimated net effects\nof equity issuances and cancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future\ndilution provided by the Company\u2019s management.\nBased on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for the Company common\nstock of approximately $7.09 to $11.25.\nSelected Companies Analysis\nQatalyst Partners reviewed and compared selected financial information and public market multiples for the Company\nwith publicly available information and public market multiples for selected companies, which were selected by\nQatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in\nsimilar lines of business to the Company, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have\nother relevant or similar characteristics.\nBased upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the selected companies as of March 13, 2023, and\nusing the closing trading prices as of March 13, 2023 for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners\ncalculated, among other things, the implied fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus\nrevenue for calendar year 2023 (the \u201cCY2023E Revenue Multiples\u201d) for each of the selected companies.\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe companies used in this comparison are listed below:\nSelected

Price, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E Revenue\nMultiple for the Company of 4.8x.\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E Revenue Multiples for the selected companies and the application of its\nprofessional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 4.0x to 6.5x and applied this\nrange to the Company\u2019s estimated calendar year 2023 revenue based on each of the February Projections and the\nAnalyst Projections. Based on the calculations in the immediately preceding sentence and the number of fully-diluted\nshares of the Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock method) as of March 10, 2023, which\ntakes into account the Options and RSU awards as of March 10, 2023, all of which amounts were provided by the\nCompany\u2019s management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for the Company common stock of\napproximately $5.44 to $8.76 based on the February Projections and approximately $5.53 to $8.90 based on the\nAnalyst Projections.\nNo company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected\ncompanies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters.

Based on the calculations in the immediately preceding sentence\nand the number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock method) as\nof March 10, 2023, which takes into account the Options and RSU awards as of March 10, 2023, all of which amounts\nwere provided by the Company\u2019s management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for the Company\ncommon stock of approximately $7.03 to $11.04.\nBased on the analysis of the NTM Revenue Multiple for each of the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners selected\na representative multiple range of 5.3x to 8.4x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners' professional judgment)\nand applied that range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for the twelve-month period ending on September 30,\n2023 of $706 million, based on the Analyst Projections. Based on the calculations in the immediately preceding\nsentence and the same fully-diluted share count calculation as used for the analysis utilizing LTM Revenue Multiples\nabove, this analysis implied a range of per share values for the Company common stock of approximately $6.95 to\n$10.97.\nNo company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to the Company or the Merger. In\nevaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to general\nbusiness, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such\nas the impact of competition on the Company\u2019s business or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence\nof any material adverse change in the Company\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial\nmarkets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the\ntransactions to which they are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining\nthe arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.\nBecause of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the Merger, Qatalyst Partners cautions\nagainst placing undue reliance on this information.\nMiscellaneous\nIn connection with the review of the Merger by the Cvent Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial\nand comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex\nprocess and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion,\nQatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to\nany analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without\nconsidering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its\nanalyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given various analyses and factors more or less\nweight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other\nassumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not\nbe taken to be Qatalyst Partners\u2019 view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst\nPartners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and\nfinancial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Any estimates contained in\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nQatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, of the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash, without\ninterest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the\nholders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders. This\nanalysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the price at which the Company common stock might\nactually trade at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and its presentation to the Cvent Board was one of many factors considered by the Cvent\nBoard in deciding to approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be\nviewed as determinative of the opinion of the Cvent Board with respect to the merger consideration of $8.50 per share\nof the Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with,\nthe terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any\naffiliate of Parent), or of whether the Cvent Board would have been willing to agree to different consideration. The\nmerger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, payable in\nthe Merger was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was\nunanimously approved by the Special Committee and the Cvent Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to the\n61\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to\nthe Company or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,\ndomestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these\nactivities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise\neffect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.\nDuring the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion, no material relationship existed between\nQatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n(\u201cVista Equity Partners Management\u201d), Parent or Blackstone, an affiliate of Parent, on the other hand, pursuant to\nwhich compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except for a fee of approximately $62 million\nreceived by Qatalyst Partners in connection with acting as a financial advisor to Datto Holding Corp., a portfolio\ncompany of Vista Equity Partners Management, in connection with its announced transaction involving Kaseya\nHoldings Inc. and Kaseya Inc. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may have provided, and may in the future\nprovide, investment banking and other financial services to the Company, Vista Equity Partners Management, Parent\nor Blackstone, or their respective affiliates, in each case, for which Qatalyst Partners may have received, or would\nexpect to receive, compensation. The information disclosed in this paragraph regarding relationships of Qatalyst\nPartners and fees recognized by it is based upon information provided to the Company by Qatalyst Partners.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided the Company with financial advisory services\nin connection with the proposed Merger for which it will be paid approximately $50 million, $5 million of which was\npayable upon the delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining\nportion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the consummation of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to\nreimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. The Company has also agreed to\nindemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and\nemployees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including\nliabilities under federal securities law, and certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners\u2019\nengagement.\nOpinion of J.P.

            "text": "Opinion of J.P. Morgan\nThe Special Committee retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger and to\ndeliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed Merger.\nAt the meeting of the Special Committee on March 13, 2023, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Special\nCommittee, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated as of March 14, 2023, that as of\nthe date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the\nMerger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Cvent Common Stock (other than shares of Cvent common stock\nheld by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), in each\ncase, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly exercised their\nstatutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or the Vista Stockholders) in the proposed\nMerger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated March 14, 2023, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this Proxy\nStatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this Proxy\nStatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company\u2019s stockholders are\nurged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the Special Committee (in its\ncapacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed\nonly to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company common stock (other than shares of\nCvent common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including\nMerger Sub), in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly\nexercised their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or the Vista Stockholders) in\nthe Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness\nof any consideration paid in connection with the Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or\nother constituencies of the Company, as to the Preferred Equity Financing or the Preferred Commitment Letter, or as\nto the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion\nwas approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any\nstockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any\nother matter.\n62TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft dated March 13, 2023 of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain\ntransactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of the Company common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company\nrelating to its business, as approved for J.P. Morgan\u2019s use by the Special Committee\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with the Special Committee and certain members of the management of the\nCompany with respect to certain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of the\nCompany, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters J.P.\nMorgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for\nJ.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify (and did not assume responsibility or liability for\nindependently verifying) any such information or its accuracy or completeness. J.P. Morgan did not conduct nor was\nit provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of\nthe Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying\non financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they\nwere reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by\nmanagement of the Company and the Special Committee as to the expected future results of operations and financial\ncondition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such\nanalyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger\nAgreement, and that the definitive Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof\nprovided to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company\nand Parent in the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects\nmaterial to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by\nadvisors to the Company with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental,\nregulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without\nany adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company common stock (other than shares of Cvent\ncommon stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger\nSub), in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly\nexercised their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or the Vista Stockholders) in\nthe proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the\nholders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, as to the Preferred Equity\nFinancing or the Preferred Commitment Letter, or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMerger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to\nany officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to\nthe Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company common stock in the proposed Merger or with\nrespect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nJ.P. Morgan was not authorized by the Special Committee or otherwise to and did not solicit any expressions of\ninterest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of the Company or any other alternative\ntransaction.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm\u2019s length\nnegotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that\nof the Special Committee and the Cvent Board. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the\nmany factors considered by the Special Committee in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be\nviewed as determinative of the views of the Special Committee, the Cvent Board or the Company\u2019s management with\nrespect to the proposed Merger or the Merger Consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the Special Committee on March 13, 2023, which was subsequently\nconfirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated as of March 14, 2023, and in the financial analyses presented to the\nSpecial Committee on March 13, 2023 in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary\nof the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its opinion to the Special\nCommittee and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some\nof the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not\nintended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables\nmust be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering\nthe full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the\nanalyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the Company with similar data\nfor selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to the\nCompany. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were:\n\u2022\nDocuSign, Inc.\n\u2022\nNew Relic, Inc.\n\u2022\nFive9, Inc.\n\u2022\nPaycor HCM, Inc.\n\u2022\nFreshworks Inc.\n\u2022\nVertex, Inc.\n\u2022\nZeta Global Holdings Corp.\n\u2022\nSprinklr, Inc.\nThese companies were selected because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for\npurposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, were considered similar to the Company. However, certain of these companies\nmay have characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. The analyses necessarily involve\ncomplex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the\ncompanies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies differently than they would affect the\nCompany.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the multiple of the firm value\n(the \u201cFV\u201d) (calculated as equity value, plus or minus, as applicable, net debt or net cash) to the analyst consensus\nestimates of calendar year 2023 and 2024 revenues for the applicable company (the \u201cFV/2023E Revenue Multiple\u201d and\n\u201cFV/2024E Revenue Multiple\u201d).\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis.\n \nCompany\nFV/2023E Revenue Multiple\nFV/2024E Revenue Multiple\nDocuSign, Inc.\n4.2x\n3.9x\nNew Relic, Inc.\n4.8x\n4.1x\nFive9, Inc.\n5.2x\n4.4x\nPaycor HCM, Inc.\n6.8x\n5.8x\nFreshworks Inc.\n5.8x\n4.9x\nVertex, Inc.\n5.2x\n4.6x\nZeta Global Holdings Corp.\n4.1x\n3.4x\nSprinklr, Inc.\n3.3x\n2.9x\nBased on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/2023E Revenue Multiple reference range for the\nCompany of 3.3x to 5.8x and a FV/2024E Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of 2.9x to 4.9x. J.P.\nMorgan then applied such reference ranges to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for calendar years 2023 and 2024,\nrespectively, as set forth in the February Projections. These analyses indicated a range of firm values, which was then\nadjusted to take into account the Company\u2019s net debt of $106 million obtained from the Company\u2019s management,\ncalculated as of December 31, 2022 to derive ranges of implied per share equity value for the Company common stock\n(rounded to the nearest $0.10) of approximately $4.50 to $7.90 and $4.80 to $8.10 for 2023 and 2024, respectively. J.P.\nMorgan compared this to the Merger Consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock.\nSelected Transaction Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving businesses which J.P.\nMorgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the Company\u2019s business (or aspects thereof) based on J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nexperience and familiarity with the industries in which the Company operates.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the multiple of the target\ncompany's FV implied in the relevant transaction to the target company's estimated revenue for the twelve months\nimmediately following the announcement of the applicable transaction (the \u201cFV/NTM Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nThe following transactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as relevant to the evaluation of the proposed Merger and\nthe FV/NTM Revenue Multiple for each such transaction are as indicated in the following table:\n \nAnnouncement Date\nTarget\nAcquiror\nFV/NTM \nRevenue\nMultiple\nJanuary 9, 2023\nDuck Creek Technologies, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n6.8x\nDecember 12, 2022\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nThoma Bravo LP\n8.6x\nJune 24, 2022\nZendesk, Inc.\nHellman & Friedman LLC and Permira\nAdvisers LLC\n5.8x\nDecember 17, 2021\nBottomline Technologies, Inc.\nThoma Bravo LP\n4.8x\nAugust 5, 2021\nCornerstone OnDemand, Inc.\nClearlake Capital Group, L.P.\n5.8x\nFebruary 13, 2020\nRIB Software SE\nSchneider Electric SE\n5.0x\nOctober 14, 2019\nSophos Group PLC\nThoma Bravo LP\n4.6x\nJune 11, 2019\nMedidata Solutions, Inc.\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes SE\n7.4x\nDecember 24, 2018\nMINDBODY, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n6.7x\nNovember 12, 2018\nAthenaHealth, Inc.\nVeritas Capital and Elliot Management\n3.9x\nApril 18, 2016\nCvent, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n6.0x\nNone of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. However, the selected transactions\nwere chosen by J.P. Morgan because J.P. Morgan judged certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s analysis, to be similar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations\nand judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and\nother factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.\nBased on the results of this analysis and J.P. Morgan\u2019s professional judgment and experience, J.P. Morgan selected a\nFV/NTM Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of 4.0x to 8.5x. J.P. Morgan then applied such\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreference range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for calendar year 2023 as set forth in the February Projections.\nThe analysis indicated a range of firm values, which was then adjusted to take into account the Company's net debt\nof $106 million obtained from the Company\u2019s management, calculated as of December 31, 2022, which further\nindicated a range of implied per share equity value for the Company common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.10) of\napproximately $5.50 to $11.40, which J.P. Morgan compared to the Merger Consideration of $8.50 per share of the\nCompany common stock.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis, using the unlevered free cash flows (less stock-based\ncompensation) that the Company was forecasted to generate from December 31, 2022 through fiscal year 2028, as set\nforth in the February Projections, for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share for the\nCompany common stock. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the end of the 6-\nyear period ending in 2028 by applying terminal growth rates ranging from 4.5% to 5.5%, which were determined\nbased on J.P. Morgan's professional judgment and experience, to estimates of terminal revenue for the Company at\nthe terminal year, based on the February Projections. J.P. Morgan then discounted such unlevered free cash flow\nestimates and the range of terminal values to present value as of December 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging\nfrom 11.0% to 12.0%, which range was chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost\nof capital of the Company. The present values of such unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal\nvalues were then adjusted for the Company\u2019s estimated net debt of $106 million obtained from the Company\nmanagement, calculated as of December 31, 2022 to derive implied equity values per share of the Company common\nstock on a fully diluted basis. This analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the Company\ncommon stock (rounded to the nearest $0.10) of $6.30 to $8.60, which J.P. Morgan compared to the Merger\nConsideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock.\nOther Information\nJ.P. Morgan observed certain additional information for reference purposes only and not as a component of its\nfairness analysis:\n\u2022\n52-Week Historical Trading Range. J.P. Morgan reviewed the 52-week trading range of the Company\ncommon stock for the period ending January 30, 2023, representing the last unaffected trading day prior to\nnews that the Company was exploring a sale, which was $4.09 to $8.91 per share of the Company common\nstock. J.P. Morgan compared that range to (a) the closing share price of the Company common stock of\n$4.09 on June 10, 2022, (b) the closing share price of the Company common stock of $8.91 on March 10,\n2022 and (c) the Merger Consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock. J.P. Morgan noted\nthat historical trading range analyses were presented merely for reference purposes only and not as a\ncomponent of its fairness analysis.\n\u2022\nAnalyst Price Targets. J.P. Morgan reviewed the price targets of five publicly available equity research\nanalysts for the Company common stock available as of March 13, 2023, which provided a reference range\nof $6.00 to $11.00 per share of the Company common stock. J.P. Morgan compared the analyst price targets\nanalysis to (a) the closing share price of the Company Common Stock of $6.57 on January 30, 2023, the last\nunaffected trading day prior to news that the Company was exploring a sale, and (b) the Merger\nConsideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock. J.P. Morgan noted that the analyst price\ntarget analyses were presented merely for reference purposes only and not as a component of its fairness\nanalysis.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the\nanalyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not\nnecessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary\nand its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these\nanalyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes\nunderlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or\ncombination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes\nand should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the Company, the order of\nanalyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In\narriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nit and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in\nisolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of the factors and\nanalyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.\nMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected\ncompanies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the selected\ntransactions reviewed was identical to the Merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are\npublicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be\nconsidered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their\nparticipants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger.\nThe analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to\nthe Company and the transactions compared to the Merger.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control\npurposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Special Committee and deliver an\nopinion to the Special Committee with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience\nand its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the\nindustries in which it operates.\nJ.P. Morgan received a fee from the Company of $4,000,000 for the rendering of its opinion to the Special Committee.\nIn addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its\nservices, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities\narising out of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement.\nDuring the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had\ncommercial or investment banking relationships with the Company, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have\nreceived customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as co-placement agent on\nan offering of equity securities of the Company\u2019s predecessor in December 2021. During the two years preceding the\ndate of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have also had commercial or investment banking\nrelationships with the Company\u2019s approximately 81% stockholder, Vista Equity Partners (\u201cVista\u201d), for which J.P.\nMorgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included\nproviding debt syndication services, equity underwriting, and financial advisory services to Vista portfolio\ncompanies. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates\nhave also had commercial or investment banking relationships with Parent\u2019s parent entity, Blackstone, for which J.P.\nMorgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included\nacting as joint lead arranger on a syndicated credit facility for a Blackstone affiliate in February 2021, joint lead\nbookrunner on an offering of debt securities of a Blackstone affiliate in September 2021, joint lead bookrunner on an\noffering of equity securities of a Blackstone affiliate in September 2021 and financial advisor to a Blackstone affiliate\non its acquisition of an ownership stake in Elba Liquefaction Company in May 2022. During the two years preceding\nthe date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have also had commercial or investment\nbanking relationships with Blackstone portfolio companies, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received\ncustomary compensation. Such services during such period have included providing debt syndication, equity\nunderwriting, debt underwriting and financial advisory services to Blackstone portfolio companies. In addition, J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Vista and its\nportfolio companies and Blackstone and its portfolio companies, for which it receives customary compensation or\nother financial benefits. During the two-year period preceding delivery of its written opinion ending on March 14,\n2023, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from the Company were approximately $37 million, from Vista were\napproximately $30.4 million, and from Blackstone were approximately $239.6 million, as provided by J.P. Morgan. In\naddition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of\neach of the Company and Blackstone. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank\nloans or other obligations) of the Company or Blackstone for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers\nand, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.",

            "text": "Certain Financial Projections\nThe Company does not, in the ordinary course, make long-term projections as to future performance available to the\npublic, given, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and\nthe likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized or may change. In connection with\nthe evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, senior management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial\ninformation for the Company. Financial projections for the remainder of fiscal year 2022 and fiscal years 2023 through\n2025 were prepared by senior management and were reviewed and approved for use by the Board on December 6,\n2022 (the \u201cDecember Projections\u201d). The December Projections were (a) shared on December 8, 2022 with Blackstone\nand (b) uploaded on December 9, 2022 to the virtual data room set up for the transaction, where other potential\nbidders that were admitted to the virtual data room were provided with access to the December Projections. At the\nrequest of Blackstone, the Company\u2019s management also prepared free cash flow projections for each quarter of fiscal\nyear 2023 (the \u201cSupplemental Free Cash Flow Projections\u201d), which were calculated based on the Adjusted EBITDA\nfor fiscal year 2023 on a quarterly basis and were approved by the Board on January 6, 2023, and provided to\nBlackstone on January 8, 2023. At the direction of the Board, the Company\u2019s management also prepared free cash\nflow projections for fiscal years 2024 through 2028 and extrapolated the December Projections to include projections\nfor fiscal years 2026 through 2028 (the \u201cJanuary Projections\u201d), which were approved by the Board on January 6, 2023.\nIn February, the Company\u2019s management updated each of the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections (as updated,\nthe \u201cUpdated Free Cash Flow Projections\u201d) and the January Projections (as updated, the \u201cFebruary Projections\u201d) to\nreflect refined assumptions with respect to projected cash taxes for fiscal year 2023 and the impact of such refined\nassumptions on the Company and its free cash flow. The Updated Free Cash Flow Projections were calculated based\non the Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2023 on a quarterly basis, were approved by the Board on February 12, 2023\nand were provided to Blackstone on February 13, 2023, and the February Projections were approved by the Board on\nFebruary 12, 2023 for use and reliance by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its financial analyses and in\nconnection with its opinion to the Board as described above under the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe\nMerger - Opinion of Qatalyst Partners.\u201d The February Projections were also approved by the Special Committee on\nMarch 9, 2023 for use and reliance by J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analyses and in connection with its\nopinion to the Special Committee described above under the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger -\nOpinion of J.P. Morgan.\u201d The February Projections, the January Projections, the December Projections, the Updated\nFree Cash Flow Projections and the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections are collectively referred to herein as the\n\u201cProjections.\u201d\nThe Projections were prepared by senior management at the direction of the Board. The Projections were not\nprepared with a view toward public disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines\nof the SEC or established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation\nof prospective financial information or generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Projections have\nbeen prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company\u2019s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not\naudited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying\nprojections and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of\nassurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy\nstatement relates to the Company\u2019s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the Projections and\nshould not be read to do so.\nThe tables below present summaries of the Projections, as prepared by senior management and provided by senior\nmanagement to the Board and the Special Committee. The Projections summarized below are included solely to\nprovide the Company\u2019s stockholders access to financial projections that were made available to the Board, the\nSpecial Committee, Qatalyst Partners, J.P. Morgan and/or Blackstone in connection with the proposed Merger, and\nare not included in this proxy statement to influence a Company\u2019s stockholder\u2019s decision whether to vote to adopt\nthe Merger Agreement or for any other purpose.\nThe Projections summarized below, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables and\nassumptions that necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive,\nregulatory and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are\nbeyond the Company\u2019s control. The Projections also reflect assumptions that are subject to change, including, but\nnot limited to, assumptions regarding: demand for events and meetings, the return to in-person events,\n68TABLE OF CONTENTS\ndemand for advertising and software solutions, and demand for an integrated platform\u037e growth rates\u037e market share\u037e\nmarket size and conditions\u037e products and product mix\u037e contract duration expansion\u037e renewal rates\u037e operating\nexpenses\u037e margins\u037e ability to maintain and expand relationships with hotels and venues\u037e and net working capital. The\nProjections cover multiple years, and thus, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each\nsuccessive year. Important factors that may affect actual results and the achievability of the Projections include, but\nare not limited to: general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial, debt, capital, credit or securities\nmarkets\u037e industry and market dynamics\u037e competition\u037e fluctuations in currency exchange rates\u037e changes in applicable\nlaws\u037e and those risks and uncertainties described in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2022. See also the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements.\u201d\nIn addition, the Projections reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple\ninterpretations based on actual results, revised prospects for the Company\u2019s business, changes in general business\nor economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not\nanticipated when the Projections were prepared. Accordingly, actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from\nthose contained in the Projections. The Projections assume organic company growth without business expansions\nfrom mergers and acquisitions or alternative business or licensing models. In addition, the Projections do not take\ninto account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the Projections were\nprepared and do not give effect to any changes or expenses incurred after the date on which they were made,\nincluding as a result of the Merger or any effects of the Merger. The Company does not intend to update or\notherwise revise the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date on which the Projections were\nprepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions\nare shown to be in error. There can be no assurance that the financial results in the Projections will be realized, or that\nfuture actual financial results will not materially vary from those estimated in the Projections.\nCertain of the measures included in the Projections, including adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow, are\nfinancial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not\nbe viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures\nused by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures, because they\nexclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the SEC\u2019s rules\nconcerning non-GAAP financial measures and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-\nGAAP financial measures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is\nincluded in a document such as this proxy statement, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared\nor relied upon by the Board or the Special Committee in connection with their consideration of the Merger Agreement\nor by either Qatalyst Partners of J.P. Morgan for purposes of its financial analyses. Accordingly, the Company has\nnot provided a reconciliation of any financial measures included in the Projections.\nThe following table is a summary of the December Projections:\n($ in millions)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\nRevenue\n$630\n$728\n$886\n$1,065\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$110\n$147\n$228\n$\n327\nThe following table is a summary of the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections:\n($ in millions)\n1Q23E\n2Q23E\n3Q23E\n4Q23E\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(2)\n$53\n$26\n$9\n$9\nThe following table is a summary of the Updated Free Cash Flow Projections:\n($ in millions)\n1Q23E\n2Q23E\n3Q23E\n4Q23E\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(2)\n$50\n$23\n$6\n$7\n69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table is a summary of the January Projections:\n($ in millions)\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\n2028E\nRevenue\n$728\n$886\n$1,065\n$1,256\n$1,470\n$1,710\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$147\n$228\n$\n327\n$\n418\n$\n522\n$\n640\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(2)\n$ 96\n$126\n$\n186\n$\n263\n$\n345\n$\n431\nThe following table is a summary of the February Projections:\n($ in millions)\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\n2028E\nRevenue\n$728\n$886\n$1,065\n$1,256\n$1,470\n$1,710\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$147\n$228\n$\n327\n$\n418\n$\n522\n$\n640\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(3)\n$ 86\n$155\n$\n214\n$\n294\n$\n383\n$\n476\n \n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA means net loss adjusted for interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount,\ngain/(loss) on extinguishment of debt, gain/(loss) on divestitures, net other income/(expense), net provision for/(benefit from)\nincome taxes, depreciation, amortization of software development costs, intangible asset amortization, stock-based\ncompensation expense, restructuring expense, cost related to acquisitions, and other items.\n(2)\nUnlevered Free Cash Flows means Adjusted EBITDA less (i) capital software development costs, less (ii) purchases of property\nand equipment, less (iii) cash non-GAAP items, less (iv) taxes paid, plus (v) change in net working capital, and is not burdened by\nstock-based compensation expense.\n(3)\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow means Adjusted EBITDA less (i) capital software development costs, less (ii) purchases of property and\nequipment, less (iii) cash non-GAAP items, less (iv) taxes paid, plus (v) change in net working capital, and is not burdened by\nstock-based compensation expense of $67 million for fiscal year 2023, $85 million for fiscal year 2024, $113 million for fiscal\nyear 2025, $125 million for fiscal year 2026, $131 million for fiscal year 2027 and $137 million for fiscal year 2028.\nThe inclusion of selected elements of the Projections in the tables and accompanying narrative above should not be\nregarded as an indication that the Company and/or any of our affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other\nrepresentatives consider the Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this information\nshould not be relied upon as such. The Projections were based upon certain financial, operating and commercial\nassumptions developed solely using the information available to the Company\u2019s senior management at the time the\nProjections were created. None of the Company and/or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other\nrepresentatives gives any Company\u2019s stockholder or any other person any assurance that actual results will not\ndiffer materially from the Projections and, except as otherwise required by law, the Company and/or its affiliates,\nofficers, directors, advisors or other representatives undertake no obligation to update or otherwise revise or\nreconcile the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date on which the Projections were prepared or to\nreflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying\nthe Projections are shown to be in error. The Company has made no representation to Parent or Merger Sub\nconcerning the Projections in the Merger Agreement or otherwise.\nIn light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections, the Company\u2019s stockholders are\ncautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on such Projections.\nCertain Effects of the Merger",

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following discussion summarizes certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of\nCvent common stock who receive cash in exchange for shares of Cvent common stock pursuant to the Merger. This\ndiscussion is for general informational purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential\ntax consequences of the Merger. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the U.S. Treasury\nRegulations promulgated thereunder and judicial decisions and administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the date of\nthis proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.\nAny such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements set forth herein. The U.S.\nfederal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have not sought, and do not intend to\nseek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (referred to herein as the \u201cIRS\u201d) regarding any of the tax issues\ndiscussed herein. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences of\nthe Merger described in this proxy statement.\nThis discussion assumes that holders of Cvent common stock hold their shares as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all\naspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder of Cvent common stock in light of\nsuch holder\u2019s individual circumstances, nor does it address U.S. state or local, non-U.S., or estate or gift taxes, the\nalternative minimum tax, the rules regarding qualified small business stock within the meaning of Section 1202 of the\nCode, the Medicare tax on net investment income or any other aspect of any U.S. federal tax other than the income\ntax. This discussion also does not address tax considerations that may be relevant to holders of Cvent common stock\nsubject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example, financial institutions, brokers\nor dealers in securities or currencies, mutual funds, partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as\npartnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities and their partners or members, S\ncorporations, tax-exempt organizations, governmental organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts,\ninsurance companies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market method of accounting, controlled foreign\ncorporations, passive foreign investment companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal\nincome tax, U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired their\nCvent common stock through the exercise of Company stock options or otherwise as compensation, holders who\nhold their Cvent common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, U.S. holders\n(as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, real estate investment trusts, regulated\ninvestment companies, holders deemed to sell their shares of Cvent common stock under the constructive sale\nprovisions of the Code, persons who own (directly, indirectly or constructively) an equity interest in Parent or the\nsurviving corporation and holders who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger under the DGCL.\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Cvent common stock,\nthe tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and activities of\nthe partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership holding Cvent common stock or a partner of a partnership\nholding Cvent common stock, you are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the Merger relevant to you.\nThis discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax advice. Holders of Cvent common stock are urged\nto consult their tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them in light\nof their particular circumstances, as well as any tax consequences of the Merger arising under the U.S. federal tax\nlaws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws, \u201cgolden parachute\u201d rules, or under\nany state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or under any applicable income tax treaty.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Cvent common stock that, for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, is:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof\u037e\n77TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\na trust if (a) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and\none or more U.S. persons as described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code have the authority to control all\nsubstantial decisions of the trust or (b) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury\nRegulations to be treated as a United States person (within the meaning of the Code)\u037e and\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Cvent common stock that is, for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, a corporation, a trust or an estate that is not a U.S. holder.\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Cvent common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the Merger\n(determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and such U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in\nthe shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in a share of Cvent common\nstock will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for such share. Such gain or loss generally will be\ncapital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder\u2019s holding period for such shares\nexceeds one year as of the date of the closing. Long-term capital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders,\nincluding individuals, are generally eligible for a reduced rate of federal income taxation. Short-term capital gains are\ntaxed at ordinary income rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss must be\ncalculated separately for each block of Cvent common stock (i.e., common stock acquired at the same time and at the\nsame price in a single transaction). U.S. holders who own separate blocks of Cvent common stock should consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to these rules.\nA U.S. holder may, unless an exception applies, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding\n(currently at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received pursuant to the Merger, unless such U.S. holder\nprovides its correct taxpayer identification number (referred to as the \u201cTIN\u201d) on IRS Form W-9 (or if appropriate, a\nsubstitute or successor form) and certifies under penalties of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such U.S.\nholder is not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, any amounts\nwithheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income\ntax liability, if any\u037e provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner and\nother requirements are satisfied.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nAny gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the Merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject\nto U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and,\nif required by an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the\ncase of an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which case\nthe non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S. holder and, if\nthe non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such corporation may be subject to branch profits tax at the\nrate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on earnings and\nprofits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) effectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness, subject to certain adjustments\u037e\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or\nmore in the taxable year of the Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S.\nholder generally will be subject to a 30% tax (or tax at such lower rate as may be specified under an\napplicable income tax treaty) on the non-U.S. holder\u2019s net gain realized in the Merger, which may be offset\nby certain U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder, if any (even though the individual is not\nconsidered a resident of the United States), provided that such non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal\nincome tax returns with respect to such losses\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe Company is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes at any time during the shorter of (a) the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger and (b)\nthe non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in Cvent common stock, and, at any time during such period, the non-\nU.S. holder owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of the outstanding Cvent common\nstock. Generally, a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation only if the fair market value of its\nU.S. real\n78\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nproperty interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property\ninterests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. The Company does not believe\nthat it was and does not expect that it will be a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger.\nA non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup withholding\n(currently at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received by such non-U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger, unless\nsuch non-U.S. holder provides the Payment Agent with an applicable and properly executed IRS Form W-8 certifying\nunder penalties of perjury the holder\u2019s non-U.S. status (and the payor or applicable withholding agent does not have\nactual knowledge or reason to know that the non-U.S. holder is a U.S. person as defined under the Code) or\notherwise establishes an exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available\nunder an applicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the taxing authorities of the country in which the\nnon-U.S. holder resides or is established. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, any amounts withheld\nunder the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a non-U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax\nliability, if any, provided that the non-U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner and\nother applicable requirements are satisfied. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the\napplication of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them.\nTHE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR\nDESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE\nMERGER. THIS SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.\nIN ADDITION, THIS DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH,\nOR ARE CONTINGENT ON, A HOLDER\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, EACH HOLDER\nIS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF\nTHE MERGER TO SUCH HOLDER IN LIGHT OF SUCH HOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES,\nINCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES WITH RESPECT TO ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY STATE,\nLOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

            "text": "General\nUnder the DGCL, you have the right to demand appraisal and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your\nshares of Cvent common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, as\ndetermined by the Court, in lieu of the consideration you would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement, subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL described herein. These\nrights are known as appraisal rights. Stockholders and beneficial owners electing to exercise appraisal rights must\ncomply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the\nstatutory procedures is required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.\nThis section is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights.\nThe following discussion, however, is not a complete summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the\nDGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is accessible at the following\npublicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and incorporated by\nreference herein. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to \u201cstockholder\u201d (and all references\nin this summary to \u201cholder\u201d) are to the record holder of the shares of Cvent common stock immediately prior to the\nEffective Time as to which appraisal rights are asserted. All references within Section 262 of the DGCL and this\nsummary to \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d mean the beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held either in voting trust\nor by a nominee on behalf of such person. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of\nthe DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. The following discussion does not constitute any legal or other\nadvice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not a Cvent stockholder or beneficial owner should\nexercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nSubject to certain exceptions specified in Section 262 of the DGCL and summarized below, holders and beneficial\nowners of shares of Cvent common stock who: (a) submit a proper written demand for appraisal of such shares to the\nCompany prior to the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (b) do not vote such shares (and ensure that\nsuch shares are not voted) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (c) continuously are the record holders\nor beneficial owners, as the case may be, of such shares through the Effective Time\u037e and (d) otherwise comply with\nthe applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have their shares\nappraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of such shares (as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger) as of the completion of the Merger instead of the Merger Consideration. Any such Cvent\nstockholder or beneficial owner awarded \u201cfair value\u201d for the holder\u2019s shares by the court would receive payment of\nthat fair value in cash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to receive the Merger Consideration. It is\npossible that any such \u201cfair value\u201d as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the\nsame as, that which Cvent stockholders will receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nSection 262 of the DGCL requires that stockholders as of the record date for notice of the Special Meeting to vote on\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less than 20 days\nbefore the Special Meeting. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL or information directing the stockholders to a publicly\navailable electronic resource at which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost must be\nincluded with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to the Company\u2019s stockholders of the\navailability of appraisal rights in connection with the Merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL and a copy of the applicable statutory provisions is accessible at the following publicly available website\nwithout subscription or cost: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.\nStockholders or beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights or who wish to preserve the right to do so\nshould review the following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully. Failure to comply with the\nprocedures of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights. In\naddition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Company unless\ncertain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the Cvent stockholders and beneficial owners seeking\nappraisal. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, stockholders and\nbeneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their own legal and financial\nadvisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. A Cvent stockholder who loses his, her,\ntheir or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.\n109TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHow to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights",

            "text": "How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights\nIf you are a Cvent stockholder or beneficial owner and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares\nof Cvent common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:\n\u2022\nYou must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement\nat the Special Meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any\nproxy or vote abstaining from, voting against or otherwise failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement. Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not\nconstitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must\nreasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder of record holding the shares for which appraisal is\ndemanded, the intention of the person to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares and, in case of a demand\nmade by a beneficial owner, must be accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s\nbeneficial ownership of the shares and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct\ncopy of what it purports to be and must provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to\nreceive notices given by the surviving corporation under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on\nthe verified list required by Section 262(f) of the DGCL. A stockholder\u2019s and beneficial owner\u2019s failure to\nmake a written demand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is taken will constitute a\nwaiver of appraisal rights\u037e\n\u2022\nYou must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption of the Merger Agreement with respect\nto such shares. A vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, whether by proxy submitted by\nmail, over the Internet or by telephone or at the Special Meeting, will constitute a waiver of your appraisal\nrights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal.\nA proxy which does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights must effectively revoke that proxy pursuant to one of the means described in this proxy\nstatement\u037e\n\u2022\nYou must continuously hold (in the case of a stockholder demanding appraisal) or beneficially own (in the\ncase of a beneficial owner demanding your appraisal) your shares of Cvent common stock from the date of\nmaking the demand through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you are a stockholder\nof record and transfer the shares, of if you are a beneficial own and cease to beneficially own such shares,\nbefore the Effective Time\u037e\n\u2022\nAny stockholder or beneficial owner who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL or\nthe Company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair\nvalue of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Company is under no obligation to file any\npetition and has no present intention of doing so\u037e and\n\u2022\nYou must otherwise comply with the applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the\nDGCL.\nIf you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the\nMerger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Cvent common stock.\nIn addition, because Cvent\u2019s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange and is expected to continue to\nbe listed on such exchange immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares of Cvent common stock, unless (a) the total number of shares\nentitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Cvent common stock eligible for appraisal or (b) the\nvalue of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1\nmillion. We refer to conditions (a) and (b) as the \u201cownership thresholds.\u201d At least one of the ownership thresholds\nmust be met in order for Company stockholders to be entitled to seek appraisal with respect to such shares of Cvent\ncommon stock.\nVoting, via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote\non the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by Section\n262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal is in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote. However,\nyou must not vote your shares via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy in favor of the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement in order to exercise your appraisal rights with respect to such shares.\n110TABLE OF CONTENTS",

In that case,\nthe written demand should state the number of shares of Cvent common stock as to which appraisal is sought.\nWhere no number of shares of Cvent common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all\nshares of Cvent common stock held in the name of the holder of record or beneficially owned by the beneficial owner.\nIf you own shares of Cvent common stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in\ncommon, demand for appraisal should be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent,\nincluding an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record\u037e\nhowever, the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the\ndemand, such person is acting as an agent.\nIf you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand\nto:\nCvent Holding Corp.\n1765 Greensboro Station Place, 7th Floor\nTysons, Virginia 22102\nAttention: General Counsel and Corporate Secretary\nSurviving Corporation\u2019s Actions After Completion of the Merger",

In addition, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder or beneficial owner without the approval of the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, which approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\n(including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Delaware Court of Chancery made\nwith respect to the allocation of the expenses of the proceeding)\u037e provided, however, that this provision will not\naffect the right of any Cvent stockholder or beneficial owner that has made an appraisal demand but who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s or\nbeneficial owner\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the Merger\nwithin 60 days after the Effective Time. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, either a record holder or a beneficial\nowner of Cvent common stock, provided such person has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL\nand is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the surviving corporation must commence an appraisal proceeding by\nfiling a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a\npetition filed by a stockholder or beneficial owner, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of Cvent\ncommon stock held by all persons who have properly demanded appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no\nobligation to file an appraisal petition and has no present intention of doing so. If you desire to have your shares\nappraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time\nperiods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\n111TABLE OF CONTENTS\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder or beneficial owner who has complied with the provisions\nof Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a\nstatement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Cvent common stock not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and with respect to which Cvent has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of holders or beneficial owners holding or owning those shares (for which purpose the record holder of\nshares held by a beneficial owner who has made a demand for appraisal shall not be considered a separate\nstockholder holding such shares). The surviving corporation must give this statement to you within the later of (a)\nten days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the request therefor or (b) ten days after expiration of the period\nfor delivery of demands for appraisal.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record or beneficial owner of Cvent common stock\nwho has properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the\nDGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be\nobligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwith a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders and beneficial owners who have demanded\nan appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the\nsurviving corporation. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine which stockholders and beneficial\nowners are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the persons demanding appraisal for their shares represented\nby certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of\nthe appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any such person\nwho fails to comply with this direction. The Delaware Court of Chancery will also dismiss proceedings as to all Cvent\nstockholders and beneficial owners if neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met. Where\nproceedings are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal is not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding\nwill be conducted as to the shares of Cvent common stock for which the applicable stockholders and beneficial\nowners thereof are entitled to appraisal, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including\nany rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the\nfair value of such shares of Cvent common stock at the Effective Time, exclusive of any element of value arising from\nthe accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any. Unless the Delaware Court of\nChancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the\ndate of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time\nand the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any point prior to the\nDelaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each\nperson entitled to appraisal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, if the surviving\ncorporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL, interest will\naccrue thereafter only on the sum of (a) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation\nin such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\nand (b) interest accrued on the amount of the voluntary cash payment before such payment was made, unless such\ninterest was paid at the time the voluntary cash payment is made. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court\nof Chancery will direct the payment of such value, less any amounts already paid in a voluntary cash payment, with\ninterest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same. Payment shall be so made to each such person\nupon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order.\nIn determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining\nfair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally\nconsidered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered and that\n\u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d\nThe Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider\nmarket value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which\nwere known, or which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of\nthe merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware\nSupreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of\nvalue,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or\n112\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexpectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that \u201celements\nof future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nmerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nYou should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Cvent common stock as determined under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of\nthe Merger Agreement and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of\nview of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value\nunder Section 262 of the DGCL.\nMoreover, neither Cvent nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per share price to any Cvent stockholder or\nbeneficial owner exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to\nsubsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section\n262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Cvent common stock is less than the per share price. No representation is made as\nto the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nIf no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time or if neither of the ownership\nthresholds above has been satisfied in respect of such shares, then all Cvent stockholders and beneficial owners will\nlose the right to an appraisal and will instead receive the per share price described in the Merger Agreement, without\ninterest thereon.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may tax those costs to the\nparties as the Delaware Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of\nany person whose name appears on the verified list filed by the surviving corporation who participated in the\nproceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion\nof such, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged\npro rata against the value of all shares of Cvent common stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section\n262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such and award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the\nDGCL. In the absence of such an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses of its\nattorneys and experts.\nIf you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after the\nEffective Time, vote the shares subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions\non those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of Cvent common stock as of a\nrecord date prior to the Effective Time.\nIf you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may withdraw\na demand for appraisal and accept the per share price by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal\nand an acceptance of the Merger to the surviving corporation within 60 days after the Effective Time. No appraisal\nproceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder or beneficial owner without\nthe approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, which may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems just (including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery made with respect to the allocation of the expenses of the proceeding)\u037e provided, however, that\nthis provision will not affect the right of any Cvent stockholder or beneficial owner that has made an appraisal\ndemand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to\nwithdraw such stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger\nConsideration offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If you fail to perfect, successfully\nwithdraw your demand for appraisal, or lose the appraisal right, your shares of Cvent common stock will be converted\ninto the right to receive the per share price, without interest thereon.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of\nyour appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your shares of Cvent\ncommon stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement without interest. In view of the complexity of the provisions\nof Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a Cvent stockholder or beneficial owner and are considering exercising your\nappraisal rights under the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and financial advisor.\nThe process of demanding and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with the prerequisites of Section\n262 of the DGCL. If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are urged to consult with your own legal and\nfinancial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. To the extent there are any\ninconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL will govern.\n113\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHOUSEHOLDING",

            "text": "FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS\nIn light of the pending Merger, Cvent has not scheduled a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. If the Merger is\ncompleted, Cvent will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and will no longer have public stockholders, and\nfollowing the Effective Time, you will no longer be entitled to attend and participate in any future annual meetings of\nour stockholders. However, if the Merger is not completed, you will continue to be entitled to notice of, and may\nattend and participate in, our annual meetings of stockholders, provided that you own Cvent common stock as of the\nclose of business on the record date for such meeting. If Cvent holds a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, we will\nprovide notice of, or otherwise publicly disclose, the date on which the 2023 annual meeting will be held. If we have\npublic stockholders at the time of our 2023 annual meeting, the following deadlines will apply to the submission of\nstockholder proposals, including director nominations.\nCvent stockholders who wish to submit proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act for inclusion in\nour proxy statement and form of proxy for an annual meeting of our stockholders are required to submit proposals in\nwriting to us, and the proposal must be received at our principal executive offices, 1765 Greensboro Station Place, 7th\nFloor, Tysons, Virginia 22102, no later than 120 days prior to the date of the proxy statement for the preceding year\u2019s\nannual meeting of stockholders and follow the other procedures required by Rule 14a-8 and our Bylaws. However, if\nthe date of our annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days before or after the first anniversary date of the\npreceding year\u2019s annual meeting, then the proposal must be received by Cvent a reasonable time before we begin to\nprint and mail our proxy materials for the annual meeting.\nCvent stockholders who wish to nominate persons for election to the Cvent Board or bring forth other business at an\nannual meeting of our stockholders (other than a stockholder proposal submitted for inclusion in our proxy statement\nand form of proxy pursuant to Rule 14a-8) must deliver written notice to the Corporate Secretary at our principal\nexecutive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year\u2019s\nannual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting is scheduled for more than 30 days\nbefore, or more than 70 days following, such anniversary date, then the Corporate Secretary must receive the written\nnotice not later than the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual\nmeeting is first made by us. Any director nomination or stockholder proposal must also contain the information and\ncomply with the requirements set out in our Bylaws. In addition, to comply with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act\n(the universal proxy rules), stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees, other than\nCvent\u2019s nominees, must also provide written notice to the Corporate Secretary that sets forth all of the information\nrequired by Rule 14a-19(b) and must be postmarked or transmitted electronically to Cvent at its principal executive\noffices by the later of (a) the sixtieth day prior to the date of the annual meeting of stockholders, and (b) the tenth day\nfollowing the date on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made by us.\nA copy of the provisions in our Bylaws governing the notice and other requirements set forth above may be\nrequested, at no cost, by writing to our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Cvent Holding Corp., 1765\nGreensboro Station Place, 7th Floor, Tysons, Virginia 22102.\n115TABLE OF CONTENTS\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION",

The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the\nMerger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value\n$0.0001 per share, of the Company (\u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the\neffective time of the Merger, other than (a) Owned Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger\nAgreement), and (b) Dissenting Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), will be cancelled\nand converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $8.50, without interest thereon (the \u201cPer Share\nPrice\u201d). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Per Share Price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance\nwith, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or\nany affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated March\n13, 2023 (the \u201cDraft Merger Agreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial\nstatements and other business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-\nlooking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial\nprojections and operating data of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d). Additionally, we discussed the past\nand current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the\nCompany. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and\ncompared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock\nwith that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the\nfinancial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other\nanalyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed\nwith, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the\nCompany, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of Directors of the Company,\nthat they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of\nthe management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered\nthereby. We have assumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the final\nexecuted Merger Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the\nDraft Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have assumed that in connection\nwith the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or\nrestrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected\nto be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or\nliabilities\nOne Maritime Plaza | 24 Floor | San Francisco, CA 94111 \nTel: 415.844.7700 | www.qatalyst.com | Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\n(contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or\nappraisal. In addition, we have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of\nthe Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with\nsuch technology and products.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our\nservices a portion of which will become payable upon rendering of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger\nfee if the Merger is consummated and may receive an additional, smaller fee from the Company upon consummation\nof the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities\narising out of our engagement.

(\u201cBlackstone\u201d), an affiliate of Parent, on the other hand, pursuant to which compensation was\nreceived by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except Qatalyst Partners acted as a financial advisor to Datto Holding\nCorp., a portfolio company of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC (\u201cVista Equity Partners\u201d), in connection with\nits announced transaction involving Kaseya Holdings Inc. and Kaseya Inc.
