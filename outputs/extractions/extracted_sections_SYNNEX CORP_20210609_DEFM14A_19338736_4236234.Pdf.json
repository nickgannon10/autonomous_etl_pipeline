These amounts will be funded through some or all of (i) the term loan portion of the\ntakeout facility (defined below), (ii) cash on hand and (iii) the proceeds that SYNNEX intends to obtain from other financings or offerings of debt\nsecurities in lieu of borrowing under the Tranche C of the Bridge Facility (as defined below). Remaining amounts under the takeout facility will be\nused for general corporate purposes.\nTo provide the debt financing required by SYNNEX to consummate the Merger, SYNNEX entered into:\n(1) a commitment letter dated March 22, 2021 (which, as it may be amended from time to time, we refer to as the \u201cBridge Commitment Letter\u201d), under\nwhich Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (which we refer to as \u201cCiti\u201d) and certain other financing institutions joining thereto pursuant to the terms\nthereof committed to provide $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured term bridge loans and $3.5 billion in aggregate principal\namount of senior unsecured revolving credit commitments, the availability of which was and is subject to reduction upon the consummation of the\nPermanent Financing (as defined below) pursuant to the terms set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter (which we refer to as the \u201cBridge Facility\u201d).\nThe Bridge Facility originally consisted of three different tranches of senior unsecured loans: the first tranche (which we refer to as \u201cTranche A\u201d)\nwas for a $1.5 billion senior unsecured term loan\u037e the second tranche (which we refer to as \u201cTranche B\u201d) was for a $3.5 billion senior unsecured\nrevolving credit facility\u037e and the third tranche (which we refer to as \u201cTranche C\u201d) is for a $2.5 billion senior unsecured term loan. On April 16, 2021,\nSYNNEX entered into the takeout facility and pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Commitment Letter, the commitments with respect to Tranche A\nand Tranche B of the Bridge Facility were reduced to zero. As a result of the termination of both Tranche A and Tranche B of the Bridge Facility, only\nTranche C of the Bridge Facility remains outstanding and the debt financing that was previously committed to under Tranche A and Tranche B of the\nBridge Facility will instead be provided under the takeout facility\u037e and\n(2) a credit agreement dated April 16, 2021, the loans and commitments to be provided thereunder (which we collectively refer to as the \u201ctakeout\nfacility\u201d) and the related underlying documentation in respect thereof (which we refer to as the \u201cNew Credit Agreement\u201d), with Citibank, N.A., as\nagent, and the other lenders party thereto, pursuant to which SYNNEX has received commitments for the extension of a senior unsecured revolving\ncredit facility not to exceed an aggregate principal amount of $3.5 billion, which revolving credit facility may, subject to the lenders\u2019 discretion,\npotentially be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $500 million and for the extension of a senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal\namount not to exceed $1.5 billion. The commitments under the takeout facility are subject to customary closing conditions. The borrower under the\ntakeout facility is SYNNEX.\nAt this time, SYNNEX has not yet determined whether Tranche C of the Bridge Facility will be required to be utilized in conjunction with the takeout\nfacility to provide the debt financing required to refinance certain indebtedness required to consummate the proposed transactions because such\ndetermination will be dependent on future market conditions. SYNNEX intends to obtain additional financing or issue debt securities in lieu of\nutilizing Tranche C of the Bridge Facility\u037e however, there is no assurance that such alternative arrangements will be available on acceptable terms or\nat all. If Tranche C of the Bridge Facility is utilized there can be no assurance that any replacement or supplemental financing in lieu of or to refinance\nTranche C of the Bridge Facility will be available to SYNNEX on acceptable terms or at all. SYNNEX\u2019 ability to obtain additional debt financing,\nincluding financing to refinance, replace or supplement Tranche C of the Bridge Facility, will be subject to various factors, including market\nconditions and operating performance.\nThe funding under either the Bridge Commitment Letter or the takeout facility, as applicable, is subject to customary closing conditions, including\nconditions that do not relate directly to the conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement.\nUntil the earlier of the closing or the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance therewith, SYNNEX has agreed to use its reasonable\nbest efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,\n \n6\nTable of Contents\nadvisable and proper in connection with the arrangement, marketing and consummation of the issuance of any debt securities and/or the incurrence\nof any other long-term debt financing by SYNNEX that is reasonably acceptable to SYNNEX and Tiger Parent in lieu of the Financing (which debt\nsecurities and/or other long-term debt financing we refer to herein as the \u201cPermanent Financing\u201d). Furthermore, in the event any funds required to\nsatisfy the transaction uses become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter (defined below) or the\nfinancing agreements, SYNNEX has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain additional funds (which we refer to as the \u201cAlternative\nFinancing\u201d) in an amount sufficient to allow it to satisfy the transaction uses, and to obtain a new financing commitment that provides for such\nfunds on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to SYNNEX and Tiger Parent (which we refer to as the \u201cAlternative Commitment Letter\u201d, and\ntogether with the Bridge Commitment Letter, as the context may require, the \u201cCommitment Letter\u201d). The debt financing contemplated by the\nCommitment Letter is referred to herein as the \u201cFinancing\u201d.\nFor more information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Financing.\u201d\nNo Solicitation (see page 87)",

These questions and answers do not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder of SYNNEX. Please refer to\nthe more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the Annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this\nproxy statement.\n \nQ:\nWhat is the Merger?\n \nA:\nOn March 22, 2021, SYNNEX entered into the Merger Agreement with Tiger Parent, Merger Sub I, and Merger Sub II. A copy of the Merger\nAgreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. The Merger Agreement contains the terms and conditions of the proposed acquisition\nof Tiger Parent by SYNNEX. Under the Merger Agreement, subject to satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of the conditions set\nforth in the Merger Agreement and described hereinafter, Merger Sub I will merge with and into Tiger Parent, with Tiger Parent surviving the\nCorporate Merger. Promptly following the Corporate Merger, Tiger Parent will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II surviving the\nLLC Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX. Such Corporate Merger and LLC Merger are referred to collectively as the \u201cMerger\u201d. The\nMerger is intended to be considered together as a single integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and to qualify as a\n\u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.\n \nQ:\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\n \nA:\nYou are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board with respect to the Merger and other matters to be\nconsidered at the special meeting.

SYNNEX is required to, within two business days after the closing of the Merger, file an\nautomatically effective registration statement registering the resale of such shares. For further information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Merger Consideration.\u201d\n \nQ:\nHow will SYNNEX pay the cash component of the Merger consideration?\n \nA:\nSYNNEX\u2019 obligation to complete the Merger is not conditioned upon obtaining financing. $1.61 billion, less $500 million equity contributed by Tiger\nHoldings before closing will be paid from a combination of cash and/or debt raised as part of the debt offering immediately prior to the closing.\n \n10Table of Contents\nQ:\nWhat equity stake will Tiger Parent\u2019s stockholder hold in SYNNEX immediately following the Merger?\n \nA:\nUpon the completion of the Merger, the number of shares of SYNNEX common stock issuable as a portion of the Merger Consideration will be\n44 million shares, which will result in Tiger Holdings, as sole holder of shares of Tiger Parent\u2019s common stock, holding approximately 45% of the\noutstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock, based on the number of outstanding shares of common stock of SYNNEX as of June 8, 2021.\nFor more details on the calculation of Merger consideration, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Merger Consideration.\u201d\n \nQ:\nWhen and where will the special meeting of stockholders be held?\n \nA:\nThe special meeting of SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders will be held via live webcast on June 30, 2021, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Time.

Abstentions and failure to vote will have the same effect\nas a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal.\nThe proposal to adopt an amendment to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, pursuant to which SYNNEX shall waive the corporate\nopportunity doctrine with respect to certain directors and certain other parties requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock (meaning that of the outstanding shares of common stock, a majority of them must be voted \u201cfor\u201d\nthe proposal for it to be approved). Abstentions and failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Corporate Opportunity\nCharter Amendment Proposal.\nThe proposal to approve an adjournment to the special meeting if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of\nSYNNEX common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on\nsuch matter. In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the shares\nof SYNNEX common stock present, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on such matter may\nadjourn the special meeting to a later date and time. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment Proposal, but a\nfailure to vote or otherwise be present at the special meeting will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal.\n \nQ:\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?\n \nA:\nAfter careful consideration, the Board has unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock and the Merger, are fair\nto, and in the best interests of, SYNNEX and SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, the issuance of shares of SYNNEX\ncommon stock in connection with the Merger and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement,\n(iii) directed that the Merger Agreement, issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Merger and the amendments to the\nSYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation be submitted to SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders for their approval, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the\nstockholders of SYNNEX adopt the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the issuance\nof shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Merger and the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation on the terms\nand subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Share Issuance Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the\nAuthorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal, and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment\nProposal.\nFor a discussion of the material factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Reasons for\nRecommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement.\u201d In addition, with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our\ndirectors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders generally. See\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\n \n12\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nDo I need to attend the special meeting?\n \nA:\nNo. It is not necessary for you to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date,\nyou may vote by mail, by telephone or through the internet, as described in more detail below. If you are a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares, you must\nfollow the voting instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee for your shares to be voted at the special meeting, as\ndescribed in more detail below.\n \nQ:\nHow many shares of SYNNEX common stock need to be represented at the special meeting?\n \nA:\nThe presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock\nrepresenting a majority of the votes which all holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock are entitled to cast constitutes a quorum for the purpose\nof considering the proposals. As of June 8, 2021, there were 51,921,692 shares of SYNNEX common stock outstanding. If you are a stockholder of\nSYNNEX as of the close of business on the record date and you vote by mail, by telephone, through the internet or at the special meeting via the\nvirtual meeting website, you will be considered part of the quorum. If you are a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares of SYNNEX common stock and you\nprovide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will be counted in determining the presence of a\nquorum. If you are a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares of SYNNEX common stock and you do not provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee\nwith voting instructions, then your shares will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum.\nAll shares of SYNNEX common stock held by stockholders that attend the special meeting via the virtual meeting website, or are represented by\nproxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting, regardless of how such shares are voted or whether such stockholders have indicated on their\nproxy that they are abstaining from voting, will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the special\nmeeting may be adjourned.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen if SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders do not approve the Share Issuance Proposal?\n \nA:\nSYNNEX is proposing the Share Issuance Proposal in order to comply with NYSE Listing Rule 312.03, which requires stockholder approval of\ncertain transactions that result in the issuance of 20% or more of the outstanding voting power before the issuance of stock or securities. If the\nShare Issuance Proposal is not approved, the Merger cannot be completed, which may have an adverse effect on SYNNEX\u2019 business and financial\ncondition. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen if SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders do not approve the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation?\n \nA:\nApproval of the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal is a condition to the completion of the Merger. If the Authorized Share Charter\nAmendment Proposal is not approved, the Merger cannot be completed, which may have an adverse effect on SYNNEX\u2019 business and financial\ncondition. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee.\nApproval of the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. In the event that the\nCorporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved, but the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal is approved, the\nSYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, as amended pursuant to the Authorized\nShare Charter Amendment Proposal, shall constitute the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms\nand applicable law. Additionally, in the event the Corporation Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved, substantially the same\nprovisions to waive the corporate opportunity doctrine with respect to certain directors and certain other parties will be included in the Investor\nRights Agreement instead.\n \n13\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat will happen if SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders do not approve the Merger Agreement Proposal?\nApproval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger, and therefore the failure to obtain such approval\nwill have no effect on the Merger.\n \nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\n \nA:\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the Annexes attached to this proxy statement, please\nvote your shares of SYNNEX common stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. You will be entitled to one vote for each share\nof SYNNEX common stock that you owned on the record date.\n \nQ:\nHow do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?\n \nA:\nYou may vote by:\n \n \n\u2022\n submitting your proxy by completing, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it by mail in the enclosed prepaid\nenvelope\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n submitting your proxy by using the telephone number printed on each proxy card you receive\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n submitting your proxy through the internet voting instructions printed on each proxy card you receive\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n casting your vote at the special meeting by following the instructions that will be available on the virtual meeting website during the\nmeeting. If you are a registered holder, your virtual control number will be on your proxy card. If you hold your shares beneficially through a\nbank or broker, you must provide a legal proxy from your bank or broker during registration and you will be assigned a virtual control\nnumber in order to vote your shares during the special meeting. If you are unable to obtain a legal proxy to vote your shares, you will still be\nable to attend the special meeting (but will not be able to vote your shares) so long as you demonstrate proof of stock ownership.\nIf you are submitting your proxy by telephone or through the internet, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on\nJune 29, 2021.\nSubmitting your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet will not prevent you from casting your vote at the special meeting via the\nvirtual meeting website. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet even if you plan to attend the special\nmeeting via the virtual meeting website to ensure that your shares of SYNNEX common stock are represented at the special meeting.\nIf you return your signed proxy card, but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger\nAgreement Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Share Issuance Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Corporate\nOpportunity Charter Amendment Proposal, and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\n \nQ:\nIf my shares are held for me by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, will my bank, broker, trust or other nominee vote those shares for me\nwith respect to the proposals?\n \nA:\nYour bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT have the power to vote your shares of SYNNEX common stock at the special meeting unless\nyou provide instructions to your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. You should instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee\non how to vote your shares with respect to the proposals, using the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. You may be\nable to vote by telephone or through the internet if your bank, broker, trust or other nominee offers these options.\n \n14\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat if I fail to instruct my bank, broker, trust or other nominee how to vote?\n \nA:\nBrokers who hold shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d for a beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on \u201croutine\u201d\nproposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion\nwith respect to the approval of matters determined to be \u201cnon-routine\u201d without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. It is expected that all\nproposals to be voted on at the special meeting are \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters. Broker non-votes occur when a broker or nominee is not instructed by\nthe beneficial owner of shares to vote on a particular proposal for which the broker does not have discretionary voting power.\nIf you are a stockholder of SYNNEX and you do not instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote your shares:\n \n \n\u2022\n your bank, broker, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Merger Agreement Proposal, which broker non-votes, if any, will\nhave the same effect as a vote against such proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n your bank, broker, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Share Issuance Proposal, which broker non-votes, if any, will\nhave no effect on the outcome of such proposal (assuming a quorum is present)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n your bank, broker, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal, which broker\nnon-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote against such proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n your bank, broker, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal, which\nbroker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote against such proposal\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n your bank, broker, trust, or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Adjournment Proposal, which broker non-votes, if any, will have\nno effect on the outcome of such proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present).\n \nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card or after I have submitted my proxy by telephone or through the internet?\n \nA:\nYes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the special meeting. You may revoke your proxy by delivering\na signed written notice of revocation stating that the proxy is revoked and bearing a date later than the date of the proxy delivered to Corporate\nSecretary, SYNNEX Corporation, 44201 Nobel Drive, Fremont, California 94538. You may also revoke your proxy or change your vote by submitting\nanother proxy by telephone or through the internet in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. You may also submit a later-\ndated proxy card relating to the same shares. If you voted by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card, you should retain\na copy of the voter control number found on the proxy card in the event that you later decide to revoke your proxy or change your vote by\ntelephone or through the internet. Alternatively, your proxy may be revoked or changed by attending the special meeting via the virtual meeting\nwebsite and voting at the meeting. However, simply attending the special meeting without voting will not revoke or change your proxy.\n\u201cStreet name\u201d holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to obtain instructions as to\nhow to revoke or change their proxies. If you have instructed a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to vote your shares of SYNNEX common stock,\nyou must follow the instructions received from your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to change your vote.\nAll properly submitted proxies received by us before the special meeting that are not revoked or changed prior to being exercised at the special\nmeeting will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions were provided,\n\u201cFOR\u201d each of the proposals.\n \n15\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?\n \nA:\nIf you receive more than one proxy card, it means that you hold shares of SYNNEX common stock that are registered in more than one account. For\nexample, if you own your shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you\nwill receive, and you will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record\nownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your shares of SYNNEX common stock are voted, you will need to submit your proxies by mailing in\neach proxy card you receive or by telephone or through the internet by using the different voter control number(s) on each proxy card.\n \nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\n \nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of certain disclosure documents to any household at which two or more stockholders reside,\nunless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases,\neach stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. This householding process reduces the volume of duplicate\ninformation and reduces printing and mailing expenses. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of SYNNEX common stock, you may\nhave already received a householding notification. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cHouseholding of Proxy Material.\u201d\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of SYNNEX common stock before the special meeting?\n \nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of completion of the Merger. If you own shares of SYNNEX common stock\nas of the close of business on the record date but transfer your shares prior to the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special\nmeeting.\n \nQ:\nDo I have appraisal rights in connection with the Merger?\n \nA:\nSYNNEX\u2019 stockholders do not have appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.\n \nQ:\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\n \nA:\nWe are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. We currently anticipate that the Merger will be completed in the second half\nof the calendar year 2021, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived. The\nMerger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived). For additional information, see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to the Merger.\u201d\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\n \nA:\nIf the Merger is not completed at any time prior to the effective time of the Merger by mutual written agreement of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent or for\nany other reason, the Merger Agreement will be void and have no effect, and there will not be any liability or obligation on the part of any party,\nexcept that (i) no termination will relieve any party from liability for any Willful Breach, (ii) no termination will affect the obligations of the parties\ncontained in the confidentiality agreement between them, and (ii) certain other provisions of the Merger Agreement, including provisions with\nrespect to the allocation of fees and expenses, including, if applicable, the termination fees described below, will survive such termination.\nWe expect that our management will operate our business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that holders of shares\nof SYNNEX common stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject with respect to their\nownership of SYNNEX common stock. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee.\nFor additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed.\u201d\n \n16\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nAre there any requirements if I plan on attending the special meeting?\n \nA:\nThe special meeting will be held via live audio webcast only because of the public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any stockholder of\nrecord will be able to attend the special meeting by first registering at https://viewproxy.com/synnex/2021sm/htype.asp, where stockholders will\nreceive a meeting invitation by e-mail with a unique join link along with a password prior to the meeting date. Stockholders will be able to listen,\nvote and submit questions during the virtual meeting. Instructions on how to vote during the meeting will be available on the virtual meeting\nwebsite during the meeting.\nIf you are a registered holder, your virtual control number will be on your proxy card. If you hold your shares beneficially through a bank or broker,\nyou must provide a legal proxy from your bank or broker during registration and you will be assigned a virtual control number in order to vote your\nshares during the special meeting. If you are unable to obtain a legal proxy to vote your shares, you will still be able to attend the special meeting\n(but will not be able to vote your shares) so long as you demonstrate proof of stock ownership.\n \nQ:\nWhere can I find more information about SYNNEX?\n \nA:\nSYNNEX files periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

            "text": "Risks Relating to the Merger\nSYNNEX\u2019 stockholders will have reduced ownership and voting interest in and will exercise less influence over management of the combined\ncompany.\nSYNNEX\u2019 stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Board and on other matters affecting SYNNEX. Upon consummation of the\nMerger, each stockholder of SYNNEX will become a stockholder of the combined company with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is\nsmaller than such stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership of SYNNEX immediately prior to the Merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, based on the\nestimated number of shares of common stock of SYNNEX that will be outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Merger, SYNNEX estimates\nthat holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock as of immediately prior to the completion of the Merger will hold, in the aggregate, approximately 55%\nof the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company immediately following the completion of the Merger, and Tiger\nHoldings as of immediately prior to the completion of the Merger will hold, in the aggregate, approximately 45% of the issued and outstanding shares of\ncommon stock of the combined company immediately following the completion of the Merger. Accordingly, SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders will have less\ninfluence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of SYNNEX.\nObtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the Merger.\nThe Merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement, including, including (i) the approval of SYNNEX\u2019\nstockholders will have been obtained, (ii) the SYNNEX common stock issuable as Merger Consideration will have been authorized for listing on the\nNYSE, (iii) the HSR Act Clearance and other required regulatory approvals will have been obtained, and (iv) no law, order, injunction or decree will be in\neffect that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the Merger. No assurance can be given that the required stockholder consents and approvals will be\nobtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the conditions are\nsatisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the consents and approvals. Any delay in completing the Merger could\ncause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that SYNNEX expects to achieve if the Merger is\nsuccessfully completed within its expected time frame. For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to\ncompletion of the Merger, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to the Merger.\u201d\n \n20Table of Contents\nIn order to complete the Merger, SYNNEX and Tech Data must obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such authorizations are not\ngranted, the Merger cannot be completed.\nCompletion of the Merger is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the Merger under the HSR Act and\nother similar antitrust laws in certain other countries as well as certain other applicable laws or regulations and the governmental authorizations required\nto complete the Merger having been obtained and being in full force and effect. Although SYNNEX and Tech Data have agreed in the Merger Agreement\nto use their reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings or obtain the required governmental authorizations,\nas the case may be, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or authorizations will be obtained, and if such authorizations\nare not obtained, the Merger will not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms.\nEither SYNNEX or Tiger Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the Merger is not\ncompleted by December 22, 2021 (which date may be extended to March 22, 2022 under circumstances if certain regulatory approvals have not been\nobtained by December 22, 2021 and then again to June 22, 2022 under such circumstances if such regulatory approvals have not been obtained by\nMarch 22, 2022). In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, SYNNEX may be\nrequired to pay Tiger Parent a termination fee of up to $131,683,200, including certain circumstances in which the Board effects a change of\nrecommendation (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Change of Recommendation\u201d) or under certain circumstances where\nSYNNEX enters into an agreement with respect to (or consummates) a superior proposal following the termination of the Merger Agreement. See the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d for a more complete discussion of the circumstances under which the Merger Agreement\ncould be terminated and when a termination fee may be payable by SYNNEX.\nSYNNEX may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting stockholder approval.\nSYNNEX may determine to waive, in whole or part, one or more of the conditions of its obligations to consummate the Merger. SYNNEX currently expects\nto evaluate the materiality of any waiver and its effect on SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders in light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether\nany amendment of this proxy statement or any re-solicitation of proxies or voting cards is required in light of such waiver. Any determination whether to\nwaive any condition to the Merger or as to re-soliciting stockholder approval or amending this proxy statement as a result of a waiver will be made by\nSYNNEX at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time.\nSYNNEX and Tech Data\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Merger.\nParties with which SYNNEX or Tech Data do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to current or future\nbusiness relationships with us, Tech Data or the combined business. SYNNEX and Tech Data\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption as\ncustomers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with\nparties other than SYNNEX, Tech Data or the combined business. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on the businesses, financial\ncondition, results of operations or prospects of the combined business, including a material and adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated\nbenefits of the Merger. The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger or termination of the\nMerger Agreement.\n \n21\nTable of Contents\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of SYNNEX.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders\u2019 failing to approve the issuance of the SYNNEX common stock in\nconnection with the Merger, the ongoing business of SYNNEX may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed\nthe Merger, SYNNEX would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n \n \n\u2022\n We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and from our customers,\nvendors and employees\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n We may be required to pay Tech Data a fee of up to approximately $132 million if the Merger is not consummated\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n We will be required to pay certain transaction expenses and other costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Merger\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n Matters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our\nmanagement, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to\nus as an independent company.\nThere can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize. If any of those risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect\nSYNNEX\u2019 businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nThe directors and executive officers of SYNNEX have interests and arrangements that may be different from, or in addition to, those of SYNNEX\u2019\nstockholders.\nWhen considering the recommendations of the Board with respect to the proposals described in this proxy statement, SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders should be\naware that the directors and executive officers of SYNNEX have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of SYNNEX\u2019\nstockholders generally. These interests include the continued employment of certain executive officers of SYNNEX by the combined company, the\ncontinued service of certain directors of SYNNEX as directors of the combined company, the treatment in the Merger of outstanding equity, equity-based\nand incentive awards, severance arrangements, other compensation and benefit arrangements, and the right to continued indemnification of former\ndirectors and officers by the combined company.\nSYNNEX\u2019 stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider the recommendations of the Board. The Board was aware of and\nconsidered these interests when it (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the amendments to the\nSYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Merger, and the Merger, are fair to, and in\nthe best interests of, SYNNEX and SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in\nconnection with the Merger, and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (iii) directed that the Merger\nAgreement, issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Merger and the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of\nIncorporation be submitted to SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders for their approval, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of SYNNEX adopt the\nMerger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in\nconnection with the Merger and the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the\nMerger Agreement. The interests of our Board and our executive officers are described in more detail in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\n \n22\nTable of Contents\nSYNNEX and Tech Data may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the Merger.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on SYNNEX and Tech Data employees, including the change in Chief Executive Officer, may have an adverse\neffect on each of SYNNEX and Tech Data separately and consequently the combined business. This uncertainty may impair SYNNEX\u2019 and Tech Data\u2019s\nability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the\npendency of the Merger, as employees of SYNNEX and Tech Data may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business.\nFurthermore, if key employees of SYNNEX or Tech Data depart or are at risk of departing, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and\ndifficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become employees of the combined business, we may have to incur significant costs in\nretaining such individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of\nthe Merger may be adversely affected.\nStockholder lawsuits relating to the Merger have been filed against us, which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger\nfrom being completed.\nStockholder lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. As of June 8, 2021, three such suits have been\nbrought against SYNNEX and the Board. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert\nmanagement time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and\nfinancial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Merger, then that injunction may\ndelay or prevent the Merger from being completed.\nThe proposed acquisition of Tech Data and the incurrence of debt to fund the proposed acquisition of Tech Data may impact our financial position\nand subject us to additional financial and operating restrictions.\nAs of February 28, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of total debt, and as of May 31, 2021 this amount has not materially changed. We expect to incur a substantial\namount of additional debt in connection with the proposed acquisition of Tech Data. We expect that upon completion of the proposed acquisition of\nTech Data and the related financing transactions, our total debt will increase to approximately $4 billion. In addition, we expect to have capacity to incur\nsignificant additional debt in excess of $4 billion to fund our working capital needs and for other corporate purposes. If we are unable to\nraise financing on acceptable terms, we may need to rely on the Bridge Facility, which would result in higher borrowing costs and will have a shorter\nmaturity than those from anticipated, long-term debt financing alternatives. In addition, if we are unable to obtain long-term debt financing on the terms\nwe anticipate, then such alternative long-term debt financing may subject us to higher costs of borrowing, and additional financial and operating\ncovenants, which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. We expect to obtain long term unsecured debt financing in lieu of all or a\nportion of the commitments provided under Tranche C of the Bridge Facility. However, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain such\npermanent debt financing or that it will be on acceptable terms. In addition, we anticipate that as a result of the debt we expect to incur to finance the\nproposed acquisition, our credit and the long term debt financing will be rated by credit rating agencies. Any potential future negative change in our\ncredit ratings may make it more expensive for us to raise long term permanent financing on terms that are acceptable to us or to raise additional capital on\nterms that are acceptable to us, if at all\u037e negatively impact the price of our common stock\u037e increase our overall cost of capital\u037e and have other negative\nimplications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe expected replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate and other interbank offered rates with risk-free rates may have an impact on our\nbusiness.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (which we refer to as the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer\npersuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. As a result, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot\nbe guaranteed after 2021 and\n \n23\nTable of Contents\nit is likely that LIBOR will be phased out or modified by 2023. The FCA and the submitting LIBOR banks have indicated they will support the LIBOR\nindices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. Financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating\nthe phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee (which we refer to as the \u201cARRC\u201d) was tasked with identifying alternative reference rates to replace LIBOR. The Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (which we refer to as \u201cSOFR\u201d) has emerged as the ARRC\u2019s preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by the Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market. Accordingly, the composition and characteristics of SOFR\nare not the same as those of U.S. dollar LIBOR and SOFR is not the economic equivalent of U.S. dollar LIBOR. While SOFR is a secured rate, U.S. dollar\nLIBOR is an unsecured rate. In addition, while SOFR is a backward-looking rate based on an overnight rate, U.S. dollar LIBOR is a forward-looking rate\nthat represents interbank funding for a specified term. In the future, including as a result of the Merger, we may have other debt that is linked to interbank\noffered rates in other currencies that will be phased out and replaced by other alternative reference rates based on local currencies. At this time, it is not\npossible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other alternative reference rates. In addition, it is uncertain what methods of calculating a\nreplacement rate will be adopted generally or whether different industry bodies, such as the loan market and the derivative market, will adopt the same\nmethodologies.\nAs of February 28, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of debt outstanding on facilities with interest rates based on LIBOR, and as of May 31, 2021, this has not\nmaterially changed. Some of our credit facilities include fallback language that seeks to facilitate an agreement with our lenders on a replacement rate for\nLIBOR in the event of its discontinuance or that automatically replaces LIBOR with benchmark rates based on SOFR upon certain triggering events. We\ncannot predict what the impact of any such replacement rate would be to our interest expense. Potential changes to the underlying floating-rate indices\nand reference rates may have an adverse impact on our liabilities indexed to LIBOR and could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict or quantify the time, effort and cost required to transition to the use of new benchmark rates, including with respect to\nnegotiating and implementing any necessary changes to existing contractual agreements, and implementing changes to our systems and processes. We\ncontinue to evaluate the operational and other effects of such changes.\nWe will incur significant transaction and integration-related costs in connection with the Merger.\nWe expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Merger and combining the operations of Tech Data with our operations. We will\nincur significant transaction costs related to the Merger. We also will incur significant integration-related fees and costs related to formulating and\nimplementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude\nof these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Merger and the integration of Tech Data into our business. Although we expect\nthat the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to\noffset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nIf our due diligence investigation of Tech Data was inadequate or if unexpected risks related to Tech Data\u2019s business materialize, it could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 investment.\nEven though we conducted a due diligence investigation of Tech Data, we cannot be sure that our diligence surfaced all material issues that may be\npresent inside Tech Data or its business, or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that\nfactors outside of Tech Data and its business and outside of its control will not arise later. If any such material issues arise, they may materially and\nadversely impact the ongoing business of the combined company and our stockholders\u2019 investment.\nThe lack of a public market for Tiger Parent\u2019s shares makes it difficult to evaluate the value of such shares.\nThe outstanding capital stock of Tiger Parent is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it difficult to\ndetermine the fair market value of Tiger Parent. Because the percentage of\n \n24\nTable of Contents\nSYNNEX\u2019 equity to be issued to Tiger Holdings as the Merger Consideration will be determined based on an exchange ratio set forth in the Merger\nAgreement as a result of negotiations between the parties that will not be adjusted even if there is a change in the value of SYNNEX, it is possible that\nthe value of SYNNEX common stock to be received by Tiger Holdings will be more than the fair market value of Tiger Parent.\nThe opinions rendered to SYNNEX from Duff & Phelps will not reflect changes in circumstances between the dates of such opinions and the\ncompletion of the Merger.\nOn March 16, 2021, Duff & Phelps delivered its Opinion to the Board that, as of the date of the Opinion and subject to and based on the assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered, limitations of the review undertaken and qualifications contained in such Opinion, the consideration to\nbe paid by SYNNEX in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to SYNNEX and its stockholders (without giving effect to any impact of the\nMerger on any particular stockholder other than in its capacity as a stockholder).\nSYNNEX has not obtained, nor will it obtain, an updated opinion regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration as of\nthe date of this proxy statement or prior to the completion of the Merger from Duff & Phelps. Duff & Phelps\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic,\nmonetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Duff & Phelps only as of the date of the opinion and does\nnot address the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, at the time the Merger is completed. Changes in the operations and\nprospects of SYNNEX and Tech Data, general economic, monetary, market and other conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of\nSYNNEX and Tech Data, and on which the opinion of Duff & Phelps was based, may alter the value of SYNNEX or Tech Data or the prices of shares of\nSYNNEX common stock or Tiger Parent\u2019s common stock by the time the Merger is completed. The opinion of Duff & Phelps does not speak as of any\ndate other than the date of such opinion.

Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks including:\n \n \n\u2022\n our ability to successfully combine the businesses of SYNNEX and Tech Data\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n whether the combined businesses will perform as expected\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the reduction of our cash available for operations and other uses and the incurrence of indebtedness to finance the acquisition\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Tech Data.\nIf we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of SYNNEX and Tech Data within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost\nsavings and other benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not\nperform as expected, and the value of our common shares may be adversely affected.\nSYNNEX and Tech Data have operated and, until completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that\nour businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key SYNNEX or Tech Data employees,\nthe disruption of either or both company\u2019s ongoing businesses, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-\n \n25Table of Contents\ncompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed to realize the anticipated benefits\nof the Merger so the combined business performs as expected include, among other things:\n \n \n\u2022\n integrating the companies\u2019 technologies, products and services\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n harmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies,\nprocedures and processes\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n consolidating the companies\u2019 corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n managing the movement of certain businesses and positions to different locations\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n maintaining existing agreements with customers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective\ncustomers and vendors\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n consolidating offices of SYNNEX and Tech Data that are currently in or near the same location.\nIn addition, at times, the attention of certain members of either or both companies\u2019 management and resources may be focused on completion of the\nMerger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each\ncompany\u2019s ongoing business and the business of the combined company.\nThe market price for shares of common stock of the combined company following the completion of the Merger may be affected by factors different\nfrom, or in addition to, those that historically have affected or currently affect the market prices of shares of SYNNEX common stock.\nUpon consummation of the Merger, SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders and Tiger Holdings will both hold shares of common stock in the combined company.\nSYNNEX\u2019 and Tech Data\u2019s businesses differ and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company will be affected by some factors that\nare different from those currently or historically affecting the results of operations of SYNNEX and those currently or historically affecting the results of\noperations of Tech Data. The results of operations of the combined company may also be affected by factors different from those that currently affect or\nhave historically affected either SYNNEX or Tech Data.

            "text": "Risks Relating to Tech Data\nBecause SYNNEX and Tech Data operate similar businesses in similar industries, many of the risks relating to SYNNEX and its business disclosed in\nSYNNEX\u2019 filings with the SEC are applicable to Tech Data and its business as well. This section should be read in conjunction with the risks relating\nto SYNNEX and its business disclosed in SYNNEX\u2019 filings with the SEC.\nTech Data\u2019s ability to earn profit is more challenging when sales slow from a down economy as a result of gross profit declining faster than cost\nreduction efforts taking effect.\nAdverse economic conditions may result in lower demand for the products and services Tech Data sells. When Tech Data experiences a rapid decline in\ndemand for products, Tech Data experiences more difficulty in achieving the gross profit and operating profit it desires due to the lower sales and\nincreased pricing pressure. The economic environment may also result in changes in vendor terms and conditions, such as rebates, cash discounts and\ncooperative marketing efforts, which may also result in downward pressure on Tech Data\u2019s gross profit. As a result, there is pressure to reduce the cost\nof operations in order to maximize operating profits. To the extent Tech Data cannot reduce costs to offset such decline in gross profits, Tech Data\u2019s\noperating profits\n \n27Table of Contents\ntypically deteriorate. The benefits from cost reductions may also take longer to fully realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand\nor changes in vendor terms and conditions. Should Tech Data experience a decline in operating profits or not achieve the planned level of growth in\noperations of previously acquired companies, the valuations Tech Data develops for purposes of its goodwill impairment test may be adversely affected,\npotentially resulting in impairment charges. Deterioration in the financial and credit markets heightens the risk of customer bankruptcies and delays in\npayment. Future deterioration in the credit markets could result in reduced availability of credit insurance to cover customer accounts. This, in turn, may\nresult in Tech Data reducing the credit lines Tech Data provides to customers, thereby having a negative impact on Tech Data\u2019s net sales, gross profits\nand net income.\nTech Data\u2019s competitors can take more market share by reducing prices on vendor products that contribute the most to Tech Data\u2019s profitability.\nThe technology distribution industry is characterized by intense competition, based primarily on product availability, credit terms and availability, price,\neffectiveness of information systems and e-commerce tools, speed of delivery, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of\nproduct lines and training, service and support. Tech Data\u2019s customers are not required to purchase any specific volume of products from Tech Data and\nmay move business if pricing is reduced by competitors, resulting in lower sales. As a result, Tech Data must be extremely flexible in determining when to\nreduce prices to maintain market share and sales volumes and when to allow the sales volumes to decline to maintain the quality of Tech Data\u2019s\nprofitability. Tech Data competes with a variety of regional, national and international wholesale distributors, some of which may have greater financial\nresources than Tech Data.\nTech Data is dependent on internal information and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems, including system security\nbreaches, data protection breaches or other cybersecurity attacks, may negatively impact Tech Data\u2019s business and results of operations.\nCyber-attacks and other tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations\nare constantly evolving and have been increasing in sophistication in recent years. High profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of\nsensitive information have occurred with increasing frequency at a number of major U.S. companies, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack\nthreat and improved data protection methods. In addition, regulations related to data protection, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection\nRegulation (which we refer to as \u201cGDPR\u201d) which took effect in May 2018, create a range of new compliance obligations for Tech Data. While to date Tech\nData has not experienced a significant data loss, significant compromise or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, Tech Data\u2019s\nsystems, those of Tech Data\u2019s customers, and those of Tech Data\u2019s third-party service providers are under constant threat. Cybercrime, including\nphishing, social engineering, attempts to overload Tech Data\u2019s servers with denial-of-service attacks, or similar disruptions from unauthorized access to\nTech Data\u2019s systems, could cause critical data loss or the disclosure or use of personal or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to\nfraudulently induce employees to disclose personally identifiable information or other confidential information which could expose Tech Data to a risk of\nloss or misuse of this information.\nTech Data is dependent on internal information and telecommunications systems, and Tech Data is vulnerable to failure of these systems, including\nthrough system security breaches, data protection breaches or other cybersecurity attacks. If these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss or\nunavailability of data and disruption to Tech Data\u2019s business may have a material adverse effect on Tech Data\u2019s reputation and harm Tech Data\u2019s\nrelationships with vendors and customers. Additionally, these events may lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability from fines,\nincluding in relation to noncompliance with the GDPR, as well as possible litigation and punitive damages. Failures of Tech Data\u2019s internal information or\ntelecommunications systems may prevent Tech Data from taking customer orders, shipping products and billing customers. Sales may also be impacted if\nTech Data customers are unable to access Tech Data\u2019s pricing and product availability\n \n28\nTable of Contents\ninformation. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on Tech Data\u2019s business and results of operations.\nTech Data may not be able to ship products if Tech Data\u2019s third party shipping companies cease operations temporarily or permanently.\nTech Data relies on arrangements with independent shipping companies for the delivery of its products from vendors and to customers. The failure or\ninability of these shipping companies to deliver products or the unavailability of their shipping services, even temporarily, may have an adverse effect on\nTech Data\u2019s business and operating results.\nIf Tech Data\u2019s vendors do not continue to provide price protection for inventory Tech Data purchases from them, Tech Data\u2019s profit from the sale of\nthat inventory may decline.\nIt is very typical in this industry that the value of inventory will decline as a result of price reductions by vendors or technological obsolescence. It is the\npolicy of many of Tech Data\u2019s vendors to protect distributors from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or the vendors\u2019 price\nreductions. Some vendors, however, may be unwilling or unable to pay Tech Data for price protection claims or products returned to them under purchase\nagreements. Moreover, industry practices are sometimes not embodied in written agreements and do not protect Tech Data in all cases from declines in\ninventory value. No assurance can be given that such practices to protect distributors will continue, that unforeseen new product developments will not\nadversely affect Tech Data or that Tech Data will be able to successfully manage its existing and future inventories.\nFailure to obtain adequate product supplies from Tech Data\u2019s largest vendors, or terminations of a supply or services agreement, or a significant\nchange in vendor terms or conditions of sale by Tech Data\u2019s largest vendors may negatively affect Tech Data\u2019s financial condition or results of\noperations.\nA significant percentage of Tech Data\u2019s revenues are from products it purchases from certain vendors, such as Apple, Inc., HP Inc. and Cisco Systems,\nInc. These vendors have significant negotiating power over Tech Data and rapid, significant or adverse changes in sales terms and conditions, such as\nreducing the amount of price protection and return rights as well as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to Tech\nData, may reduce the profit Tech Data can earn on these vendors\u2019 products and result in loss of revenue and profitability. Tech Data\u2019s gross profit could\nbe negatively impacted if it is unable to pass through the impact of these changes to Tech Data\u2019s customers or cannot develop systems to manage\nongoing vendor programs. Additionally, significant changes in vendor payment terms or payment arrangements could negatively impact Tech Data\u2019s\nliquidity and financial condition. Tech Data\u2019s standard vendor distribution agreement permits termination without cause by either party upon 30 days\u2019\nnotice. The loss of a relationship with any of Tech Data\u2019s key vendors, a change in their strategy (such as increasing direct sales), the merger or\nreorganization of significant vendors or significant changes in terms on their products may adversely affect Tech Data\u2019s business.\nTech Data conducts business in countries outside of the U.S., which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that result in losses\nin certain periods.\nApproximately 62%, 58%, 60% and 61% of Tech Data\u2019s net sales during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020\nto June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, respectively, were generated in countries outside of the U.S., which\nexposes Tech Data to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Tech Data may enter into short-term forward exchange or option contracts to hedge\nthis risk. Nevertheless, volatile foreign currency exchange rates increase Tech Data\u2019s risk of loss related to products purchased in a currency other than\nthe currency in which those products are sold. While Tech Data maintains policies to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates, extreme\nfluctuations have resulted in Tech Data incurring losses in some countries. Furthermore, Tech Data\u2019s local competitors in certain markets may have\ndifferent purchasing models that provide them reduced foreign currency exposure\n \n29\nTable of Contents\ncompared to Tech Data. This may result in market pricing that Tech Data cannot meet without significantly lower profit on sales. In addition, Tech Data\nmay be exposed to foreign exchange risk that may occur as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s (which we refer to as \u201cU.K.\u201d) withdrawal from the European\nUnion, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. Brexit may adversely affect global economic and market conditions and could contribute to volatility in the\nforeign exchange markets, which Tech Data may be unable to effectively manage through its foreign exchange risk management program.\nThe translation of the financial statements of foreign operations into U.S. dollars is also impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,\nwhich may positively or negatively impact Tech Data\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the value of Tech Data\u2019s equity investment in foreign countries\nmay fluctuate based upon changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These fluctuations, which are recorded in a cumulative translation adjustment\naccount, may result in losses in the event a foreign subsidiary is sold or closed at a time when the foreign currency is weaker than when Tech Data made\ninvestments in the country. The realization of any or all of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on Tech Data\u2019s financial results.\nNatural disasters, public health crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of Tech Data\u2019s control may negatively impact Tech\nData\u2019s business and results of operations.\nIf any of Tech Data\u2019s facilities or the facilities of its suppliers, service providers, or customers, is affected by public health crises, such as pandemics and\nepidemics\u037e political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict\u037e or other events outside of its control, Tech Data\u2019s business,\noperating results and reputation could suffer. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact the availability of products from Tech Data\u2019s\nsuppliers, consumer and business spending in the impacted regions or globally, which could adversely impact its operating results.\nFor example, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global impact of the COVID-19\npandemic has had a negative effect on the global economy, disrupting the financial markets and creating increasing volatility, and impeded global supply\nchains, including Tech Data\u2019s. Tech Data\u2019s suppliers are experiencing delays in the production and export of their products, and Tech Data has\nexperienced impacts to its freight and logistic operations, including increased costs. Additionally, Tech Data may need to close logistics centers for a\nperiod of time as a result of government mandates or self-imposed health and safety initiatives. While Tech Data has initiated short-term measures to\naddress delays in its supply chain, including advance purchases, such measures may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the effects of the COVID-19\npandemic, and such steps may negatively impact Tech Data\u2019s financial condition.\nThe potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial and credit markets, including impacts on the ability of Tech Data\u2019s customers to obtain\naccess to sources of liquidity, heightens the risk of customer bankruptcies and delays in payment which could result in increased credit losses. Future\ndeterioration in the credit markets could result in reduced availability of credit insurance to cover customer accounts. This, in turn, may result in reducing\nTech Data\u2019s credit lines they provide to customers, thereby having a negative impact on net sales, gross profits and net income. Tech Data\u2019s business\nrequires substantial capital to operate. Tech Data has historically relied upon cash generated from operations, bank credit lines, trade credit from vendors\nand accounts receivable purchase agreements to satisfy capital needs and to finance growth. Significant changes in vendor payment terms or payment\narrangements due to the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact liquidity and financial condition. Tech Data has various committed and\nuncommitted lines of credit, short-term loans and overdraft facilities which are provided on an unsecured, short-term basis and are reviewed periodically\nfor renewal, which may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, financial institutions\u2019 willingness to purchase receivables under accounts\nreceivable purchase agreements may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTech Data cannot at this time accurately predict what effects these conditions will have on its operations, including its ability to execute its business\nstrategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, due to\n \n30\nTable of Contents\nuncertainties including the severity and duration of the pandemic, the effect on its customers and customer demand and the length of the restrictions and\nclosures imposed by various governments\u037e however, it may experience a negative impact to its revenue and earnings from the COVID-19 pandemic in the\nfiscal 2022 or beyond.\nIn addition, certain of Tech Data\u2019s facilities, including its corporate headquarters in Clearwater, Florida, are located in geographic areas that heighten its\nexposure to hurricanes, tropical storms and other severe weather events. Future weather events could cause severe damage to Tech Data\u2019s property and\ntechnology and could cause major disruptions to its operations. Tech Data carries property damage and business interruption insurance\u037e however, there\ncan be no assurance that such insurance would be adequate to cover any losses Tech Data may incur. As such, a hurricane, tropical storm or severe\nweather event may have an adverse effect on Tech Data\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTech Data has international operations which exposes it to risks associated with conducting business in multiple jurisdictions.\nTech Data\u2019s international operations are subject to other risks such as the imposition of governmental controls, export license requirements, restrictions\non the export of certain technology, political instability, trade restrictions, tariff changes, uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of Brexit,\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of laws (in particular related to items such as\nduty and taxation), difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, longer collection periods, the impact of local economic conditions and practices,\nuncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations, and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of\nother jurisdictions.\nThe U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S. and the Chinese government has imposed tariffs on certain products\nimported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that Tech Data purchases from its suppliers. The new tariffs, along with\nany additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S. or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While Tech\nData intends to pass price increases on to its customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. There can be no\nassurance that these and other factors will not have an adverse effect on Tech Data\u2019s business.\nTech Data is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the impact of trade discussions between the U.S. and China and related U.S. security risks\nand export controls. On May 15, 2019, the President of the United States issued an Executive Order that authorized export controls on Chinese entities\ndetermined to be a U.S. security threat. At the same time, the U.S. Commerce Dept. placed certain Chinese companies and their subsidiaries on the U.S.\nEntity List requiring U.S. companies to obtain export licensing approval before providing certain technology. Tech Data holds inventory of products\nimpacted by the recent government action and there is uncertainty relating to the disposition of this inventory due to restrictions that would prevent\npurchasers from updating software on the products in the future. While Tech Data continues to take steps to mitigate its exposure to this situation, if the\nsale of these products is delayed or Tech Data is unable to return or dispose of its inventory on favorable economic terms, Tech Data may incur\nadditional carrying costs for the inventory or otherwise record losses associated with the inventory.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings in the jurisdictions in which Tech Data operates may materially impact its financial position and results of operations.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on the Base Erosion and Profit Sharing Project, and has issued and will\ncontinue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which Tech Data\u2019s tax obligations are\ndetermined in many of the countries in which it does business. Certain countries are evaluating their tax policies and regulations, which could affect\ninternational business and may have an adverse effect on Tech Data\u2019s overall tax rate, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax\ncompliance. For\n \n31\nTable of Contents\nexample, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (which we refer to as \u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d) which\nsignificantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and\nimplementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Additional\nchanges in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are\ninterpreted or enforced, could adversely affect Tech Data\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, while Tech Data\u2019s labor force in the U.S. is currently non-union, employees of certain other subsidiaries are subject to collective bargaining or\nsimilar arrangements. Tech Data does business in certain foreign countries where labor disruption is more common than is experienced in the U.S. and\nsome of the freight carriers Tech Data uses are unionized. A labor strike by a group of Tech Data\u2019s employees, one of its freight carriers, one of its\nvendors, a general strike by civil service employees or a governmental shutdown could have an adverse effect on Tech Data\u2019s business. Many of the\nproducts Tech Data sells are manufactured in countries other than the countries in which its logistics centers are located. The inability to receive\nproducts into the logistics centers because of government action or labor disputes at critical ports of entry may have an adverse effect on Tech Data\u2019s\nbusiness.\nTech Data has incurred substantial indebtedness that may impact its financial position and subject it to financial and operating restrictions,\ndecrease its access to capital, and / or increase its borrowing costs, which may adversely affect its operations and financial results.\nTech Data\u2019s business requires substantial capital to operate and to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that are not financed by trade\ncreditors. Tech Data has historically relied upon cash generated from operations, bank credit lines, trade credit from vendors, accounts receivable\npurchase agreements, proceeds from public offerings of Tech Data\u2019s common stock and proceeds from debt offerings to satisfy Tech Data\u2019s capital needs\nand to finance growth. The incurrence of debt under Tech Data\u2019s senior notes and other credit facilities subject it to financial and operating covenants,\nwhich may limit its ability to borrow and its flexibility in responding to its business needs.\nAs of January 31, 2021, Tech Data had approximately $2.3 billion of total debt. If Tech Data is not able to maintain compliance with stated financial\ncovenants or if Tech Data breaches other covenants in any debt agreement, it could be in default under such agreement. Such a default may allow Tech\nData\u2019s creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross-default provision\napplies. Tech Data\u2019s overall leverage and terms of its financing could, among other things:\n \n \n\u2022\n limit Tech Data\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or for general\ncorporate purposes\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n make it more difficult to satisfy Tech Data\u2019s obligations under the terms of the debt\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n limit its ability to refinance its debt on terms acceptable to Tech Data or at all\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n make it more difficult to obtain trade credit from vendors\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n limit Tech Data\u2019s flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and repurchase shares of its common stock\u037e\nand\n \n \n\u2022\n increase Tech Data\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nChanges in Tech Data\u2019s credit rating or other market factors may increase its interest expense or other costs of capital.\nCertain of Tech Data\u2019s financing instruments involve variable rate debt, thus exposing it to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. In addition, the\ninterest rate payable on the 2022 senior notes and the 2027 senior\n \n32\nTable of Contents\nnotes and certain other credit facilities would be subject to adjustment from time to time if Tech Data\u2019s credit rating is downgraded. The U.K.\u2019s Financial\nConduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun\npublishing SOFR, which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. At\nthis time, Tech Data cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to LIBOR or the\ndiscontinuation of LIBOR. If LIBOR is no longer available or if Tech Data\u2019s lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, Tech Data may\nexperience potential increases in interest rates on its variable rate debt, which could adversely impact its interest expense, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nTech Data cannot predict what losses it might incur in litigation matters, regulatory enforcement actions and contingencies that it may be involved\nwith from time to time.\nTech Data cannot predict what losses it might incur from litigation matters, regulatory enforcement actions and contingencies that it may be involved with\nfrom time to time. There are various other claims, lawsuits and pending actions against Tech Data. From time to time, Tech Data is involved in various\nlegal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations relating to its business, which may include claims with respect to\nantitrust, mergers and acquisitions and other matters. In the ordinary course of business, Tech Data also receives inquiries from and has discussions with\ngovernment entities regarding the compliance of its contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations. These matters can be time-consuming,\ndivert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause Tech Data to incur significant expenses. Allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal\nproceedings may also harm Tech Data\u2019s reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims. Furthermore, because litigation and the outcome\nof regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, Tech Data\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by an\nunfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations. Tech Data does not expect that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position. However, the resolution of certain of these matters could be\nmaterial to its operating results for any particular period. Tech Data can make no assurances that it will ultimately be successful in its defense of any of\nthese matters.\nRisks Relating to SYNNEX",

In addition to the strategic factors summarized above, the Board also considered the following factors in\nconnection with its evaluation of the Merger, all of which it viewed as supporting its decision to approve the Merger and make its recommendations to\nSYNNEX\u2019 stockholders:\n \n \n\u2022\n the results of the due diligence investigation of Tech Data and its business, including with respect to legal, accounting, tax and human\nresources matters, conducted by SYNNEX and its advisors\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n historical information concerning SYNNEX\u2019 and Tech Data\u2019s respective businesses, financial condition, results of operations, earnings,\ntrading prices, technology positions, managements, competitive positions and prospects on a stand-alone basis and forecasted combined\nbasis\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the review by the Board with its advisors of the structure of the Merger and the financial and other terms of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the current and prospective business environments and industries in which SYNNEX and Tech Data operate, including international,\nnational and local economic conditions, the competitive and regulatory environment, and the likely effect of these factors on SYNNEX and\nthe combined company\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the support for the Merger received from SYNNEX\u2019 customers and vendors\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the recommendation of SYNNEX\u2019 senior management in favor of the Merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n that SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders will own approximately 55% of the common stock of the combined company upon completion of the Merger,\nwith the remainder to be owned by Apollo\u037e\n \n56\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n the agreed composition of the board of directors and certain senior management of the combined company, including that SYNNEX will\ninitially appoint six of the 11 members of such board of directors, Dennis Polk, our Chief Executive Officer, will initially be the executive chair\nof the combined company, Rich Hume, the current Chief Executive Officer of Tech Data, will initially be the Chief Executive Officer and a\nboard member of the combined company, and Apollo will appoint a number of directors to the board of the directors of the combined\ncompany depending on its ownership of the combined company (which shall initially be four directors)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the fact that SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders must approve the Share Issuance Proposal and the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the agreement of the Major Stockholders to vote their shares in favor of the Merger\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the terms of the Commitment Letter and the Bridge Facility thereunder, based on the then-current market for such commitments and facilities.\nOpinion of Duff & Phelps, LLC. The Board considered the Opinion of Duff & Phelps to the effect that, as of the date of the Opinion and subject to and\nbased on the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, limitations of the review undertaken and qualifications contained in such\nOpinion, the consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to SYNNEX and its stockholders, as more fully\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Opinion of Duff & Phelps, LLC\u201d and Annex F to this proxy statement.\nNegotiations with Tech Data on the Merger Agreement. The Board considered that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (which are\ndescribed in more detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u201d), taken as a whole, including the parties\u2019 representations,\nwarranties and covenants, and the circumstances under which the Merger Agreement may be terminated, in its belief, are reasonable. The Board also\nreviewed and considered the conditions to the completion of the Merger, and concluded that while the completion of the Merger is subject to various\nregulatory approvals, such approvals were likely to be satisfied on a timely basis.\nTiming of Completion. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and\nthe structure of the transaction as a Merger and concluded that the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner. The\nBoard also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the period during which SYNNEX\u2019 business would\nbe subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered certain risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement, including:\n \n \n\u2022\n the significant dilution associated with the stock issuance\u037e the risk that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all,\nas a result of a failure to satisfy certain conditions, including the approval by SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders and the condition requiring the\nexpiration or termination of the waiting period (or any extension thereof, including any agreement between a party and a governmental\nauthority not to consummate the transaction before a certain date) under the HSR Act and the making or receipt, respectively, of certain\nrequired regulatory filings and consents\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the potential length of the regulatory approval process and the period of time during which SYNNEX may be subject to the Merger\nAgreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the possibility that governmental authorities might seek to require certain actions of SYNNEX or Tech Data or impose certain terms,\nconditions or limitations on SYNNEX\u2019 or Tech Data\u2019s businesses in connection with granting approval of the Merger or might otherwise\nseek to prevent or delay the Merger, including the risk that governmental authorities might seek an injunction\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the Merger and the substantial time and effort of\nmanagement required to complete the transactions contemplated by the\n \n57\nTable of Contents\n \nMerger Agreement and the subsequent integration of the businesses, which may disrupt SYNNEX\u2019 business operations\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the fact that SYNNEX will be subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its businesses during the period between signing the Merger\nAgreement and completion of the Merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the risks and contingencies related to the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nincluding the impact on SYNNEX\u2019 employees and its relationships with existing and prospective customers, suppliers and other third\nparties\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the requirement that SYNNEX pay Tiger Parent a termination fee of up to $131,683,200 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain\ncircumstances\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the risk that the potential benefits of the Merger may not be fully realized, including the possibility that synergies, cost savings, growth\nopportunities and operating efficiencies expected to result from the Merger may not be realized to the extent or on the timeline expected, or\nat all\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the fact that SYNNEX intends to waive the corporate opportunity doctrine with respect to Apollo directors, subject to certain exceptions\nwith respect to direct competitors of SYNNEX\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the risks inherent in the business of each of SYNNEX and Tech Data\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the risk that certain key members of senior management of SYNNEX or Tech Data might not choose to remain with the combined company\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n changes in Board composition and potential changes in management\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the fact that Apollo may have significant influence on the combined company following the Merger, including an ability to effectively\nprevent actions that require approval of SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the fact that SYNNEX\u2019 directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different from, and in addition to, those of\nSYNNEX\u2019 stockholders (See \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d)\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the other risks described under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d (including those incorporated by reference in this proxy statement) and \u201cCautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe Board considered all of these factors as a whole and, on balance, concluded that it supported a favorable determination to enter into the Merger\nAgreement.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors\nconsidered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these\nmatters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching\nits determination. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific\ndetermination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination.\nThe Board based its determination on the totality of the information presented, including the factors described above. The factors, potential risks and\nuncertainties contained in this explanation of SYNNEX\u2019 consideration of the factors supporting the Merger and other information presented in this\nsection contain information that is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in \u201cCautionary Statement\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nTech Data Historical Quarterly Information\nIn connection with the Merger, Tiger Parent provided certain historical quarterly information (which we refer to as the \u201cQuarterly Information\u201d) to\nSYNNEX. The Quarterly Information was provided to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the proposed transaction and to help the Board and\nSYNNEX\u2019 management better understand the trends in Tech Data\u2019s business.\n \n58\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a summary of the Quarterly Information (unaudited) for each of the quarters as listed below:\n \n(Dollars in millions)\n \nQ 1\n  \nQ 2\n  \nQ 3\n  \nQ 4\n  \nFY\u201920   \nQ 1\n  \nQ 2\n  \nQ 3\n  \nQ 4\n  \nFY\u201921\n \nTech Data revenue (consolidated)\n $ 8,406  $ 9,092  $ 9,119  $ 10,381  $ 36,998  $ 8,175  $ 8,229  $ 9,016  $ 10,952  $ 36,372 \nTech Data Adj.

Such adjustments were made by SYNNEX\u2019 management in light of, among other things, the due diligence SYNNEX\nconducted on Tech Data, certain macroeconomic, industry and competitive trends, as well as to reflect a more conservative view of Tech Data\u2019s potential\nperformance.\nThe SYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data Projections reflected SYNNEX\u2019 management\u2019s best estimates as to Tech Data\u2019s future performance. The SYNNEX\nAdjusted Tech Data Projections were provided to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the proposed transaction and were also provided to\nDuff & Phelps for purposes of their financial analyses and opinion.

These estimates included\n$100 million in synergies by the end of Year 1 and $200 million in synergies by the end of Year 2. This information was provided to the Board in\nconnection with its evaluation of the proposed transaction.\nThe estimated potential synergies resulting from the Merger and the potential synergies of the combined business overall following the Merger, as\nprepared by SYNNEX management, are referred to herein as the \u201cSYNNEX Synergies\u201d.\nThe SYNNEX Synergies reflect numerous assumptions and reflected SYNNEX\u2019 management\u2019s best estimates as to the potential synergies of a combined\ncompany, which SYNNEX made in good faith. The SYNNEX Synergies were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy\nstatement only because such information was provided, to the Board and, with respect to the potential synergies resulting from the Merger, to Duff &\nPhelps for the purpose of its financial analyses and opinion. The SYNNEX Synergies are not reflected in the SYNNEX financial projections or the\nSYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data Projections.\nGeneral\nThe SYNNEX Financial Projections, SYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data Projections, and SYNNEX Synergies (which we collectively refer to as the \u201cSYNNEX\nProjections\u201d), and the Tech Data Projections and Quarterly Information were prepared by SYNNEX\u2019 management or Tech Data\u2019s management for internal\nuse and were not prepared with a view to public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC,\nthe guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of projections or generally\naccepted accounting principles.

Phelps\u2019 Opinion cannot and should not be relied upon. Furthermore, in Duff & Phelps\u2019 analysis and in connection with the preparation of its\nOpinion, Duff & Phelps made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, market and economic conditions and other\nmatters, many of which are beyond the control of any party involved in the Merger.\nDuff & Phelps prepared its Opinion effective as of the date thereof. Its Opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic, financial and other\nconditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date thereof, and Duff & Phelps disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise any\nperson of any change in any fact or matter affecting its Opinion which may come or be brought to the attention of Duff & Phelps after the date thereof.\nDuff & Phelps did not evaluate Tech Data\u2019s solvency or conduct an independent appraisal or physical inspection of any of Tech Data\u2019s specific assets or\nliabilities (contingent or otherwise). Duff & Phelps was not requested to, and did not, (i) initiate any discussions with, or solicit any indications of interest\nfrom, third parties with respect to the Merger, the assets, businesses or operations of Tech Data, or any alternatives to the Merger, (ii) negotiate the terms\nof the Merger, and therefore, Duff & Phelps assumed that such terms were the most beneficial terms, from SYNNEX\u2019 perspective, that could, under the\ncircumstances, be negotiated among the parties to the Merger Agreement and the Merger, or (iii) advise the Board or any other party with respect to\nalternatives to the Merger.\nDuff & Phelps was not expressing any opinion as to the market price or value of SYNNEX common stock (or anything else) after the announcement or the\nconsummation of the Merger. Duff & Phelps\u2019 Opinion should not be construed as a valuation opinion, a credit rating, a solvency opinion, an analysis of\nTech Data\u2019s credit worthiness, as tax advice, or as accounting advice. Duff & Phelps did not make, and assumed no responsibility to make, any\nrepresentation, or render any opinion, as to any legal matter.\nIn rendering its Opinion, Duff & Phelps was not expressing any opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any of SYNNEX\u2019 or\nTech Data\u2019s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger, or with\nrespect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nDuff & Phelps\u2019 Opinion was furnished solely for the use and benefit of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and was not\nintended to, and did not and does not, confer any rights or remedies upon any other person, and was not and is not intended to be used, and may not be\nused, by any other person or for any other purpose, without Duff & Phelps\u2019 express consent. Duff & Phelps has consented to the inclusion of the\nOpinion in its entirety and the description hereof in this proxy statement and any other filing SYNNEX is required to make with the SEC in connection\nwith the Merger if such inclusion is required by the applicable law.

The decision as to whether to proceed with the Merger or any related transaction may depend on an assessment of factors unrelated to the\nfinancial analysis on which the Opinion was based. Duff & Phelps\u2019 Opinion should not be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on the part of Duff &\nPhelps to any party.\nSet forth below is a summary of the material analyses performed by Duff & Phelps in connection with the delivery of its Opinion to the Board. This\nsummary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Opinion, attached hereto as Annex F. While this summary describes the analyses\nand factors that Duff & Phelps deemed material in its presentation to the Board, it is not a comprehensive description of all analyses and factors\nconsidered by Duff & Phelps. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves various determinations as to the most appropriate\nand relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not\nreadily susceptible to partial analysis. In arriving at its Opinion, Duff & Phelps did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered\nby it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Duff & Phelps believes that its\nanalyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it in rendering the Opinion without\nconsidering all analyses and factors could create a misleading or incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its Opinion. The conclusion\nreached by Duff & Phelps was based on all analyses and factors taken as a whole, and also on the application of Duff & Phelps\u2019 own experience and\njudgment.\nThe financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order for Duff & Phelps\u2019 financial analyses to be fully\nunderstood, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial\nanalyses. Considering the data below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and\nassumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Duff & Phelps\u2019 financial analyses\nValuation Methodologies\nIncome Approach (Discounted Cash Flow Analysis)\nThe Income Approach is a valuation technique that provides an estimation of the fair market value of an asset (or business) based on the cash flows that\nan asset (or business) can be expected to generate over its remaining useful life. The Income Approach begins with an estimation of the annual cash\nflows a market participant would expect the subject asset (or business) to generate over a discrete projection period. The estimated cash flows for each of\nthe years in the discrete projection period are then converted to their present value equivalents using a rate of return appropriate for the risk of achieving\nthe projected cash flows. The present value of the estimated cash flows are then added to the present value equivalent of the residual/terminal value of\nthe asset (if any) or the business at the end of the discrete projection period to arrive at an estimate of fair market value.\nFor business valuations, the Income Approach is typically applied through a Discounted Cash Flow (which we refer to as \u201cDCF\u201d) analysis. Under the\nDCF analysis, the valuation is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows for the expected life of the asset (or business) discounted at a\nrate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving those cash flows and the time value of money.\nMarket Approach (Selected Public Companies / Selected M&A Transactions Analysis)\nThe Market Approach is a valuation technique that provides an estimation of fair market value based on market prices in actual transactions and on\nasking prices for assets (or businesses). The valuation process is a comparison and correlation between the subject asset (or business) and other similar\nassets (or businesses). Considerations such as time and condition of sale and terms of agreements are analyzed for comparable assets and are adjusted to\narrive at an estimation of the fair market value of the subject asset.\n \n67\nTable of Contents\nValuation Methodologies Utilized\nIn applying the Income Approach, Duff & Phelps relied on the financial projections, as prepared by Tech Data\u2019s management and reviewed, adjusted and\nprovided to Duff & Phelps by SYNNEX\u2019 management, as the basis for the DCF analysis.\nDuff & Phelps utilized the Market Approach (Selected Public Companies / Selected M&A Transactions Analysis) to select valuation multiples for Tech\nData. Duff & Phelps reviewed the selected public companies\u2019 financial performance and enterprise value to latest twelve months (which we refer to as\n\u201cLTM\u201d) and projected revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which we refer to as \u201cEBITDA\u201d) multiples and the\nselected M&A transactions\u2019 implied enterprise value to revenue and EBITDA multiples when selecting valuation multiples for Tech Data. In the fairness\nanalysis, all references to EBITDA include stock-based compensation expenses. In making these selections, Duff & Phelps considered Tech Data\u2019s size,\ngrowth outlook, capital requirements, profit margins, and other characteristics relative to the selected public companies and the targets in the selected\nM&A transactions.\nIncome Approach (Discounted Cash Flow Analysis) Summary\nDuff & Phelps performed a DCF analysis of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows attributable to Tech Data for the fiscal years ending\nJanuary 31, 2022 through January 31, 2024, with unlevered \u201cfree cash flow\u201d defined as cash that is available either to reinvest or to distribute to security\nholders. The DCF analysis was used to determine the net present value of estimated future free cash flows utilizing a weighted average cost of capital as\nthe applicable discount rate. For the purposes of its DCF analysis, Duff & Phelps utilized and relied upon the SYNNEX Financial Projections, which are\ndescribed in this proxy statement in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Certain SYNNEX Projections.\u201d\nDuff & Phelps estimated the net present value of all cash flows attributable to Tech Data after fiscal year 2024 (which we refer to as the \u201cTerminal Value\u201d)\nusing a perpetuity growth formula assuming a 2.5% terminal growth rate, which took into consideration Duff & Phelps\u2019 estimate of the expected long-term\ngrowth rate of the economy and Tech Data\u2019s business. Duff & Phelps used discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 11.0%, reflecting Duff & Phelps\u2019 estimate\nof Tech Data\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, to discount the projected free cash flows and the Terminal Value. Duff & Phelps estimated Tech Data\u2019s\nweighted average cost of capital by estimating the weighted average of Tech Data\u2019s cost of equity (derived using the capital asset pricing model) and\nTech Data\u2019s after-tax cost of debt. Duff & Phelps believes that this range of discount rates is consistent with the rate of return that security holders could\nexpect to realize on alternative investment opportunities with similar risk profiles. On these assumptions, Duff & Phelps estimates the Terminal Value to be\nin the range of $7.4 billion to $8.4 billion.\nBased on these assumptions, Duff & Phelps\u2019 DCF analysis resulted in an estimated enterprise value for Tech Data of $7.320 billion to $8.250 billion.\nDuff & Phelps further estimated the range of equity value of Tech Data to be $5.482 billion to $6.412 billion by adding pro forma cash of $1.333 billion,\nadding the proceeds from a sale lease back transaction of $0.067 billion, subtracting pro forma debt of $2.412 billion, subtracting a working capital\nadjustment of $0.606 billion, and subtracting the present value of certain restructuring and other expenses of $0.220 billion.\nMarket Approach (Selected Public Companies / Selected M&A Transactions Analyses) Summary\nDuff & Phelps analyzed selected public companies and selected M&A transactions for purposes of estimating valuation multiples with which to calculate\na range of implied enterprise values of Tech Data. This collective analysis was based on publicly available information and is described in more detail in\nthe sections that follow.\nThe companies utilized for comparative purposes in the following analysis were not directly comparable to Tech Data, and the transactions utilized for\ncomparative purposes in the following analysis were not directly comparable to the Merger. Duff & Phelps does not have access to non-public\ninformation of any of the\n \n68\nTable of Contents\ncompanies used for comparative purposes. Accordingly, a complete valuation analysis of Tech Data and the Merger cannot rely solely upon a\nquantitative review of the selected public companies and selected transactions, but involves complex considerations and judgments concerning\ndifferences in financial and operating characteristics of such companies and targets, as well as other factors that could affect their value relative to that of\nTech Data. Therefore, the selected public companies and selected mergers and acquisitions transactions analysis is subject to certain limitations.\nSelected Public Companies Analysis. Duff & Phelps compared certain financial information of Tech Data to corresponding data and ratios from publicly\ntraded companies that were deemed relevant to its analysis. For purposes of its analysis, Duff & Phelps used certain publicly available historical financial\ndata and consensus equity analyst estimates for the selected publicly traded companies. Duff & Phelps analyzed a number of factors in comparing Tech\nData to the selected public companies and the targets in the selected mergers and acquisitions transactions, including historical and forecasted growth in\nrevenue and profits, profit margins and other characteristics that we deemed relevant.

Duff & Phelps compared Tech Data to the target companies involved in the selected merger and acquisition\ntransactions listed in the tables below. The selection of these transactions was based on, among other things, the target company\u2019s industry, the relative\nsize of the transaction compared to the Merger and the availability of public information related to the transaction.\nSummary of Selected Public Companies / Selected M&A Transactions Analyses\nIn order to estimate a range of enterprise values for Tech Data, Duff & Phelps applied valuation multiples to Tech Data\u2019s LTM EBITDA ending January 31,\n2021 and projected SYNNEX Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years ending January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023. Duff & Phelps\u2019 selected valuation\nmultiples were as follows: LTM EBITDA multiple ranged from 9.0x to 10.0x, NTM EBITDA multiple ranged from 8.5x to 9.5x, and NTM + 1 EBITDA multiple\nranged from 8.0x to 9.0x. Valuation multiples were selected taking into consideration historical and projected financial performance metrics of Tech Data\nrelative to such metrics of the selected public companies and selected M&A transactions. Rather than applying the average or median multiple from the\npublic company set, Duff & Phelps selected multiples that, in its judgment, reflected Tech Data\u2019s size, growth outlook, capital requirements, profit\nmargins, revenue mix, and other characteristics relative to the selected public companies and M&A transactions. Based on these analyses, Duff & Phelps\u2019\nselected public companies and M&A transactions analysis resulted in an estimated enterprise value for Tech Data of $7.440 billion to $8.310 billion.\nDuff & Phelps further estimated the range of equity value of Tech Data to be $5.602 billion to $6.472 billion by adding pro forma cash of $1.333 billion,\nadding the proceeds from a sale lease back transaction of $0.067 billion, subtracting pro forma debt of $2.412 billion, subtracting a working capital\nadjustment of $0.606 billion, and subtracting the present value of certain restructuring and other expenses of $0.220 billion.\nSummary of Synergies\u2019 Analysis\nDuff & Phelps performed a DCF analysis on projected cost synergies net of projected dis-synergies after-tax (which we refer to as \u201cNet Synergies\u201d)\nexpected to be realized in connection with the Merger for the fiscal years ending January 31, 2022 through January 31, 2024 as provided in the SYNNEX\nFinancial Projections. Approximately $50 million of cost synergies and $20 million of dis-synergies are expected to be realized in the first fiscal year after\nthe consummation of the Merger and approximately $100 million of cost synergies and $15 million of dis-synergies are expected to be realized in the\nsecond fiscal year after the consummation of the Merger. Duff & Phelps estimated the Terminal Value of all Net Synergies after the fiscal year ending\nJanuary 31, 2024 using a perpetuity growth formula assuming a 2.5%\n \n71\nTable of Contents\nterminal growth rate, which took into consideration an estimate of the expected long-term growth rate of the economy and SYNNEX\u2019 and the Tech Data\u2019s\ncombined business. Duff & Phelps used discount rates ranging from 11.75% to 13.75%, reflecting Duff & Phelps\u2019 estimate of Tech Data\u2019s cost of equity,\nto discount the projected Net Synergies and the Terminal Value of the Net Synergies. Based on these assumptions, Duff & Phelps\u2019 DCF analysis resulted\nin an estimated present value for the Net Synergies of $610 million to $740 million.\nDuff & Phelps added the present value of Net Synergies to its estimate of the range of equity value of Tech Data to estimate the total value to be received\nby SYNNEX in the Merger.\nSummary of Financial Analysis\nBased on Duff & Phelps\u2019 analysis, the concluded range of total value to be received by the Company, excluding the Net Synergies, was estimated to be\n$5.542 billion to $6.442 billion. Based on Duff & Phelps\u2019 analysis, the concluded range of total value to be received by the Company, including the Net\nSynergies, was estimated to be $6.152 billion to $7.182 billion. The total consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger was estimated to be\n$6.127 billion based on the Company\u2019s common share price of $102.67 as of March 12, 2021.\n \nLOGO\nDuff & Phelps noted that the consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger was below the range of the values indicated by its analyses including\nNet Synergies.\nDuff & Phelps\u2019 Opinion was only one of the many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as\ndeterminative of the views of the Board.\nFees and Expenses\nAs compensation for Duff & Phelps\u2019 services in connection with the rendering of its Opinion to the Board, SYNNEX agreed to pay Duff & Phelps a fee of\n$600,000. The fee was payable upon Duff & Phelps informing the Board that it was prepared to deliver its Opinion.\nNo portion of Duff & Phelps\u2019 fee is refundable or contingent upon the consummation of a transaction or the conclusion reached in the Opinion.\nFurthermore, Duff & Phelps is entitled to be paid additional fees at Duff & Phelps\u2019 standard hourly rates for any time incurred should Duff & Phelps be\ncalled upon to support its findings subsequent to the delivery of its\n \n72\nTable of Contents\nOpinion and/or assist in the preparation or review of documents associated with the Merger. SYNNEX has also agreed to reimburse Duff & Phelps for its\nreasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by Duff & Phelps in connection with the\nengagement. SYNNEX has also agreed to indemnify Duff & Phelps for certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.\nThe terms of the fee arrangements with Duff & Phelps, which SYNNEX believes are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arm\u2019s\nlength, and the Board is aware of these fee arrangements.\nDisclosure of Prior Relationships\nDuring the two years preceding the date of its Opinion, Duff & Phelps provided financial opinions and valuation services to SYNNEX, and provided\nvaluation services to Tech Data\u2019s private equity sponsor, Apollo and its affiliates (which we collectively refer to as \u201cApollo\u201d). For these prior\nengagements, Duff & Phelps received customary fees, expense reimbursement, and indemnification. Total fees paid by each of SYNNEX and Apollo were\nimmaterial to Duff & Phelps\u2019 total revenues.\nInterests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger",

These amounts will be\nfunded through some or all of (i) the term loan portion of the takeout facility, (ii) cash on hand and (iii) the proceeds that SYNNEX intends to obtain from\nother financings or offerings of debt securities in lieu of borrowing under the Tranche C of the Bridge Facility. Remaining amounts under the takeout\nfacility will be used for general corporate purposes.\nPursuant to the Bridge Commitment Letter for the Bridge Facility, SYNNEX received commitments for an aggregate principal amount of $7.5 billion in\nfinancing, consisting of $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured term bridge loans and $3.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of\nsenior unsecured revolving credit commitments, the availability of which was and is subject to reduction upon the consummation of the Permanent\nFinancing pursuant to the terms set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter. The Bridge Facility originally consisted of three different tranches of senior\nunsecured loans: Tranche A was for a $1.5 billion senior unsecured term loan\u037e Tranche B was for a $3.5 billion senior unsecured revolving loan\u037e and\nTranche C is for a $2.5 billion senior unsecured term loan. On April 16, 2021, SYNNEX entered into the takeout facility and pursuant to the terms of the\nBridge Commitment Letter, the commitments with respect to Tranche A and Tranche B of the Bridge Facility were reduced to zero. As a result of the\ntermination of both Tranche A and Tranche B of the Bridge Facility, only Tranche C of the Bridge Facility remains outstanding and the debt financing\npreviously committed to under Tranche A and Tranche B of the Bridge Facility are instead committed to be provided under the takeout facility.\nPursuant to the takeout facility, SYNNEX received commitments for the extension of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility not to exceed an\naggregate principal amount of $3.5 billion, which revolving credit facility may, subject to the lenders\u2019 discretion, potentially be increased by up to an\naggregate amount of $500 million and for the extension of a senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. The\ncommitments under the takeout facility are subject to customary conditions. The borrower under the takeout facility is SYNNEX.\nThe commitments under the takeout facility terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) with respect to the revolving commitments, the fifth anniversary of\nthe closing date (subject, to two one-year extensions upon\n \n74Table of Contents\nSYNNEX\u2019 prior notice to the lenders and the agreement of the lenders to extend such maturity date), (ii) in the event SYNNEX voluntarily elects to reduce\nsuch commitments to zero, on such date, or subject to certain conditions, following an event of default, (iii) if the closing does not occur prior to such\ndate, five business days after the termination date of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated by SYNNEX in a\nsigned writing in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nAt this time, SYNNEX has not yet determined whether Tranche C of the Bridge Facility will be required to be utilized in conjunction with the takeout\nfacility to provide the debt financing required to refinance certain indebtedness required to consummate the proposed transactions because such\ndetermination will be dependent on future market conditions. SYNNEX intends to obtain additional financing or issue debt securities in lieu of utilizing\nTranche C of the Bridge Facility, however, there is no assurance that such alternative arrangements will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If\nTranche C of the Bridge Facility is utilized there can be no assurance that any replacement or supplemental financing in lieu of or to refinance Tranche C\nof the Bridge Facility will be available to SYNNEX on acceptable terms or at all. SYNNEX\u2019 ability to obtain additional debt financing, including financing\nto refinance, replace or supplement Tranche C of the Bridge Facility, will be subject to various factors, including market conditions and operating\nperformance.\nThe funding under either the Bridge Commitment Letter or the takeout facility, as applicable, is subject to customary closing conditions, including\nconditions that do not relate directly to the conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement.\nTakeout Facility\nThe proceeds of the loans under the takeout facility will be used to provide a portion of the debt financing required to refinance certain indebtedness of\nSYNNEX and Tech Data, which is required to consummate the proposed transaction, together with the payment of related fees and expenses. After the\nclosing date, the revolving credit facility will, subject to customary conditions, be available for general corporate purposes or any other purpose not\nprohibited by the takeout facility.\nInterest Rate\nThe interest rate per annum applicable to the loans under the takeout facility are, at SYNNEX\u2019 option, equal to either a base rate or a LIBOR (or successor)\nrate plus an applicable margin, which may (in the case of LIBOR loans) range from 1.125% to 1.75%, based on SYNNEX\u2019 public debt rating (as defined in\nthe New Credit Agreement). The applicable margin on base rate loans is 1.00% less than the corresponding margin on LIBOR (or successor rate) based\nloans.\nAmortization and Prepayments\nThe maturity of the take out facility will be five years after the closing date, subject, in the case of the revolving credit facility, to two one-year extensions\nupon SYNNEX\u2019 prior notice to the lenders and the agreement of the lenders to extend such maturity date. Once advanced, the outstanding principal\namount of the term loan under the takeout facility will be payable in equal quarterly amounts equal to 1.25% of the principal outstanding balance,\ncommencing on the last day of the first full fiscal quarter after the closing date, with the outstanding principal amount of the term loans due in full on the\nmaturity date. The term loan portion of the takeout facility is not subject to mandatory prepayment. SYNNEX may prepay all or any portion of the term\nloans under the takeout facility prior to maturity without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of any LIBOR breakage costs of the lenders.\n \n75\nTable of Contents\nConditions to Closing\nThe obligation of the lenders to fund the loans under the takeout facility on the closing date is subject, among other things, to:\n \n \n\u2022\n consummation of the Merger substantially concurrently with the closing and funding of the takeout facility in all material respects in\naccordance with the Merger Agreement, without any amendment or modification thereto which is materially adverse to the interests of the\nlenders under the takeout facilities, who are collectively referred to in this proxy statement as the takeout lenders, unless approved by the\nagent under the takeout facility (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the accuracy of certain limited representations and warranties\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n delivery of historical consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX and Tech Data\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n delivery of pro forma financial statements of SYNNEX and its subsidiaries, after giving effect to the transactions\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the repayment of certain indebtedness of SYNNEX, Tech Data and their respective subsidiaries substantially concurrent with the closing of\nthe takeout facility\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n solvency of SYNNEX and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n since March 22, 2021, no material adverse effect on Tech Data.\nFor more information, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Financing.\u201d\nCertain Covenants and Events of Default\nThe takeout facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default (including relating to a change of control) that are\ncustomary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers. Among other things, such negative covenants restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the\nability of SYNNEX and its subsidiaries, to create liens, incur indebtedness (solely with respect to any non-guarantor subsidiary of SYNNEX), mergers or\nconsolidations, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or change the nature of their business. In addition, the takeout facility contains financial\ncovenants which require SYNNEX to maintain at the end of any of its fiscal quarters commencing with the first full fiscal quarter ending after entry into\nthe takeout facility, (i) a consolidated leverage ratio that may not exceed 4.25 to 1.00 for the first four full fiscal quarters following entry into the takeout\nfacility and 4.00 to 1.00 thereafter, and (ii) an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.50 to 1.00.\nRegulatory Approvals",

The HSR Act provides that each party must file a pre-merger notification with the FTC and the DOJ. A transaction notifiable under the HSR\nAct may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their respective HSR Act notification\nforms or the early termination of that waiting period. This initial waiting period may be extended for an additional 30 days should the acquiring person\nwithdraw its filing before expiration of the initial 30 days and promptly refile it. If the FTC or DOJ issues a Request for Additional Information and\nDocumentary Material prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period (including a re-filing period after withdrawing the initial HSR filings), the parties\nmust observe a second 30-calendar-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the request for\nadditional information, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier. Under the Merger Agreement, completion of the Merger is conditioned on the HSR\nAct Clearance.\nNeither SYNNEX nor Tiger Parent will agree, directly or indirectly, to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable law or to any timing\nagreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other\n \n76Table of Contents\ngovernmental entity, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.\nOn April 2, 2021, SYNNEX and Tiger Parent filed their respective notification and report forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger with the FTC\nand DOJ, which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period. At the end of the initial 30-day waiting period, SYNNEX pulled and re-filed its\nnotification and report form under the HSR Act, with the consent of Tiger Parent, to allow the FTC and DOJ an additional 30 days to review the Merger.\nThis additional 30-day period expired on June 4, 2021. Additionally, the Merger has received clearance for some of the non-U.S. regulatory filings, while\nother non-U.S. regulatory clearances remain outstanding.\nAt any time before or after the Merger is completed, the FTC or DOJ could take action under U.S. federal antitrust laws in opposition to the Merger,\nincluding seeking to enjoin completion of the Merger, condition adoption of the Merger Agreement upon the divestiture of assets of Tiger Parent,\nSYNNEX or their respective subsidiaries or impose restrictions on SYNNEX\u2019 post-Merger operations or other conditions. In addition, U.S. state attorneys\ngeneral could take such action under state antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking\nto enjoin completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory concessions or conditions. Private parties also may seek to take legal\naction under the U.S. federal or state antitrust laws under some circumstances.\nFor a description of SYNNEX\u2019 and Tiger Parent\u2019s respective obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to regulatory approvals, see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Covenant and Agreements\u2014Efforts to Complete the Merger.\u201d\nLitigation Related to the Merger\nBetween May 26, 2021and June 4, 2021, three complaints challenging the Merger were filed.\nJoel Zalvin v. Kevin Murai, et al., No. 21CV-0303, was filed on May 26, 2021 in the Superior Court of California, County of San Luis Obispo. The action\nnames as defendants SYNNEX, Tech Data, and all the members of SYNNEX\u2019 Board.

It alleges that the\npreliminary proxy statement contains material misstatements and omissions regarding the Merger. It seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, including\nenjoining or rescinding the stockholder vote. It also seeks compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\nPatrick Akowuah v. SYNNEX Corp., et al., No. 1:21-cv-04751, was filed on May 27, 2021 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York. The action names as defendants SYNNEX and members of SYNNEX\u2019 Board. It purports to assert claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 thereunder.

Unless the Board has made a change of recommendation as described under the section entitled \u201c\u2014Change of\nRecommendation,\u201d SYNNEX will recommend that its stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Share Issuance Proposal, the Authorized\nShare Charter Amendment Proposal and the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal, and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its\nstockholders proxies in favor of such proposals and take all other action necessary or advisable to obtain such stockholder approval.\nStock Exchange Listing\nSYNNEX has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of SYNNEX common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be\napproved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Merger.\nNo Solicitation\nEach of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent mutually agreed to immediately cease discussions or negotiations with any other person that may have been ongoing\nprior to the date of the Merger Agreement, with respect to any alternative acquisition proposal of SYNNEX or Tiger Parent, as applicable, and to request\nthe return or destruction of any confidential information previously delivered to any such person.\nEach of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent has agreed that it will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and other respective representatives not to, directly\nor indirectly:\n \n \n\u2022\n initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any alternative acquisition proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any alternative acquisition proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with any person relating to any\nalternative acquisition proposal\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n approve or enter into any acquisition agreement, term sheet, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other similar agreement in\nconnection with or relating to any alternative acquisition proposal (unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated).\nIf, prior to the receipt of SYNNEX\u2019 stockholder approval, SYNNEX receives a bona fide written alternative acquisition proposal not solicited in violation\nits non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement,\n \n87\nTable of Contents\nSYNNEX may furnish confidential or nonpublic information to, and participate in such negotiations or discussions with, the person making the\nalternative acquisition proposal, if the Board concludes in good faith, after consulting with such outside advisors as it determines in good faith to be\nreasonably necessary, that taking such actions would be required to comply with its fiduciary duties. Before furnishing any confidential or nonpublic\ninformation, SYNNEX may and shall enter into a confidentiality agreement with the person making such alternative acquisition proposal that contains\nterms no less favorable than the confidentiality agreement between SYNNEX and Tiger Parent (provides that such confidentiality agreement shall not\ngive such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with SYNNEX, and shall otherwise permit SYNNEX to comply with its obligations under the\nMerger Agreement).\nSYNNEX must promptly (within 24 hours) advise Tiger Parent if it has received any alternative acquisition proposal or any inquiry which could\nreasonably be expected to lead to an alternative acquisition proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the identity\nof the person making such inquiry or alternative acquisition proposal). SYNNEX must further provide Tiger Parent with an unredacted copy of any such\nalternative acquisition proposal and any draft agreements or other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or alternative acquisition\nproposal. SYNNEX must keep Tiger Parent apprised of any material developments and negotiations, including any (i) amendment or modification to the\neconomic terms of such alternative acquisition proposal or (ii) any other material amendment or modification to the terms us such proposal.\nFor purposes of the Merger Agreement, an alternative acquisition proposal means, with respect to SYNNEX or Tiger Parent, as applicable (other than the\nMerger contemplated by the Merger Agreement), any proposal or offer from third party, relating to\n \n \n\u2022\n any acquisition of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of a party and its subsidiaries\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n any acquisition twenty percent 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its subsidiaries whose assets,\nindividually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the party\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party or its affiliates beneficially owning 20% or more of\nany class of equity or voting securities of a party or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more\nof the consolidated assets of the party\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar\ntransaction involving a party or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty percent 20% or more of the\nconsolidated assets of the party, which would result in the stockholders of such party prior to such transaction ceasing to own at least 80%,\ndirectly or indirectly, of such party or its subsidiaries.\nChange of Recommendation\nSubject to the following paragraph, the Board may not change its recommendation that SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement Proposal, the Share Issuance Proposal, the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal and the Corporate Opportunity Charter\nAmendment Proposal. Under the Merger Agreement, a change in recommendation will occur if the Board (i) withholds, withdraws, modifies or qualifies in\na manner adverse to Tiger Parent its recommendation, (ii) fails to make its recommendation in this proxy statement, (iii) adopts, approves, recommends or\nendorses an alternative acquisition proposal or publicly announces an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an alternative acquisition\nproposal, (iv) if an alternative acquisition proposal is made public, fails to publicly (and without qualification) disapprove of such alternative acquisition\nproposal or reaffirm its recommendation within 10 business days, or (v) publicly proposes to do any of the foregoing.\n \n88\nTable of Contents\nPrior to obtaining the approval of SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders, the Board may make a change of recommendation (i) in connection with a bona fide, written\nalternative acquisition proposal (with applicable thresholds in the definition of alternative acquisition proposal equal to 80% instead of 25%) that was not\nsolicited in violation of the non-solicitation obligations described above, which the Board determines in good faith (after consulting with such outside\nadvisors as it determines to be reasonably necessary) to be more favorable to SYNNEX and its stockholders than the Merger from a financial point of\nview and is reasonably likely to be consummated, in each case, taking into account all relevant factors (including the terms and conditions of such\nalternative acquisition proposal and the Merger Agreement and any changes to the terms of Merger Agreement proposed by Tiger Parent), which is\nreferred to as a \u201csuperior acquisition proposal\u201d or (ii) in response to a material event, change, effect, development or occurrence, subject to certain\nexceptions relating to regulatory approvals, that was not known to the Board prior to the date of the Merger Agreement and does not relate to or involve\nan alternative acquisition proposal, which we refer to as an \u201cintervening event.\u201d\nPrior to making a change in recommendation, the Board must (i) provide Tiger Parent with four business days\u2019 prior written notice of its intention to\nchange its recommendation and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to change its recommendation\n(including, if the change of recommendation is in response to a superior acquisition proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of\nthe third party making the superior acquisition proposal, including any amendment or modification to the economic terms of, or any other material\namendment or modification to, such superior acquisition proposal) and (ii) at the end of the four business days\u2019 notice period, take into account any\namendment or modification to the Merger Agreement proposed by Tiger Parent and determine in good faith, after consulting with such outside advisors\nas it determines reasonably necessary, that changing its recommendation would nevertheless be required to comply with its fiduciary duties (if there is a\nsubsequent change to the economic terms of or any other material amendment to the superior acquisition proposal, it will be considered a new superior\nacquisition proposal, and the Board must provide Tiger Parent with a new two business days\u2019 notice period).\nEven if the Board changes its recommendation, unless the Merger Agreement is terminated, the special meeting of the stockholders of SYNNEX shall be\nconvened and the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Share Issuance Proposal, the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal and the Corporate\nOpportunity Charter Amendment Proposal shall be submitted to SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders.\nEfforts to Complete the Merger\nSYNNEX and Tiger Parent have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all necessary\nactions, and do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as\npromptly as practicable\u037e (ii) make, or cause to be made, the registrations, declarations and filings required for HSR Act Clearance, the required filings, and\nthe required consents, (iii) prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as\npracticable all permits, consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of all third parties and governmental entities which are necessary or advisable\nto consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,\napprovals, clearances and authorizations of governmental entities, and (iv) seek to avoid or prevent the initiation of any investigation, claim, action, suit,\narbitration, litigation or proceeding by or before any governmental entity challenging Merger Agreement or the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nIn furtherance of the parties\u2019 reasonable best efforts, each of SYNNEX, Tiger Parent, and their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, to the extent required\nin order to obtain HSR Act Clearance, the required filings, and the required consents, or any other approvals of a governmental entity required to\nconsummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has agreed to (i) propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to, any\nsale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or other encumbrance, or holding separate, of any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,\nbusinesses or interest therein\u037e and (ii) take or agree to\n \n89\nTable of Contents\ntake any other action, agree or consent to, make any concession in respect of, or permit or suffer to exist any condition or requirement setting forth, any\nlimitations or restrictions on freedom of actions with respect to, or its ability to retain, or make changes in, any assets, licenses, operations, rights,\nproduct lines, businesses or interest therein (which we collectively refer to as \u201cregulatory concessions\u201d). However, neither party nor its subsidiaries are\nrequired to, and neither party shall without the consent of the other party, agree or consent to a regulatory concession (including any divesture) that\nwould be or would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the combined company, taken as a whole, following the\nMerger.\nSYNNEX and Tiger Parent have agreed to use reasonable best efforts (until the Merger Agreement is terminated) to (i) oppose or defend against any\nproceeding by any governmental entity to prevent or enjoin the consummation of the Merger or (ii) overturn any regulatory order by any governmental\nentity preventing consummation of the Merger, including by defending against or seeking to vacate, overturn, terminate or appeal any order that would\nprevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.\nThe parties have also agreed to not, and to cause their respective subsidiaries to not, acquire or agree to acquire, by merger or consolidation, or by\npurchasing the assets or equity of, any business, corporation, partnership, association, or business organization or division, or take any other similar\naction, if taking such action would reasonably be expected to (i) materially delay obtaining, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, HSR Act\nClearance, the required filings, the required consents, or any other authorizations, consents, orders, clearances or approvals of a governmental entity\nnecessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) increase, in any material respect, the risk of any governmental\nentity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) increase the risk, in any material\nrespect, of not being able to remove an order, on appeal or otherwise, that prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement\u037e or (iv) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nFinancing\nFinancing Not a Condition to the Merger\nIn connection with its entry into the Merger Agreement, SYNNEX entered into a Bridge Commitment Letter, under which Citi and certain other financing\ninstitutions joining thereto pursuant to the terms thereof committed to provide $7.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured\ncommitments. On April 16, 2021, SYNNEX entered into a $5.0 billion takeout facility in the aggregate, pursuant to which the takeout lenders have\ncommitted to provide a senior unsecured revolving credit facility not to exceed an aggregate principal amount of $3.5 billion and a senior unsecured term\nloan in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. Upon entry into the takeout facility, the commitments under the Bridge Commitment\nLetter were reduced by $5.0 billion to $2.5 billion. The applicable lenders\u2019 obligations to fund their respective remaining commitments under the Bridge\nCommitment Letter and under the takeout facility are subject to several conditions as set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter and in the takeout facility,\nincluding, among others, completion of the Merger, the non-occurrence of a material adverse effect on Tech Data, the accuracy of certain representations\nand warranties related to both SYNNEX and Tech Data and SYNNEX\u2019 and Tech Data\u2019s delivery of certain financial statements.\nThe availability of the term loan commitments under the Bridge Commitment Letter and the loans under the takeout facility are not conditions to SYNNEX\u2019\nor either Merger Sub\u2019s respective obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nCooperation of SYNNEX\nUntil the closing or the termination of the Merger Agreement, SYNNEX has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all\nactions necessary, advisable and proper in connection with the\n \n90\nTable of Contents\narrangement, marketing and consummation of the issuance of any debt securities and/or the incurrence of any other Permanent Financing by SYNNEX\nthat is reasonably acceptable to SYNNEX and Tiger Parent in lieu of the Financing.\nFurthermore, in the event any funds required to satisfy the transaction uses become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the\nCommitment Letter or the financing agreements, SYNNEX has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain Alternative Financing in an amount\nsufficient to allow it to satisfy the transaction uses, and to obtain the Alternative Commitment Letter on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to\nSYNNEX and Tiger Parent.\nSYNNEX has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or\nadvisable to consummate and obtain the Financing in an amount sufficient (together with any other cash sources available to SYNNEX or its\nsubsidiaries) to (i) repay, prepay, refinance, redeem or otherwise satisfy any indebtedness of SYNNEX, Tiger Parent or their respective subsidiaries\ncontemplated or required to be satisfied in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) pay all fees\nand expenses of SYNNEX and its subsidiaries related to or arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\nthat are required to be paid at closing, and (iii) pay all other amounts required to be paid by SYNNEX and its subsidiaries pursuant to or in connection\nwith the Merger Agreement at closing (which we refer to collectively as the \u201ctransaction uses\u201d), on terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in\nthe Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements related to the Financing (which we refer to collectively, as the context may require for any applicable\nFinancing, as the \u201cfinancing agreements\u201d).\nIn furtherance of the foregoing, SYNNEX has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect, until closing, the Commitment Letter or the\nfinancing agreements, as applicable, (ii) materially comply with the obligations that are set forth in the Commitment Letter and the financing agreements\nthat are applicable to SYNNEX and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions precedent in the Commitment Letter and the financing agreements that are\nwithin its control, and (iii) to the extent necessary to satisfy the transaction uses, fully enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and the financing\nagreements. SYNNEX has agreed that it will not, prior to the closing, release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under the\nCommitment Letter or the financing agreements without the consent of Tiger Parent (other than in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter as\nin effect on the date of the Merger Agreement).\nSYNNEX has agreed to give Tiger Parent prompt written notice upon it obtaining knowledge of any of the following:\n \n \n\u2022\n any material breach (or threatened in writing material breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to\ngive rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the Commitment Letter or the financing agreements\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n any actual or threatened in writing

Commitment Letter or the financing agreements.\nExcept for certain enumerated exceptions, SYNNEX has agreed to not, without the prior written consent of Tiger Parent, amend, modify, supplement,\nrestate, substitute, replace, terminate, or agree to any waiver under the Commitment Letter or any financing agreement, which consent in the case of an\namendment, modification or restatement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed so long as such amendment, modification or\n \n91\nTable of Contents\nrestatement would not (i) reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede, or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by Merger Agreement, materially delay or impair the availability of the Financing or make the funding of the Financing at the\nclosing less likely to occur, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing such that SYNNEX would have insufficient funds to satisfy the transaction\nuses, (iii) contain additional or modified conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing relative to those set forth in the Commitment Letter as in\neffect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or (iv) reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of SYNNEX to enforce or cause the\nenforcement of its rights under the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements\nCooperation of Tiger Parent\nSubject to certain limitations and other caveats, Tiger Parent has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to (and cause its subsidiaries and their\nrespective directors, officers,

Tiger Parent\u2019s respective employee benefit plans with a view towards developing appropriate new employee benefit plans, or selecting which if the\nparties\u2019 respective existing employee benefit plans, that will apply with respect to employees of the combined company following the Merger (which we\nrefer to collectively as the \u201cnew benefit plans\u201d). The combined company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the new benefit plans, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, to (i) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors,\nincluding duties, geographic location, tenure, qualifications and abilities, and (ii) not discriminate between employees who were previously employed by\nSYNNEX and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and those employed by Tiger Parent and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, at the time of the Merger.\n \n92\nTable of Contents\nDuring the six month period immediately following the Merger, the combined company shall provide each employee of Tiger Parent and each employee of\nSYNNEX (and their respective subsidiaries) who continues to remain employed by the combined company (each of whom we refer to as a \u201cLegacy\nEmployee\u201d), with an annual base salary or wage rate and severance benefits (in the event that such Legacy Employee terminated during the six month\nperiod following the Merger), in each case, that are no less favorable than the greater of (i) such Legacy Employee\u2019s salary or wage rate, as applicable,\nand severance entitlement as of immediately prior to the Merger or (ii) the salary or wage rate, as applicable, and severance entitlement in effect for\nsimilarly situated employees of the combined company.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, with respect to any new benefit plans that any Legacy Employees first become eligible to participate on or\nafter the Merger, and that such Legacy Employee did not participate in prior to the Merger, the parties have agreed that the combined company will use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage\nrequirements applicable to the Legacy Employees and their eligible dependents (unless such preexisting conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would\napply under the analogous SYNNEX or Tiger Parent employee benefit plan), (ii) provide the Legacy Employees and their eligible dependents with credit\nfor any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Merger under a SYNNEX or Tiger Parent employee benefit plan in satisfying any applicable\ndeductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any new benefit plans, and (iii) recognize all service of the Legacy Employees with Tiger Parent or\nSYNNEX and their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all purposes in any new benefit plan. However, service recognition will not apply (a) to the\nextent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (b) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan,\n(c) for purposes of any benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (d) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits,\nor (e) to the extent it would require any retroactive contributions.\nDirector and Officer Indemnification and Insurance\nFor at least six years after the Effective Time, the parties have agreed to cause the combined company to indemnify and hold harmless, and advance\nexpenses to, such persons that are indemnified as of the date of the Merger Agreement by Tiger Parent pursuant to the organizational documents of Tiger\nParent or its subsidiaries or any existing and specified indemnification agreements, and such persons that are indemnified as of the date of the Merger\nAgreement by SYNNEX pursuant to the organizational documents of SYNNEX or its subsidiaries or any existing and specified indemnification\nagreements against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection\nwith any threatened in writing or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer\nor employee of SYNNEX, Tiger Parent, or their respective subsidiaries pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Merger, including the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nFurther, for at least six years after the Merger, the parties have agreed to cause the combined company to maintain in effect, insurance coverage\nequivalent to the coverage under the policies of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance maintained by Tiger Parent as of the date of the Merger\nAgreement with respect to claims arising at or prior to the Merger, subject to an annual cap of 300% of the annual premium of Tiger Parent\u2019s insurance\npolicy. If the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceed the annual cap, the combined company will obtain a policy with the greatest\ncoverage available for a cost equal to the annual cap. In the alternative, the combined company may, or at SYNNEX request, obtain a six year \u201ctail\u201d policy\nunder Tiger Parent\u2019s existing directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described above\u037e provided that the premium\npayable for such \u201ctail\u201d policy does not exceed the annual cap.\nEquity Contribution\nTiger Parent has agreed to cause one or more of its applicable affiliates to make an equity contribution to Tiger Parent prior to the Effective Time of at least\n$500,000,000 in cash, in exchange for shares of Tiger Parent\u2019s\n \n93\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock (which shall in no way increase the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement).\nOther Covenants\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, SYNNEX and Tiger Parent made certain other covenants to and agreements with each other regarding various\nother matters including, but not limited to:\n \n \n\u2022\n confidentiality and access to certain of each other\u2019s information during the period prior to Merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n actions to be taken (and not taken) by SYNNEX and Tiger Parent to ensure that the Merger qualifies as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the delivery of a tax opinion and certain tax certificates by the parties, if requested.\n \n \n\u2022\n participation by Tiger Parent with SYNNEX in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against SYNNEX relating to\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the required consent of SYNNEX prior to certain settlements of any such\nlitigation\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n actions to be taken (and not taken) by SYNNEX and Tiger with respect to anti-takeover laws to ensure that the Merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement and to otherwise take such actions necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of such anti-takeover laws on the\nMerger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n actions to be taken by SYNNEX and Tiger Parent in connection with and with respect to Sections 16(a) and 16(b) of the Exchange Act\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n resubmission of the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal to SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders at the next annual meeting, if such\nproposal is not approved at the special meeting\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n obtaining the resignations of the directors, managers and officers of Tiger Parent and its subsidiaries\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n providing certain financial statements of Tech Data by Tiger Parent to SYNNEX during the period prior to Merger.\nRepresentations and Warranties",

            "text": "SYNNEX UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe SYNNEX Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements, which are referred to in this proxy statement as the Unaudited Pro Forma\nFinancial Statements, presented below are derived from the continuing operations of the historical consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX and the\nparent company of Tech Data Corporation, Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation (which we refer to as \u201cTiger Parent\u201d). The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial\nStatements are prepared as a business combination and SYNNEX has been treated as the acquirer in the merger for accounting purposes. The unaudited\npro forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared as if SYNNEX\u2019 acquisition of Tiger Parent had been completed on\nDecember 1, 2019, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared as if SYNNEX\u2019 acquisition of Tiger Parent had\nbeen completed on February 28, 2021.\nThe Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are developed from and should be read in conjunction with the following historical consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying notes of SYNNEX filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cSEC\u201d): (a) the unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements of SYNNEX contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended February 28, 2021\u037e (b) the\naudited consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2020\u037e and (c) the\naudited consolidated financial statements of Tiger Parent as of January 31, 2021 and for each of the periods in the three-year period then ended, which are\nincluded herein below.\nThe SYNNEX column in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 was derived from\ncontinuing operations of the consolidated financial statements included in Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021. The Tiger Parent column in\nthe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021 was derived by combining the\nhistorical predecessor consolidated statement of operations for the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 with the successor consolidated\nfinancial statements for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 included herein below. The Tiger Parent column in the unaudited pro forma\ncondensed combined statements of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2021 was derived from the unaudited historical successor\nconsolidated financial statements for the three months ended January 31, 2021.\nSYNNEX and Tiger Parent have different fiscal years. SYNNEX\u2019 fiscal year ends on November 30, whereas Tiger Parent\u2019s fiscal year ends on January 31.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of operations have been prepared utilizing period ends that differ by less\nthan 93 days, as permitted by Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of February 28, 2021\ncombines SYNNEX\u2019 balance sheet as of February 28, 2021 with the Tiger Parent balance sheet as of January 31, 2021. The unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 combines continuing operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 for\nSYNNEX and the pro forma predecessor and successor operations for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021 for Tiger Parent. The unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined statement of operations for the three months ended February 28, 2021 combines continuing operations for the three months\nended February 28, 2021 for SYNNEX and the successor results of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2021 for Tiger Parent.\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, SYNNEX has not completed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at final estimates of the fair market\nvalue of Tiger Parent\u2019s assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed and the related allocations of purchase price, nor has it identified all\nadjustments necessary to conform Tiger Parent to SYNNEX\u2019 accounting policies. As indicated in Note 4 to the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial\nStatements, based on information currently available, SYNNEX has made certain adjustments to the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of\nTiger Parent to reflect preliminary estimates of fair values necessary to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, with the excess of the\npurchase price over the adjusted historical net assets of Tiger Parent recorded as goodwill. Actual results may differ from these Unaudited Pro Forma\nFinancial Statements once the Merger is completed and SYNNEX has determined the final purchase price\n \n103Table of Contents\nfor Tiger Parent, has completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations and has identified any additional\nconforming accounting policy changes for Tiger Parent. There can be no assurance that such finalization will not result in material changes.\nThe Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements have been prepared to include factually supportable adjustments which give effect to events that are\ndirectly attributable to the merger regardless of whether they are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results or are non-recurring.\nThe pro forma financial information has been prepared by SYNNEX for illustrative and informational purposes only, in accordance with Regulation S-X\nArticle 11, Pro Forma Financial Information, as amended by the final rule, \u201cAmendments to Financial Disclosures About Acquired and Disposed\nBusinesses,\u201d as adopted by the SEC on May 21, 2020 (which we refer to as \u201cArticle 11\u201d). The pro forma financial information, based on various\nadjustments and assumptions, is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what SYNNEX\u2019 consolidated statements of\noperations or consolidated statement of financial condition actually would have been had the Merger, the borrowings drawdown and the stock issuance\nbeen completed as of the dates presented or will be for any future periods. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements do not purport to project the\nfuture financial position or operating results of SYNNEX following the completion of the Merger and do not include the realization of cost savings from\noperating efficiencies, revenue synergies or other integration costs expected to result from the Tiger Parent acquisition. The pro forma financial\ninformation does not include adjustments to reflect any potential synergies or dis-synergies cost in connection with the Merger.\n \n104\nTable of Contents\nSYNNEX

otherwise stated, currency and share amounts in thousands)\n(amounts may not add or compute due to rounding)\nNote 1. Description of the Transaction\nOn March 22, 2021, SYNNEX, Spire Sub I, Inc., Spire Sub II, LLC, and Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation, which is the parent corporation of Tech Data\nCorporation (which we refer to as \u201cTiger Parent\u201d), entered into an agreement and plan of merger, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of\nthe Merger Agreement, Spire Sub I will merge with and into the Tiger Parent, with the resulting company surviving the initial merger as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of SYNNEX, followed immediately by the merger of this combined corporation with and into Spire Sub II, LLC. Upon the closing of the\ntransaction, this surviving company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX (which we refer to as the \u201cMerger\u201d).\nOn June 30, 2020, affiliates of certain funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management Inc. (which we refer to as \u201cApollo\u201d) acquired Tiger\nParent. Upon completion of the Merger, Apollo, the sole stockholder that owns Tiger Parent, will receive (1) $1,610,000 in cash plus (2) 44,000 shares of\ncommon stock of SYNNEX.\nThe aggregate purchase consideration in the Merger is based on an estimated SYNNEX closing price and cash consideration aggregating $7,107,800 (see\nNote 3).\nTo finance the Merger and repay certain indebtedness, SYNNEX has obtained long-term term financing commitments of $7,500,000 in the aggregate (see\nNote 5A).\nNote 2. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation\nThe Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent. The\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are prepared as a business combination using the acquisition method, and SYNNEX has been treated as the\nacquirer for accounting purposes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared as if SYNNEX\u2019\nacquisition of Tiger Parent had been completed on December 1, 2019, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared\nas if SYNNEX\u2019 acquisition of Tiger Parent had been completed on February 28, 2021.\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, SYNNEX has not performed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at the final estimates of the fair\nvalue of the Tiger Parent assets to be acquired, the liabilities to be assumed and the related allocations of purchase price. As indicated in Note 5 to the\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, SYNNEX has made certain adjustments to the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of Tiger\nParent to reflect preliminary estimates of fair value necessary to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, with the excess of the purchase\nprice over the adjusted historical net assets of Tiger Parent, recorded as goodwill. Actual results may differ from these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial\nStatements once the Merger is completed and SYNNEX has determined the final purchase price for Tiger Parent and has completed the valuation studies\nnecessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations and identified any additional conforming accounting policy changes for Tiger Parent. There\ncan be no assurance that such finalization will not result in material changes.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared to reflect adjustments to SYNNEX\u2019 historical consolidated\nfinancial information that are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition of Tiger Parent, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) with respect to the unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the operating results of the combined company.\n \n108\nTable of Contents\nThe accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not give effect to any cost savings\nfrom operating efficiencies, revenue synergies or costs for the integration of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent\u2019s operations. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial\nStatements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations of SYNNEX\nwould have been had the Tiger Parent Merger occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of\noperations or consolidated financial position. Although SYNNEX projects that significant cost savings will result from the Merger, there can be no\nassurance that these cost savings will be achieved. Any restructuring or integration costs will be expensed in the appropriate accounting periods after\ncompletion of the Merger.\nAccounting periods presented\nSYNNEX and Tiger Parent have different fiscal years. SYNNEX\u2019 fiscal year ends on November 30, whereas Tiger Parent\u2019s fiscal year ends on\nJanuary 31. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of operations have been prepared utilizing period ends that\ndiffer by less than 93 days, as permitted by Rule 11-02 Regulation S-X. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of February 28,\n2021 is presented as if the acquisition and issuance of SYNNEX common stock to the Tiger Parent stockholder had occurred on February 28, 2021 and\ncombines SYNNEX\u2019 balance sheet as of February 28, 2021 with the Tiger Parent balance sheet as of January 31, 2021. The unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 combines the historical results from continuing operations of SYNNEX for the\nyear ended November 30, 2020 and the combined historical results of Tiger Parent predecessor and successor entities for the twelve months ended\nJanuary 31, 2021. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the three months ended February 28, 2021 combines\ncontinuing operations for the three months ended February 28, 2021 for SYNNEX and the successor results of operations for the three months ended\nJanuary 31, 2021 for Tiger Parent.\nConforming accounting policies\nCertain reclassifications have been made to Tiger Parent\u2019s historical financial statements to conform to the presentation used in SYNNEX\u2019 historical\nfinancial information. Such reclassifications had no effect on Tiger Parent\u2019s previously reported financial position or results of operations. The pro forma\nfinancial data may not reflect all reclassifications necessary to conform Tiger Parent\u2019s presentation to that of SYNNEX due to limitations on the\navailability of information as of the date of this proxy statement. At completion of the Merger, SYNNEX will review Tiger Parent\u2019s accounting policies. As\na result of that review, SYNNEX may identify differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when conformed, could have a\nmaterial impact on the combined financial statements. At this time, SYNNEX is not aware of any differences that would have a material impact on the\ncombined financial statements, and therefore, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements assume there are no differences in\naccounting policies.\nNote 3. Estimated Purchase Price\nThe estimated purchase price allocation included with these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements is based upon an estimated purchase price using\nthe closing price of SYNNEX common stock on April 29, 2021. If the price of a share of SYNNEX common stock on the date the Merger is completed has\nincreased or decreased by 30% from the price assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the consideration\ntransferred would increase or decrease by approximately $1,649,340, which would be reflected in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial\nstatements as an increase or decrease to goodwill. The\n \n109\nTable of Contents\nestimated purchase consideration, together with a sensitivity analysis for the range of potential outcomes based upon variations in the recent stock price,\nis calculated as follows:\n \n \n  \n \n  \nEstimated consideration\n \n \n  \n \n  \nAssuming issuance\nof SYNNEX shares\non April 29, 2021    \nAssuming decrease\nin SYNNEX stock\nprice by historical\nvolatility percentage   \nAssuming increase\nin SYNNEX stock\nprice by historical\nvolatility percentage \nSYNNEX price per share on April 29, 2021\n  \n[a]\n  \n$\n124.95   \n$\n124.95   \n$\n124.95 \nAssumed share price based on historical 30%\nvolatility\n  \n[b]\n  \n$\n124.95   \n$\n87.47   \n$\n162.44 \nSYNNEX shares issued\n  \n[c]\n  \n \n44,000   \n \n44,000   \n \n44,000 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAggregate value of SYNNEX shares issued\n  \n[d=b*c]\n  \n$\n5,497,800   \n$\n3,848,460   \n$\n7,147,140 \nCash payable to Tiger Parent stockholder\n  \n[e]\n  \n$\n1,610,000   \n$\n1,610,000   \n$\n1,610,000 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAggregate purchase consideration\n  \n[f=d+e]\n  \n$\n7,107,800   \n$\n5,458,460   \n$\n8,757,140 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStock consideration attributed to par at $.001 par\nvalue\n  \n[g=c*$0.001]   \n$\n44   \n$\n44   \n$\n44 \nBalance stock consideration to additional paid in\ncapital\n  \n[h=d-g]\n  \n$\n5,497,756   \n$\n3,848,416   \n$\n7,147,096 \nIt is assumed that all shares of SYNNEX common stock issued will be new issuances. However, SYNNEX may issue treasury shares for a portion of the\nrequired shares of SYNNEX common stock.\nCertain Tiger Holdings outstanding long-term cash incentive and awards of stock-based partnership units estimated to aggregate $69,000 will be settled\nupon closing. At April 29, 2021, SYNNEX is unable to reasonably estimate the respective amounts attributable to pre- and post-Merger\nservices. Additionally, Tiger Holdings\u2019 unvested stock-based partnership units awarded to Tiger Parent employees, with an estimated fair value\nof approximately $117,000 with a remaining vesting period of up to two years will be converted into or redeemed for shares of SYNNEX stock with\nequivalent vesting terms. The fair value attributable to post-Merger services will be recorded as compensation expense in SYNNEX\u2019 post-Merger\nfinancial statements. At this time, SYNNEX is unable to reasonably estimate the respective amounts attributable to pre- and post-Merger services. The\nestimated 1,410 shares to be issued to the holders of such partnership units are included in the 44,000 shares above.\nNote 4. Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the Merger. The pro forma purchase price allocation below is based on preliminary\nestimates of fair value as of April 29, 2021, using the historical balance sheet of Tiger Parent as of January 31, 2021. As of the date of this proxy, SYNNEX\nhas not completed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at the required estimates of the fair value of Tiger Parent\u2019s assets to be acquired and\nthe liabilities to be assumed and the related allocations of purchase price. Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to acquired intangible assets is\nbased on preliminary fair value estimates and is subject to final management analysis, with the assistance of third-party valuation advisors, following the\ncompletion of the Merger. The estimated intangible asset values and their useful lives could be affected by a variety of factors that may become known to\nSYNNEX only upon access to additional information and/or changes in these factors that may occur prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. The\npreliminary estimated intangible assets consist of customer relationships with an estimated weighted average useful life of fourteen years and indefinite\nlived trade names. The estimated fair values of the intangibles were based on the purchase price allocation in the June 30, 2020 acquisition of Tiger Parent\nby Apollo. Additional intangible asset classes may be identified as the valuation process continues.\n \n110\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth a preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price to Tiger Parent\u2019s identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed by SYNNEX, with the excess recorded as goodwill:\n \n \n  \nEstimated fair value \nPurchase consideration (see Note 3 above)\n  \n$\n7,107,800 \n \n \n \n \n \nEstimated purchase price allocation\n  \nHistorical book value of Tiger Parent equity\n  \n$\n3,037,273 \nCash contribution to Tiger Parent equity prior to the Merger\n  \n \n500,000 \nLess:\n  \nElimination of historical Tiger Parent goodwill\n  \n \n(1,543,355) \nEstimated fair value adjustment of Tiger Parent debt to be assumed\n  \n \n(88,136) \nElimination of Tiger Parent deferred financing costs related to revolving lines of credit\n  \n \n(58,000) \nElimination of deferred taxes on Tiger Parent debt and lines of credit\n  \n \n(7,854) \nElimination of deferred taxes on historical Tiger Parent goodwill and other intangible assets\n  \n \n500,969 \nAdd:\n  \nDeferred tax impact of identifiable intangible assets\n  \n \n(732,249) \n \n \n \n \n \nPreliminary estimate of fair value of identifiable net assets acquired\n  \n \n1,608,648 \n \n \n \n \n \nGoodwill\n  \n$\n5,499,152 \n \n \n \n \n \nNote 5. Pro Forma Adjustments\n(A) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted as indicated below to record the issuance of SYNNEX term loans, net\nof debt issuance costs, an increase in Tiger Parent equity prior to the completion of Merger and cash payments to the Tiger Parent stockholder. To\nfinance the Merger, repay certain indebtedness and for on-going operational requirements, SYNNEX has obtained financing commitments aggregating\n$7,500,000. The commitments include a five-year credit facility comprising a term loan of $1,500,000 and an unsecured revolving line of credit facility of\n$3,500,000. The remaining $2,500,000 of bridge financing commitments, which are syndicated to a number of financial institutions are expected to be\nissued as unsecured notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet assumes that unsecured notes of $2,500,000 would be entered\ninto at, or near, the closing of the transaction with varying maturities, with an assumed weighted average interest rate of 2.69%, including estimated debt\nissuance cost. Debt issuance cost related to the refinanced term loans of $1,500,000 and new revolving lines of credit facilities of $3,500,000 are estimated\nto result in additional interest expense of approximately 14 basis points. As SYNNEX has used interest rate derivative contracts to economically convert\nthese variable-rate term loans to fixed-rate debt, there is no material impact on the combined interest cost. The write-off of deferred financing costs of\n$3,030 related to these term loans has been recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nbalance sheet and has been recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt in other income (expense), net in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nstatement of operations for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2020.\n \n111\nTable of Contents\nCash contribution to Tiger Parent equity prior to the Merger\n  \n \n500,000 \nCash proceeds from notes planned to be issued\n  \n \n2,500,000 \nDebt discount and issuance costs\n  \n \n(31,675) \nFinancing expenses for bridge loan facility\n  \n \n(40,625) \nLess: Cash paid to:\n  \nTiger Parent\u2019s stockholder\n  \n \n(1,610,000) \nTiger Parent\u2019s debt holders\n  \n \n(2,411,530) \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(1,093,830) \n \n \n \n \n \n(B) To eliminate Tiger Parent\u2019s historical goodwill and record the preliminary estimate of goodwill as a result of the Merger:\n \n \n  \nTiger Parent historical amount   \nEstimated goodwill   \nNet adjustment \nGoodwill (see Note 4 above)\n  \n$\n1,543,355   \n$\n5,499,152   \n$\n3,955,797 \n(C) Upon completion of the Merger, identifiable intangible assets are required to be measured at fair value, and these acquired assets could include assets\nthat are not intended to be used or sold or that are intended to be used in a manner other than their highest and best use. The fair value of identifiable\nintangible assets is determined primarily using variations of the \u201cincome approach,\u201d which is based on the present value of the future after-tax cash flows\nattributable to each identifiable intangible asset. Other valuation methods, including the market approach and cost approach, are also considered in\nestimating the fair value.\nThese preliminary estimates of fair value and weighted-average useful life may be different from the amounts included in the final acquisition accounting,\nand the difference could have a material impact on the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements. Once SYNNEX has full access to\ninformation about Tiger Parent\u2019s intangible assets, additional insight will be gained that could impact (i) the estimated total value assigned to identifiable\nintangible assets and/or (ii) the estimated weighted-average useful life of each category of intangible assets. The estimated intangible asset values and\ntheir useful lives could be impacted by a variety of factors that may become known to SYNNEX only upon access to additional information and/or by\nchanges in such factors that may occur prior to completion of the Merger. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory,\nlegislative, legal, technological and/or competitive environments. Increased knowledge about these and/or other elements could result in a change to the\nestimated fair value of the identifiable Tiger Parent intangible assets and/or to the estimated weighted-average useful lives from what SYNNEX has\nassumed in these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements. The combined effect of any such changes could then also result in a significant increase or\ndecrease to SYNNEX\u2019 estimate of associated amortization expense.\nIncluded in Tiger Parent\u2019s pro forma predecessor and successor combined statement of operations for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021 used in\nthe combined unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 is amortization of intangible assets from the date of its\nacquisition by Apollo. This adjustment is recorded to increase the amortization of intangible assets to reflect the full year impact of the Merger.\n(D) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reclassify Tiger Parent\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded\nin \u201cother assets, net\u201d and \u201cother long-term liabilities\u201d respectively in conformity with SYNNEX classification of \u201cdeferred tax assets\u201d and \u201cdeferred tax\nliabilities.\u201d In addition, unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reclassify Tiger Parent\u2019s receivables from vendors\nrecorded as an offset within \u201caccounts payable\u201d in conformity with SYNNEX classification of \u201creceivables from vendors.\u201d\n \n112\nTable of Contents\n(E) Total estimated non-recurring acquisition-related transaction costs to be incurred by SYNNEX and Tiger Parent are approximately $42,000 to complete\nthe Merger. These costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with regulatory filings and Merger activities. The unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 has been adjusted to record estimated non-recurring costs of $42,000 in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses. To the extent, the estimated Tiger Parent costs are incurred prior to the closing of the Merger, these costs will not\nform part of the combined retained earnings as Tiger Parent\u2019s historical shareholders\u2019 equity accounts will be eliminated upon acquisition (see Note 5G).\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of February 28, 2021 has been adjusted to record estimated acquisition-related costs of\n$42,000 in other accrued liabilities. A corresponding tax benefit of $5,250 has been recorded in income taxes payable, with the net of tax impact presented\nas a decrease to retained earnings.\n(F) As of the completion of the Merger, SYNNEX will establish net deferred tax liabilities and make other tax adjustments as part of the accounting for the\nMerger, primarily related to estimated fair value adjustments for identifiable intangible assets. Deferred taxes are recognized for the temporary difference\nbetween assigned values in the purchase price allocation and the carryover tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The pro forma\nadjustments to record the effect of deferred taxes was computed as follows:\n \nEstimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets to be acquired\n  \n$ 2,928,996 \n \n \n \n \n \nDeferred tax liabilities associated with the estimated fair value of identified intangible assets to be acquired,\nat 25%(1)\n  \n \n(732,249) \nPro forma adjustments to deferred taxes:\n  \nElimination of deferred taxes on historical Tiger Parent intangibles\n  \n \n500,969 \nElimination of deferred taxes on certain other historical Tiger Parent items\n  \n \n(7,854) \n \n \n \n \n \nDeferred taxes associated with the estimated fair value adjustments of assets to be acquired and liabilities\nto be assumed\n  \n$\n(239,134) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1)\nSYNNEX assumed a 25% tax rate when estimating the deferred tax impacts of the acquisition, which is based on the applicable statutory rate as of\nthe assumed acquisition date and appropriately reflects certain SYNNEX and Tiger Parent bases differences that will not result in taxable or\ndeductible amounts in future years when the related financial reporting asset or liability will be recovered or settled.\n(G) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to eliminate Tiger Parent\u2019s historical shareholders\u2019 equity accounts.\n(H) Reflects elimination of management fee paid by Tiger Parent subsequent to its acquisition by Apollo. Such fees are not payable upon completion of\nthe Merger.\n(I) The unaudited pro forma statements of operations have been adjusted to record estimated additional interest expense related to the estimated\n$2,500,000 of borrowings that will be used by SYNNEX to fund the Merger (see Note 5(A)). The weighted average interest rate on the notes expected to\nbe issued is assumed to be 2.69%, including debt issuance cost. In addition, debt issuance cost related to the refinanced term loans of $1,500,000 and new\nrevolving lines of credit facilities of $3,500,000 are estimated to result in additional interest expense of approximately 14 basis points.\nSYNNEX estimates additional interest expense of $40,625 in the year ended November 30, 2020, related to the amortization of debt issuance costs\nassociated with the bridge financing expected to be issued to partially fund the Merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as\nof February 28, 2021 has been\n \n113\nTable of Contents\nadjusted to reflect the net of tax ($10,156) impact as a decrease to retained earnings. SYNNEX also estimates a reduction in interest expense to eliminate\nTiger Parent\u2019s historical interest costs.\n \n \n  \nYear ended\nNovember 30, 2020   \nThree months ended\nFebruary 28, 2021  \nAdditional interest expense associated with notes to finance\nthe Merger\n  \n$\n67,360   \n$\n16,840 \nAdditional interest expense associated with the refinanced\nterm loans and new lines of credit facilities\n  \n \n8,971   \n \n2,236 \nFinancing expenses for bridge loan facility\n  \n \n40,625   \n \n\u2014   \nElimination of historical interest expense associated with Tiger\nParent\u2019s debt assumed to be settled as part of the Merger\n  \n \n(121,424)   \n \n(39,953) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal estimated decrease in interest expense\n  \n$\n(4,469)   \n$\n(20,877) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA 1/8% variance in variable interest rate related to the term loan to finance the Merger would impact income from continuing operations by an increase or\ndecrease of $8,262 for the year ended November 30, 2020 and $2,000 for the three months ended February 28, 2021, respectively.\n(J) The unaudited pro forma statements of operations have been adjusted to reflect the aggregate pro forma income tax effect of the pro forma\nadjustments above. SYNNEX assumed a blended tax rate of 25% for both the year ended November 30, 2020 and three months ended February 28, 2021,\nwhen estimating the tax impact of the Merger, representing the federal statutory tax rate applicable to each period and exclusion of any state tax impacts\nthat are unknown as of the date of this proxy statement. Such unknown amounts are expected to be immaterial.

            "text": "DESCRIPTION OF TECH DATA BUSINESS\nOverview\nTech Data Corporation is one of the world\u2019s largest IT distribution and solutions companies. Tech Data serves a critical role in the center of the IT\necosystem, bringing products from the world\u2019s leading technology vendors to market, as well as helping customers create solutions best suited to\nmaximize business outcomes for their end-user customers. Tech Data\u2019s customers include value-added resellers (which we refer to as \u201cVARs\u201d), direct\nmarketers, retailers, corporate resellers and managed service providers (which we refer to as \u201cMSPs\u201d) who support the diverse technology needs of end\nusers.\nTech Data was incorporated in 1974 to market data processing supplies to end users of mini and mainframe computers. With the advent of microcomputer\ndealers, Tech Data made the transition to a wholesale technology distributor in 1983 by broadening its product line to include personal computer\nproducts and withdrawing entirely from end-user sales.\nVendors and Customers\nTech Data\u2019s value proposition to its vendors:\n \n \n\u2022\n Access to highly fragmented markets. Tech Data provides its vendors access to large and highly fragmented markets such as the small- and\nmedium-sized business (which we refer to as \u201cSMB\u201d) sector, which relies on VARs, its primary customer base, to gain access to and support\nfor new technology.\n \n \n\u2022\n Variable-cost route to market. Tech Data serves as a variable, cost effective route to market for its vendors by providing them with access to\nresellers throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\n \n \n\u2022\n Logistics management. Tech Data\u2019s world class logistics capabilities enable it to efficiently bring technology products to market through\none of its 24 strategically located logistics centers, by direct shipment from vendors to customers, or virtually through the Tech Data cloud\nmarketplace.\n \n \n\u2022\n Services. Tech Data provides a comprehensive portfolio of services to its vendors, including integration services, supply chain management\nservices, and field, depot and support services, such as field engineering, equipment installation, maintenance, repair and many others.\nTech Data distributes and markets hundreds of thousands of products from approximately 1,000 of the world\u2019s leading technology hardware\nmanufacturers and software publishers, as well as suppliers of next-generation technologies and delivery models such as converged and hyper-\nconverged infrastructure, the cloud, security, analytics/Internet of things (which we refer to as \u201cIoT\u201d), and services. These products are typically\npurchased directly from the vendor on a non-exclusive basis. Conversely, Tech Data\u2019s vendor agreements do not restrict Tech Data from selling similar\nproducts manufactured by competitors, nor do they require Tech Data to sell a specified quantity of product. As a result, Tech Data has the flexibility to\nterminate or curtail sales of one product line in favor of another due to technological change, pricing considerations, product availability, and customer\ndemand or vendor distribution policies. Overall, Tech Data believes that its diversified and evolving product and solutions portfolio provides a solid\nplatform for continued growth.\nTech Data\u2019s value proposition to its customers:\n \n \n\u2022\n End-to-end solutions. Tech Data helps its customers create comprehensive, multi-vendor solutions from the world\u2019s leading technology\nvendors to maximize business outcomes for their end-user customers.\n \n \n\u2022\n Logistics management. Tech Data\u2019s robust order and logistics management systems enable it to fulfill customer orders quickly and\nefficiently through one of its 24 strategically located logistics centers, by direct shipment from the vendor, or virtually through the Tech\nData cloud marketplace.\n \n117Table of Contents\n \n\u2022\n Financing and inventory management. Tech Data provides its customers with access to flexible financing programs and inventory\nmanagement for the technology products, services and solutions they acquire.\n \n \n\u2022\n Training and technical support. Tech Data provides its reseller customers a high level of training and technical support.\n \n \n\u2022\n Services. Tech Data provides its customers with complete customer management solutions, including customer acquisition, enablement and\nrevenue-growth services, such as contract renewals and software license compliance, as well as product configuration/integration services.\nIn addition, Tech Data provides its resellers access to a number of special promotions and marketing services on behalf of its vendors.\nTech Data serves one of the largest bases of resellers throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Tech Data\u2019s products are purchased directly\nfrom vendors in significant quantities and are marketed to an active reseller base of over 125,000 VARs, direct marketers, retailers, corporate resellers and\nMSPs. Tech Data\u2019s VAR customers, in many cases, rely on Tech Data as their principal source of technology products and the related financing for the\nproducts. VARs typically prefer not to invest the resources to establish a large number of direct purchasing relationships with vendors or stock\nsignificant product inventories. Direct marketers, retailers and corporate resellers may establish direct relationships with vendors for their highest volume\nproducts, but utilize distributors as the primary source for other product requirements and an alternative source for products acquired directly. Tech\nData\u2019s customers rely on its expertise and resources to gain vital insights into emerging technologies and to help them capture growth opportunities in a\nrapidly changing technology landscape. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of Tech Data\u2019s net sales during the period from July 1, 2020 to\nJanuary 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019.\nProducts and Services\nTech Data groups its offerings into two primary solutions portfolios:\n \n \n\u2022\n Endpoint Solutions Portfolio: This primarily includes PC systems, mobile phones and accessories, printers, peripherals, supplies, endpoint\ntechnology software and consumer electronics.\n \n \n\u2022\n Advanced Solutions Portfolio: This primarily includes data center technologies such as storage, networking, servers, advanced technology\nsoftware and converged and hyper-converged infrastructure. The Advanced Solutions portfolio also includes Tech Data\u2019s specialized\nsolution businesses.\nEmployees\nOn January 31, 2021, Tech Data had over 14,000 employees (as measured on a full-time equivalent basis) in more than forty countries on five continents.\n \n118\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF TIGER PARENT",

(\u201cMerger Sub\u201d). Tiger Midco and Merger Sub are affiliates of\ncertain funds (the \u201cApollo Funds\u201d), managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management Inc. (\u201cApollo\u201d). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Tiger Midco\nagreed to acquire all the outstanding shares of Tech Data Corporation\u2019s common stock (other than shares held by Tech Data Corporation as treasury\nstock or held by certain affiliates of the Apollo Funds) for $145 per share in cash. On June 30, 2020, Merger Sub merged with and into Tech Data\nCorporation (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with Tech Data Corporation surviving the Merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Tiger Midco (see Note 4 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries including Tiger\nMidco, is the parent company of Tech Data Corporation subsequent to the Merger. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $5.2 billion. Tiger\nParent Holdings, L.P. (the \u201cParent\u201d), the parent company of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation, contributed approximately $3.7 billion as equity to Tiger Parent\n(AP) Corporation in conjunction with the Merger, of which approximately $3.6 billion was used to fund the purchase price for Tech Data Corporation. The\nremaining purchase price for Tech Data Corporation was financed through the issuance of debt (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for further discussion) and cash on hand at Tech Data Corporation.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 include the consolidated results of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation from\nthe date of the Merger through January 31, 2021 (the \u201csuccessor period\u201d) and the consolidated results of Tech Data Corporation for periods prior to the\nMerger on June 30, 2020 (the \u201cpredecessor period\u201d). References to \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d indicate Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries for periods subsequent to the date of the Merger and Tech Data Corporation and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the Merger.\nWe are one of the world\u2019s largest IT distribution and solutions companies. We serve a critical role in the center of the IT ecosystem, bringing products\nfrom the world\u2019s leading technology vendors to market, as well as helping our customers create solutions best suited to maximize business outcomes for\ntheir end-user customers. We\n \n119Table of Contents\ndistribute and market products from many of the world\u2019s leading technology hardware manufacturers and software publishers, as well as suppliers of\nnext-generation technologies and delivery models such as converged and hyperconverged infrastructure, the cloud, security, analytics/Internet of things\n(\u201cIoT\u201d) and services. Our customers include value-added resellers, direct marketers, retailers, corporate resellers and managed service providers who\nsupport the diverse technology needs of end users.\nOn November 25, 2019, we completed the acquisition of DLT Solutions (\u201cDLT\u201d), a premier software and cloud solutions aggregator focused on the U.S.\npublic sector. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of DLT for a purchase price of approximately $209 million in cash. The DLT acquisition enables us\nto proactively develop opportunities, accelerate growth and simplify complexity for our channel partners that are serving the U.S. public sector space.\nFurthermore, on September 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Innovix Distribution (\u201cInnovix\u201d), a leading technology distributor in the Asia-Pacific\nregion, for a preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $52 million in cash. The Innovix acquisition expands our presence across the Asia-\nPacific region and strengthens our Endpoint Solutions and Advanced Solutions capabilities.\nPlanned SYNNEX Merger\nOn March 22, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cSYNNEX Merger Agreement\u201d) with SYNNEX Corporation (\u201cSYNNEX\u201d) and\nits affiliates. Pursuant to the SYNNEX Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions described therein, the affiliates of SYNNEX\nwill acquire all the outstanding shares of our common stock (the \u201cSYNNEX Merger\u201d).\nAt the effective time of the SYNNEX Merger, except as otherwise set forth in the SYNNEX Merger Agreement, all our issued and outstanding common\nshares will be converted automatically into and thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) $1,610,000,000 in cash, in the aggregate and (ii) 44,000,000\ntotal shares of common stock of SYNNEX. Prior to the effective date of the SYNNEX Merger, affiliates of Apollo are required to make an additional equity\ncontribution of at least $500 million in cash to the Company. The completion of the SYNNEX Merger is also subject to customary closing conditions,\nincluding the adoption of the SYNNEX Merger Agreement by a majority of the holders of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock, the\nexpiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, certain foreign regulatory\napprovals and other customary closing conditions.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) a pandemic. The global impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the global economy, disrupting the financial markets and creating increasing volatility, impacting\ncustomer demand and impeding global supply chains. In response to COVID-19, the company continues to operate with a significant portion of our\nglobal workforce participating in work-from-home arrangements and all of our logistics centers are open and functioning with strict health and safety\nguidelines in place. We cannot at this time accurately predict what effects these conditions will have on our operations and financial condition, including\ndue to uncertainties relating to the severity and duration of the pandemic, the effect on our customers and customer demand and the length of the\nrestrictions and closures imposed by various governments. Accordingly, the operating results and financial condition discussed herein may not be\nindicative of future operating results and trends.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures",

Professional services costs are primarily comprised of investment banking fees, legal expenses, and tax and other consulting\nservices. Stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to charges associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units and\nperformance based restricted stock units pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Personnel and other costs are primarily comprised of severance\ncosts including amounts due to employees pursuant to the Company\u2019s Change in Control Severance Policy, as well as retention costs.\nAdditionally, we recorded approximately $37 million of professional services costs during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 related to\nservices associated with start-up activities, specifically organization costs, as well as transaction costs related to the Merger, directed by Tiger Midco on\nbehalf of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation.

The GBO 2 Program includes investments that will optimize\nand standardize processes and apply data and analytics to be more agile in a rapidly evolving environment, increasing productivity, profitability and\noptimizing net-working capital. Acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses related to the GBO 2 Program are primarily comprised of restructuring\ncosts and other professional services costs. Restructuring costs are comprised of severance costs and other associated exit costs, including certain\nconsulting costs. Other professional services costs are primarily comprised of professional services fees not related to restructuring activities, including\ncosts related to improving profitability and optimizing net-working capital.

There were no tdONE costs incurred in the predecessor period.\nAcquisition of TS\nOn February 27, 2017, we acquired all the outstanding shares of TS for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion, comprised of\napproximately $2.5 billion in cash and 2,785,402 shares of our common stock.\nAcquisition, integration and restructuring expenses related to the acquisition of TS are primarily comprised of restructuring costs, IT related costs,\nprofessional services, transaction related costs and other costs. Restructuring costs are comprised of severance and facility exit costs. IT related costs\nconsist primarily of data center and non-ERP application migration and integration costs, as well as, IT related professional services. Professional\nservices are primarily comprised of integration related activities, including professional fees for project management, accounting, tax and other consulting\nservices. Transaction related costs primarily consist of investment banking fees, legal expenses and due diligence costs incurred in connection with the\ncompletion of the transaction. Other costs includes payroll related costs including retention, stock compensation, relocation and travel expenses incurred\nas part of the integration of TS. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, other costs are partially offset by a gain of $9.6 million related to the final\nworking capital adjustment for the acquisition of TS as part of a settlement agreement with Avnet.\nWe incurred no acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses related to the acquisition of TS during the years ended January 31, 2021 or January 31,\n2020 and do not expect to incur any additional costs in future periods.

We have reached settlement agreements during the periods presented and have recorded these amounts net\nof attorney fees and other expenses, in \u201clegal settlements and other litigation, net\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nGain on Bargain Purchase\nOn September 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Innovix for a preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $52 million. We have\naccounted for the acquisition as a business combination and allocated the preliminary estimated purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the estimated fair values of the net tangible assets over the preliminary estimated purchase price was\nrecorded as a gain on bargain purchase of $30.2 million on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.\nGain On Sale Of Fixed Assets\nSale-leaseback Transactions\nDuring fiscal 2021 we executed sale-leaseback transactions for an office facility and five logistics facilities that we previously owned throughout the\nUnited States, resulting in net cash proceeds of $272.7 million. These transactions qualified as sales for accounting purposes and resulted in a net gain of\n$20.1 million which is included in \u201cgain on sale of fixed assets\u201d on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 1, 2020 to\nJanuary 31, 2021.\nSale of Facility\nDuring fiscal 2021, we sold one of our logistics facilities located in the United States for net cash proceeds of $42.2 million.

The\ndecrease in the absolute dollar value of the provision for income taxes as compared to the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in taxable earnings, as\nwell as the net impact of the aforementioned items.\n2020 - 2019 Commentary\nThe increase in both the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the impact of the\nfollowing:\n \n \n\u2022\n In fiscal 2019, we finalized our analysis of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform and decreased our estimate of the one-time\ntransition tax by $49.2 million.\n \n \n\u2022\n In fiscal 2019, we recorded income tax benefits of $13.0 million in relation to a settlement agreement reached with Avnet.\n \n \n\u2022\n In fiscal 2019, we recorded income tax benefits of $9.6 million due to the resolution of certain pre-acquisition tax matters related to TS.\n \n \n\u2022\n In fiscal 2019, we recorded income tax benefits of $6.0 million related to changes in deferred tax valuation allowances.\nAdditionally, the increase in the absolute dollar value of the provision for income taxes as compared to the prior year is due to an increase in taxable\nearnings. The change in the effective tax rate was also impacted by goodwill impairment expense in fiscal 2019 which was not deductible for tax purposes\nand the relative mix of earnings and losses within the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (which we refer to as \u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d) which significantly\nrevised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a\nmodified territorial tax system that included a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The SEC provided\naccounting and reporting guidance that allowed us to report provisional amounts within a measurement period up to one year due to the complexities\ninherent in adopting the changes. Accordingly, in fiscal 2018, we recorded our provisional estimate of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we finalized our analysis of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform and decreased our estimate of the one-time transition tax by\n$49.2 million, primarily due to further analysis of earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries and the utilization of foreign tax credits.\n \n141\nTable of Contents\nTax Indemnifications\nIn connection with the acquisition of TS, pursuant to the interest purchase agreement, the Company and Avnet agreed to indemnify each other in relation\nto certain tax matters. As a result, we have recorded certain indemnification assets and liabilities for expected amounts to be received from and paid to\nAvnet. During the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, due to the resolution of certain pre-acquisition tax matters and the expiration of certain\nstatutes of limitation, we recorded benefits in income tax expense of\n$0.6 million, $1.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively. As a result, we recorded expenses of $0.6 million, $1.2 million and $9.6 million during the years\nended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in \u201cselling, general and administrative expenses\u201d in the Consolidated Statement\nof Operations, related to changes in the corresponding indemnification assets and liabilities recorded.

Also providing us liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents balances across our regions which are deposited and/or\ninvested with various financial institutions. We are exposed to risk of loss on funds deposited with these financial institutions\u037e however, we monitor our\nfinancing and depository financial institution partners regularly for credit quality. Our liquidity is subject to many factors, including the potential impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets\u037e however, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including our financing facilities, trade credit\nfrom vendors, cash resources, as well as cash expected to be provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and\ncash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nWe currently have sufficient resources, cash flows and liquidity within the U.S. to fund current and expected future working capital requirements.\nHowever, during the year we were able to repatriate foreign cash, along with the majority of our remaining foreign earnings which have been previously\ntaxed, with minimal additional tax consequences. We plan to continue reinvesting future foreign earnings indefinitely outside the U.S. Any future\nremittances of foreign cash could be subject to additional foreign withholding tax, U.S. state taxes and certain tax impacts relating to foreign currency\nexchange effects.\n \n144\nTable of Contents\nFor a discussion of our various financing arrangements, refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccounts receivable purchase agreements\nWe have uncommitted accounts receivable purchase agreements under which certain accounts receivable may be sold, without recourse, to third-party\nfinancial institutions. Under these programs, we may sell certain accounts receivable in exchange for cash less a discount, as defined in the agreements.\nAvailable capacity under these programs, which we use as a source of working capital funding, is dependent on the level of accounts receivable eligible\nto be sold into these programs and the financial institutions\u2019 willingness to purchase such receivables, which may be impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic. In addition, certain of these agreements also require that we continue to service, administer and collect the sold accounts receivable. At\nJanuary 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a total of $691.9 million and $739.2 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold to and held by financial institutions\nunder these agreements. During the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2020 and 2019, discount fees recorded under these facilities were $5.6 million, $4.4 million, $15.9 million and $14.9 million, respectively,\nwhich are included as a component of \u201cother expense, net\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn October 2018, Tech Data\u2019s Board of Directors (which we refer to as \u201cTech Data Board\u201d) authorized a share repurchase program for up to $200.0 million\nof our common stock. In February 2019, Tech Data Board approved a $100.0 million increase to the program. In August 2019, Tech Data Board authorized\nthe repurchase of up to an additional $200.0 million of our common stock, resulting in a total share repurchase authorization of $500.0 million. In\nconjunction with our share repurchase program, a 10b5-1 plan was executed that instructed the broker selected by the Company to repurchase shares on\nour behalf. The amount of common stock repurchased in accordance with the 10b5-1 plan on any given trading day was determined by a formula in the\nplan, which was based on the market price of our common stock. Shares we repurchased were held in treasury for general corporate purposes, including\nissuances under equity incentive and benefit plans.\nWe repurchased 1,723,081 shares of our common stock at a cost of $170.2 million during the year ended January 31, 2020 and 1,429,154 shares of our\ncommon stock at a cost of $107.0 million during the year ended January 31, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement with the affiliates of\nApollo Funds, we suspended our share repurchase program as of November 13, 2019.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements",

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing\nstandards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures\nselected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nfraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity\u2019s preparation and fair presentation of the\nfinancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the entity\u2019s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of\naccounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation\nof the financial statements.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\nOpinion\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tiger Parent (AP)\nCorporation and subsidiaries at January 31, 2021 (Successor)

Business And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nOn November 12, 2019, Tech Data Corporation entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as subsequently amended on November 27, 2019 (the\n\u2018\u2018Merger Agreement\u2019\u2019), with Tiger Midco, LLC (\u201cTiger Midco\u201d) and Tiger Merger Sub Co. (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d). Tiger Midco and Merger Sub are affiliates of\ncertain funds (the \u201cApollo Funds\u201d), managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management Inc. (\u201cApollo\u201d). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Tiger Midco\nagreed to acquire all the outstanding shares of Tech Data Corporation\u2019s common stock (other than shares held by Tech Data Corporation as treasury\nstock or held by certain affiliates of the Apollo Funds) for $145 per share in cash. On June 30, 2020, Merger Sub merged with and into Tech Data\nCorporation (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with Tech Data Corporation surviving the Merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Tiger Midco (see Note 4 \u2013\nAcquisitions for additional information).\nTiger Parent, LLC was formed on November 6, 2019 and was converted to Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation in June 2020. Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation,\nthrough its wholly-owned subsidiaries including Tiger Midco, is the parent company of Tech Data Corporation subsequent to the Merger. The\nconsolidated financial statements include the consolidated results of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation from the date of the Merger through January 31, 2021\n(the \u201csuccessor period\u201d) and the consolidated results of Tech Data Corporation for periods prior to the Merger on June 30, 2020 (the \u201cpredecessor\nperiod\u201d). References to the \u201cCompany\u201d indicate Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation and its subsidiaries for periods subsequent to the date of the Merger and\nTech Data Corporation and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the Merger.\nThe Company is one of the world\u2019s largest IT distribution and solutions companies. The Company serves a critical role in the center of the IT ecosystem,\nbringing products from the world\u2019s leading technology vendors to market, as well as helping customers create solutions best suited to maximize business\noutcomes for their end-user customers. The Company\u2019s customers include value-added resellers, direct marketers, retailers, corporate resellers and\nmanaged service providers who support the diverse technology needs of end users. The Company manages its business in three geographic regions\u037e the\nAmericas, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation and its subsidiaries during the successor period and Tech\nData Corporation and its subsidiaries during the predecessor period. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation. The Company operates on a fiscal year that ends on January 31.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.\n(\u201cGAAP\u201d). These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe Merger is being accounted for as a business combination using the purchase method of accounting. As a result of the application of purchase\naccounting, the consolidated financial statements for the successor period are not comparable to those of the predecessor period.\n \n159\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company\u2019s revenues primarily result from the sale of various technology products and services. The Company recognizes revenue as control of\nproducts is transferred to customers, which generally happens at the point of shipment. Products sold by the Company are delivered via shipment from\nthe Company\u2019s facilities, drop-shipment directly from the vendor, or by electronic delivery of keys for software products. In relation to product support,\nsupply chain management and other services performed by the Company, revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. Service revenues\nand related contract liabilities were not material for the periods presented.\nThe Company has contracts with certain customers where the Company\u2019s performance obligation is to arrange for the products or services to be\nprovided by another party. In these arrangements, as the Company assumes an agency relationship in the transaction, revenue is recognized in the\namount of the net fee associated with serving as an agent. These arrangements primarily relate to certain fulfillment contracts, as well as sales of software\nservices and extended warranty services.\nThe Company allows its customers to exchange product or return for credit subject to certain limitations. A liability is recorded at the time of sale for\nestimated product returns based upon historical experience and an asset is recognized for the amount expected to be recorded in inventory upon product\nreturn. The Company also provides volume rebates and other discounts to certain customers which are considered variable consideration. A provision\nfor customer rebates and other discounts is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale based on an evaluation of the contract terms and\nhistorical experience.\nThe Company considers shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill the sales of products. Shipping revenue is included in net sales when control\nof the product is transferred to the customer, and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products sold. Taxes imposed by\ngovernmental authorities on the Company\u2019s revenue producing activities with customers, such as sales taxes and value added taxes, are excluded from\nnet sales.\nThe Company disaggregates its revenue by geography, which the Company believes provides a meaningful depiction of the nature of its revenue. Net\nsales includes service revenues, which are not a significant component of total revenue and are aggregated within the respective geographies. The\nfollowing table sets forth the Company\u2019s disaggregated net sales (in thousands):\n \n \n  \nSuccessor\n   \n    \nPredecessor\n \n  \nJuly 1, 2020 through\nJanuary 31, 2021\n   \n    \nFebruary 1, 2020\nthrough June\n30,\n2020\n   \nYear ended\nJanuary 31, 2020   \nYear ended\nJanuary 31, 2019 \nAmericas\n  \n$\n9,614,214   \n    \n$\n6,296,894   \n$\n16,600,023   \n$\n16,041,103 \nEurope\n  \n \n12,536,531   \n    \n \n6,634,549   \n \n19,132,040   \n \n20,026,057 \nAsia-Pacific\n  \n \n862,313   \n    \n \n428,113   \n \n1,266,358   \n \n1,171,790 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal\n  \n$\n23,013,058   \n   \n$\n13,359,556   \n$\n36,998,421   \n$\n37,238,950 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following table provides a comparison of sales generated from products purchased from vendors that exceeded 10% of the Company\u2019s consolidated\nnet sales for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, and the years ended January 31, 2020 and\nJanuary 31, 2019 (as a percent of consolidated net sales):\n \n \n  \nSuccessor\n \n \n    \nPredecessor\n \n  \nJuly 1, 2020 through\nJanuary 31, 2021\n \n \n    \nFebruary 1, 2020\nthrough June 30,\n2020\n \n \nYear ended\nJanuary 31, 2020 \n \nYear ended\nJanuary 31, 2019 \nApple Inc.\n  \n \n19%  \n    \n \n15%  \n \n16%  \n \n16% \nCisco Systems, Inc.\n  \n \n9%  \n    \n \n1\n1%  \n \n10%  \n \n1\n1% \nHP Inc.\n  \n \n9%  \n    \n \n1\n1%  \n \n10%  \n \n1\n1% \n \n160\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nShort-term investments which are highly liquid and have an original maturity of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents.\nInvestments\nPrior to the Merger, the Company invested in life insurance policies to fund the Company\u2019s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The life insurance\nasset recorded by the Company was the amount that would be realized upon the assumed surrender of the policy. This amount was based on the\nunderlying fair value of the invested assets contained within the life insurance policies. The gains and losses were recorded in the Company\u2019s\nConsolidated Statement of Operations within \u201cother expense, net.\u201d\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable for future expected credit losses resulting from the inability or\nunwillingness of its customers to make required payments. In estimating the required allowance, the Company takes into consideration historical credit\nlosses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current\nconditions as well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates or gross domestic product growth.\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist using an age-based reserve model. Receivables that do not\nshare risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses (in thousands):\n \nBalance at January 31, 2019 (predecessor)\n  \n$ 73,270 \nAdditions\n  \n 21,081 \nDeductions\n  \n (19,252) \nRecoveries\n  \n \n5,146 \nOther (1)\n  \n \n(805) \n \n \n \n \n \nBalance at January 31, 2020 (predecessor)\n  \n$ 79,440 \nAdditions\n  \n 24,984 \nDeductions\n  \n (25,223) \nRecoveries\n  \n \n7,400 \nOther (1)\n  \n \n312 \n \n \n \n \n \nBalance at January 31, 2021 (successor)\n  \n$ 86,913 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1)\n\u201cOther\u201d primarily includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currencies.\nThe Company has uncommitted accounts receivable purchase agreements under which certain accounts receivable may be sold, without recourse, to\nthird-party financial institutions. Under these programs, the Company may sell certain accounts receivable in exchange for cash less a discount, as\ndefined in the agreements. Available capacity under these programs, which the Company uses as a source of working capital funding, is dependent on\nthe level of accounts receivable eligible to be sold into these programs and the financial institutions\u2019 willingness to purchase such receivables. In\naddition, certain of these agreements also require that the Company continue to service, administer and collect the sold accounts receivable. At\nJanuary 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a total of $691.9 million and $739.2 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold to and held by financial\ninstitutions under these agreements. Discount fees recorded under these facilities, which are included as a component of \u201cother expense, net\u201d in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations, were $5.6 million, $4.4 million, $15.9 million and $14.9 million for the period from July 1, 2020 to\nJanuary 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n \n161\nTable of Contents\nInventories\nInventories, consisting entirely of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on a moving average cost\nbasis. Inventory is written down for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value, based\nupon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand, specifically known inventory-related risks (such as technological obsolescence and the nature of\nvendor terms surrounding price protection and product returns), foreign currency fluctuations for foreign-sourced products and assumptions about\nfuture demand.\nVendor Programs\nThe Company participates in various vendor programs under which the vendor may provide certain incentives such as cooperative advertising\nallowances, infrastructure funding, more favorable payment terms, early pay discounts and rebate arrangements. These programs are generally under\nquarterly, semi-annual or annual agreements with the vendors\u037e however, some of these programs are negotiated on an ad-hoc basis mutually developed\nwith the vendor. Volume rebates and early payment discounts received from vendors are recorded when they are earned as a reduction of inventory and\nas a reduction of cost of products sold as the related inventory is sold. Vendor incentives for specifically identified cooperative advertising programs and\ninfrastructure funding are recorded when earned as adjustments to cost of products sold or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on\nthe nature of the program.\nAllowances for credit losses on receivables related to vendor programs are recorded for estimated losses resulting from vendors\u2019 inability to pay,\nrejections of claims by vendors and other risk characteristics including historical credit losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current conditions as well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic\nconditions, such as changes in unemployment rates or gross domestic product growth.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation expense includes depreciation of purchased property and equipment. Depreciation expense is\ncomputed over the shorter of the estimated economic lives or lease periods using the straight-line method, generally as follows:\n \n \n  \nYears\nBuildings and improvements\n  \n15 - 39\nLeasehold improvements\n  \n3 - 10\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n  \n3 - 10\nExpenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations when incurred. When assets are sold or retired, the cost of the asset and the related\naccumulated depreciation are eliminated and any gain or loss is recognized at such time. The Company also examines the carrying value of its property\nand equipment for potential impairment as current events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.\nIntangible Assets, net\nIncluded within \u201cintangible assets, net,\u201d at January 31, 2021 are capitalized software and development costs, as well as customer relationships. Such\ncapitalized costs and intangible assets are being amortized over a period of three years to fifteen years. The Company examines the carrying value of its\nintangible assets with finite lives, for potential impairment as current events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be\nrecoverable. Additionally, included within intangible assets are the Company\u2019s trade name intangibles. Trade name intangible assets are indefinite lived\nintangible assets that are tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not\nthat the asset is impaired.\n \n162\nTable of Contents\nPrior to the Merger, \u201cintangible assets, net\u201d included capitalized software and development costs, as well as customer and vendor relationships, trade\nnames and other intangible assets acquired in connection with various business acquisitions. These capitalized costs and intangible assets were being\namortized over a period of three years to fifteen years.\nThe Company\u2019s capitalized software has been obtained or developed for internal use only. Development and acquisition costs are capitalized for\ncomputer software only when management authorizes and commits to funding a computer software project through the approval of a capital expenditure\nrequisition, and the software project is either for the development of new software, to increase the life of existing software or to add significantly to the\nfunctionality of existing software. Once these requirements have been met, capitalization would begin at the point that conceptual formulation,\nevaluation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed. Capitalization ceases when the software project is\nsubstantially complete and ready for its intended use. The Company\u2019s accounting policy is to amortize capitalized software costs on a straight-line basis\nover periods ranging from three years to ten years, depending upon the nature of the software, the stability of the hardware platform on which the\nsoftware is installed, its fit in the Company\u2019s overall strategy and the Company\u2019s experience with similar software.\nPrepaid maintenance fees associated with a software application are accounted for separately from the related software and amortized over the life of the\nmaintenance agreement. General, administrative, overhead, training, non-development data conversion processes, and maintenance costs, as well as the\ncosts associated with the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs an annual review for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill, or more frequently if current events and\ncircumstances indicate a possible impairment. For purposes of its goodwill analysis, the Company has three reporting units based on its geographic\nregions: the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The Company evaluates the appropriateness of performing a qualitative assessment, on a reporting unit\nlevel, based on current circumstances. If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is greater than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will not be performed. The factors that are considered in the qualitative analysis\ninclude macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors such as increases in product cost, labor, or other costs that would\nhave a negative effect on earnings and cash flows and other relevant entity-specific events and information.\nIf the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative\nimpairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test compares the fair values of the Company\u2019s reporting units with their carrying amounts,\nincluding goodwill. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. The assumptions used in the\nmarket approach are based on the value of a business through an analysis of multiples of guideline companies and recent sales or offerings of a\ncomparable entity. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow approach are based on historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, working\ncapital requirements, economic conditions and other relevant factors. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment\ncharge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value, only to the extent of the carrying value of\ngoodwill allocated to that reporting unit (see Note 3 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further discussion).\nTransactions with Related Parties\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company has entered into certain transactions with its parent, Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P. (the \u201cParent\u201d) and certain\naffiliates of Apollo, including a management fee agreement. Fees\n \n163\nTable of Contents\nincurred under the management fee agreement were $4.8 million for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 and are included in \u201cselling, general\nand administrative expenses\u201d on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, the Company incurred expenses for the period from July 1, 2020\nto January 31, 2021 of approximately $50 million for transaction related services provided by certain affiliates of Apollo and $8.7 million for the\nreimbursement of transaction costs incurred by certain affiliates of Apollo which are recorded in \u201cacquisition, integration and restructuring expenses\u201d in\nthe Consolidated Statement of Operations. At January 31, 2021, the Company had amounts payable to the Parent of $6.2 million primarily related to\ntransaction costs associated with the completion of the Merger, which are included in \u201caccrued expenses and other liabilities\u201d on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\nOn June 30, 2020, the Parent contributed approximately $3.7 billion as equity to Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation in conjunction with the closing of the\nMerger. The Company provided a return of capital to the Parent in the amount of $924.9 million during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.\nProduct Warranty\nThe Company\u2019s vendors generally warrant the products distributed by the Company and allow the Company to return defective products, including\nthose that have been returned to the Company by its customers. The Company typically does not independently warrant the products it distributes\u037e\nhowever, in several countries where the Company operates, the Company is responsible for defective product as a matter of law. The time period required\nby law in certain countries exceeds the warranty period provided by the manufacturer. The Company is obligated to provide warranty protection for sales\nof certain IT products within the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) for up to two years as required under the EU directive where vendors have not affirmatively\nagreed to provide pass-through protection. In addition to situations where pass-through protection is required by law, the Company does warrant\nservices with regard to products integrated for its customers. A provision for estimated warranty costs is recorded at the time of sale and periodically\nadjusted to reflect actual experience. To date, the Company has not incurred any significant warranty costs related to either legal requirements or\nservices.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company\u2019s calculation of income taxes is based on current enacted tax laws and tax rates of each tax jurisdiction. Due to the Company\u2019s global\nstructure, the estimation and calculation of income taxes involves the interpretation and application of complex statutes, regulations, and case law in\nmultiple jurisdictions, including the income tax impact of the legal entity ownership structure, which are subject to legal and factual interpretation and\njudgment.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which\nthe differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the fiscal period\nthat includes the enactment date.\nThe Company considers all positive and negative evidence available in determining the potential realization of deferred tax assets, including the\nscheduled reversal of temporary differences, recent cumulative losses, recent and projected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning\nstrategies. In making this determination, the Company places greater emphasis on recent cumulative losses and recent taxable income due to the inherent\nlack of subjectivity associated with these factors. In addition, the Company is subject to the periodic examination of its income tax returns by the Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to\ndetermine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.\n \n164\nTable of Contents\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments, which are subject to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable and foreign currency exchange contracts. The Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents are deposited and/or invested with various financial\ninstitutions globally that are monitored on a regular basis by the Company for credit quality.\nThe Company sells its products to a large base of value-added resellers, direct marketers, retailers, corporate resellers and managed service providers.\nThe Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company has obtained credit insurance\nwhich insures a percentage of credit extended by the Company to certain of its customers against possible loss. The Company maintains provisions for\nestimated credit losses. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s net sales during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31,\n2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company also enters into foreign currency exchange contracts. In the event of a failure to honor one of these contracts by one of the banks with\nwhich the Company has contracted, the Company believes any loss would be limited in most circumstances to the exchange rate differential from the time\nthe contract was executed until the time the contract was settled. The Company\u2019s foreign currency exchange contracts are executed with various financial\ninstitutions globally and are monitored on a regular basis by the Company for credit quality.\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\nThe assets and liabilities of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency are translated into U.S. dollars\nusing the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using weighted average exchange rates for\neach period during the year. Translation gains and losses are reported as components of \u201caccumulated other comprehensive income\u201d, included within\nshareholders\u2019 equity in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in the Company\u2019s\nConsolidated Statement of Operations.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nPrior to the Merger, Merger Sub entered into two interest rate swaps in order to hedge the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on expected borrowings\nunder the Asset Based Credit Agreement in conjunction with the closing of the Merger. Upon the closing of the Merger, the Company assumed these\ninterest rate swaps which convert the interest payable on the Asset Based Credit Agreement Term Loans from a variable rate to a fixed rate. The interest\nrate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company also previously held a cross-currency swap that was designated as a cash flow hedge to\nhedge its cash flows related to certain foreign-currency denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated\nand qualifying as cash flow hedges is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). These gains and losses are subsequently\nreclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and are presented in the same statement of operations\nline item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. The Company has classified cash flows related to its interest rate swaps as operating activities and\ncash flows related to the settlement of its cross-currency swap as financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe Company previously used foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of its net\ninvestment in foreign-currency denominated operations. The Company terminated these net investment hedges during the period from February 1, 2020\nto June 30, 2020. Gains and losses on net investment hedges resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates compared to those per the forward contract\nwere recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) during the predecessor period.\n \n165\nTable of Contents\nAmounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as of June 30, 2020 were eliminated as part of purchase accounting in conjunction with\nthe Merger. Prior to the termination of the net investment hedges, the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of\neffectiveness was recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument in interest expense, net on the Consolidated\nStatement of Operations. The Company classified cash flows related to the settlement of its net investment hedges as investing activities in the\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe Company additionally utilizes forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to reduce exposure to foreign currency risk. The\nderivative instruments are marked-to-market each period with gains and losses on these contracts recorded in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of\nOperations within \u201ccost of products sold\u201d for derivative instruments used to manage the Company\u2019s exposure to foreign denominated accounts\nreceivable and accounts payable and within \u201cother expense, net,\u201d for derivative instruments used to manage the Company\u2019s exposure to foreign\ndenominated financing transactions. Such mark-to-market gains and losses are recorded in the period in which their value changes, with the offsetting\nentry for unsettled positions being recorded to either \u201cprepaid expenses and other assets\u201d or \u201caccrued expenses and other liabilities\u201d in the Company\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The Company classifies cash flows related to the settlement of forward contracts that are not designated as hedging\ninstruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce risk where appropriate and prohibit entering into derivative financial\ninstruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and\ncircumstances from non-owner sources, and is comprised of \u201cnet income\u201d and \u201cother comprehensive income (loss).\u201d The Company\u2019s \u201caccumulated other\ncomprehensive income\u201d is comprised of changes in the Company\u2019s currency translation adjustment account and the effective portion of changes in the\nfair value of its cash flow hedges.\nStock-Based Compensation\nPrior to the Merger, the Company awarded certain employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors restricted stock, options to purchase\ncommon stock, stock appreciation rights and performance awards that were dependent upon achievement of specified performance goals. Subsequent to\nthe Merger, certain of the Company\u2019s employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors have been granted equity awards in the Parent.\nThe Company records expenses for all equity-based awards, including employee awards and non-employee director awards related to the Parent, in\noperating expenses in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations based on their fair values determined on the date of grant. The Company\nrecognizes stock-based compensation expense for awards other than performance-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period\nof the award. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost associated with performance-based awards over the requisite service period if it\nis probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. Stock-based compensation expense includes an estimate for forfeitures based on the\nCompany\u2019s historical experience.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock for the predecessor entity was accounted for at cost. Shares that were repurchased by the Company prior to the Merger were held in\ntreasury for general corporate purposes, including issuances under equity incentive and benefit plans. The reissuance of shares from treasury stock was\nbased on the weighted average purchase price of the shares. The Company\u2019s treasury stock was eliminated during the Merger.\nContingencies\nThe Company accrues for contingent obligations, including estimated legal costs, when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably\nestimable. As facts concerning contingencies become known, the Company\n \n166\nTable of Contents\nreassesses its position and makes appropriate adjustments to the financial statements. Estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include\nthose related to tax, legal and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports, the imposition of international governmental controls, changes in the\ninterpretation and enforcement of international laws (particularly related to items such as duty and taxation), and the impact of local economic conditions\nand practices, which are all subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation\nprocess.\nLegal settlements and other litigation, net\nThe Company has been a claimant in proceedings seeking damages from certain manufacturers of LCD flat panel and cathode ray tube displays as well as\nreimbursement from insurance providers of certain costs incurred by the Company associated with the restatement of certain of the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements and other financial information from fiscal 2009 to 2013. The Company reached settlement agreements during the\nperiods presented and has recorded these amounts, net of attorney fees and expenses, in \u201clegal settlements and other litigation, net,\u201d in the Consolidated\nStatement of Operations.\nThe Company is also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business (see Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies for further information).\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 which revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of the\nrecognition of those losses. Under the new standard, financial assets measured at an amortized cost basis are to be presented net of the amount not\nexpected to be collected via an allowance for credit losses. Estimated credit losses are to be based on historical information adjusted for management\u2019s\nexpectation that current conditions and supportable forecasts differ from historical experience. The Company adopted this standard during the quarter\nending April 30, 2020. The adoption of this standard had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 which provides optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform on\nfinancial reporting. This guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying existing guidance to contract modifications, hedging\nrelationships and other transactions that are expected to be affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. The amendments in the guidance\nare elective and were effective beginning March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 to refine the scope\nof the March 2020 accounting standard and clarify some of its guidance as part of the FASB\u2019s monitoring of global reference rate activities. The\namendments in this guidance were effective immediately for all entities. The company adopted the provisions of ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 on a\nprospective basis and the adoption had no material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 which simplifies and clarifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance. The accounting\nstandard is effective for the Company beginning in its fiscal year 2022, with early adoption permitted. Certain amendments should be applied\nprospectively, while other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presents. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this\nnew standard.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events through April 16, 2021, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.\n \n167\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 2 \u2014 Property and Equipment, Net\nThe Company\u2019s property and equipment (in thousands) consists of the following:\n \n \n  Successor       \nPredecessor \n \n  \nJanuary 31,\n2021\n      \nJanuary 31,\n2020\n \nLand\n  $\n10,682     $\n43,627 \nBuildings and leasehold improvements\n   \n78,971       \n236,258 \nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n   \n96,149       \n339,491 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProperty and equipment\n   \n185,802      \n619,376 \nLess: accumulated depreciation\n   \n(23,770)      \n(332,226) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProperty and equipment, net\n  $\n162,032     $\n287,150 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs a result of the Merger, the Company recorded its property and equipment at fair value as of June 30, 2020 (see Note 4 \u2013 Acquisitions for additional\ninformation). During the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the Company sold one of its logistics facilities and further executed sale-leaseback\ntransactions for an office facility and five other logistics facilities which were accounted for as sales (see Note 6 \u2013 Sale of Fixed Assets and Disposal of\nSubsidiary for further information). Depreciation expense totaled $23.4 million, $15.3 million, $35.7 million and $34.4 million for the period from July 1, 2020\nto January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n \n168\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 3 \u2014 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, are as follows (in thousands):\n \nPredecessor:\n  \nBalance as of January 31, 2020\n  $\n973,257 \nAcquisition adjustments\n   \n14,592 \nForeign currency translation\n   \n(3,899) \n \n \n \n \n \nBalance as of June 30, 2020\n  $\n983,950 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuccessor:\n  \nPurchase accounting adjustments related to Merger\n  $\n(983,950) \nAcquisitions\n   \n1,488,403 \nForeign currency translation\n   \n54,952 \n \n \n \n \n \nBalance as of January 31, 2021\n  $\n1,543,355 \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Company\u2019s annual goodwill impairment tests for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were performed as of November 1, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and did not\nresult in an impairment. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2019 as of November 1, 2018 which indicated that the\ncarrying value of the Company\u2019s Asia-Pacific reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. In estimating the fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting\nunit, a discounted cash flow approach and market approach were utilized. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow approach were based on\nhistorical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, working capital requirements, economic conditions and other relevant factors. The assumptions used\nin the market approach were based on the value of a business through an analysis of multiples of guideline companies and recent sales or offerings of a\ncomparable entity. The estimated fair value developed under the discounted cash flow and market approaches decreased in comparison to the Company\u2019s\nprior estimates primarily due to lower operating results and increased investments in the region as compared to expectations. As a result, goodwill\nimpairment expense of $47.4 million was recorded during the year ended January 31, 2019, representing the amount by which the carrying value of the\nAsia-Pacific reporting unit exceeded its fair value.\nThe Company\u2019s intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):\n \n \n \nSuccessor\n    \nPredecessor\n \n \n \nJanuary 31, 2021\n    \nJanuary 31, 2020\n \n \n \nGross\ncarrying\namount\n  \nAccumulated\namortization   \nNet book\nvalue\n    \nGross\ncarrying\namount\n  \nAccumulated\namortization   \nNet book\nvalue\n \nIntangible assets with indefinite lives:\n \n \n \n    \n \n \nTrade names\n $\n652,020  $\n\u2014   $\n652,020    $\n\u2014   $\n\u2014   $\n\u2014  \nIntangible assets with finite lives:\n \n \n \n    \n \n \nCustomer and vendor relationships\n  2,204,269   \n(92,443)   \n2,111,826      1,252,393   \n(328,878)   \n923,515\nCapitalized software and\ndevelopment costs\n  \n188,360   \n(23,210)   \n165,150      \n482,399   \n(349,033)   \n133,366\nOther intangible assets\n  \n\u2014     \n\u2014     \n\u2014        \n101,743   \n(63,948)   \n37,795\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal\n $ 3,044,649  $\n(115,653)  $ 2,928,996    $ 1,836,535  $\n(741,859)  $ 1,094,676\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn connection with the Merger, the Company\u2019s intangible assets were revalued at fair value as of June 30, 2020 and allocated to trade names, customer\nrelationships and capitalized software and development costs\u037e as of January 31, 2021, the Company did not have any other intangible assets.

Tiger Midco, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation, acquired\nall the outstanding shares of Tech Data Corporation\u2019s common stock (other than shares held by Tech Data Corporation as treasury stock or held by\ncertain affiliates of the Apollo Funds) for $145 per share in cash. Additionally, per the terms of the Merger Agreement, all nonvested restricted stock units\n(\u201cRSU\u2019s\u201d) were vested, cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount of $145 per share in cash. Nonvested performance based restricted\nstock units (\u201cPRSU\u2019s\u201d) were also cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount of $145 per share in cash determined as follows: (i) for\nPRSU\u2019s granted during fiscal 2019, the number of shares equaled 130% of the target shares granted and (ii) for PRSU\u2019s granted during fiscal 2020, the\nnumber of shares equaled 110% of the target shares granted. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $5.2 billion.\nThe Parent contributed approximately $3.7 billion as equity to Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation in conjunction with the Merger, of which approximately\n$3.6 billion was used to fund the purchase price for Tech Data Corporation. The remaining purchase price for Tech Data Corporation was financed\nthrough the issuance of debt (see Note 7 \u2013 Debt for further discussion) and cash on hand at Tech Data Corporation.\nThe Company has accounted for the Merger as a business combination and allocated the purchase price to the estimated fair values of Tech Data\nCorporation\u2019s assets and liabilities. The Company has not yet completed its evaluation and determination of certain assets and liabilities, primarily (i) the\nfinal assessment and valuation of certain assets and liabilities, including accounts receivable and accounts payable and (iii) the final assessment and\nvaluation of certain income tax amounts.

The Innovix acquisition expands the Company\u2019s presence across\nthe Asia-Pacific region and strengthens its Endpoint Solutions and Advanced Solutions capabilities.\nThe Company has accounted for the acquisition as a business combination and allocated the preliminary estimated purchase price to the estimated fair\nvalues of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including cash of approximately $21 million, accounts receivable of approximately $121 million,\ninventory of approximately $41 million and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of approximately $107 million. The excess of\nthe estimated fair values of the net tangible assets over the preliminary estimated purchase price was recorded as a gain on bargain purchase of\n$30.2 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. The Company acquired the net assets of\nInnovix for an amount less than fair value as its former parent decided to exit this business after it concluded that Innovix represented an insignificant,\nnon-strategic portion of its consolidated operations.\nThe Company has not yet completed its evaluation and determination of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed, primarily (i) the final assessment\nand valuation of certain other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including accounts receivable, inventory, accrued expenses and other liabilities and\n(ii) the final assessment and valuation of certain tax amounts. Therefore, the final fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may vary from\nthe Company\u2019s preliminary estimates. Pro forma information for the acquisition of Innovix has not been provided as the acquisition was not material to the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nDLT Acquisition\nOn November 25, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of DLT, a premier software and cloud solutions aggregator focused on the U.S. public\nsector.

The ABL facilities constitute senior debt of the Company that is secured by a first priority lien\nby a pledge of Tech Data Corporation\u2019s capital stock directly held by Tiger Midco and first-priority security interests in substantially all of Tech Data\nCorporation\u2019s accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles (other than intellectual property), bank accounts and cash, and books and records\nrelated to the foregoing, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe ABL Revolver provides for (i) a maturity date of June 30, 2025 (ii) an interest rate on borrowings, facility fees and letter of credit fees based on\naverage availability under the ABL Revolver and (iii) certain subsidiaries of the Company to be designated as borrowers. The applicable borrower pays\ninterest on advances under the ABL Revolver based on LIBOR (or similar interbank offered rate depending on currency draw) plus a predetermined\nmargin that is based on the Company\u2019s average revolving availability. There was $31.2 million outstanding under the ABL Revolver at January 31, 2021, at\nan interest rate of 1.50%.\nThe Non-FILO Term Loan and FILO Term Loan (collectively, the \u201cABL Term Loans\u201d) have a maturity date of June 30, 2025. The Company pays interest at\na variable rate based on LIBOR (or similar interbank offered rate depending on currency draw) plus, in each case, a fixed predetermined margin. The\nCompany entered into two interest rate swaps which convert the interest payable on the ABL Term Loans from a variable rate to a fixed rate (see Note 11 \u2013\nDerivative Instruments for further discussion). The Company must repay 0.25% of the original principal amount of the ABL Term Loans on a quarterly\nbasis. Any refinancing through the issuance of certain debt or any repricing amendment, in either case, that constitutes a \u201crepricing event\u201d applicable to\nthe ABL Term Loans resulting in a lower yield will be accompanied by a 1.00% prepayment premium or fee, as applicable, if any such repricing event\noccurs, (i) with respect to the Non-FILO Term Loan, at any time during the first six months after the closing date of the ABL and (ii) with respect to the\nFILO Term Loan, at any time during the first twelve months after the closing date of the ABL. Otherwise, the ABL Term Loans may be repaid at any time,\nwithout premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs, except that, subject to certain exceptions, the FILO Term Loan may not be prepaid prior\nto the payment in full of any amounts outstanding under the ABL Revolver and the Non-FILO Term Loan. At January 31, 2021, the Company had\napproximately $1.7 billion outstanding under the Non-FILO Term Loan and $369.1 million outstanding under the FILO Term Loan.\n \n180\nTable of Contents\nThe ABL Revolver includes a springing financial maintenance covenant based on availability under the ABL Revolver. At January 31, 2021, the financial\nmaintenance covenant did not apply. In addition, the ABL contains covenants that would restrict the Company\u2019s ability to, among other things, incur\ncertain debt and liens, make certain dividends and other restricted payments, make certain investments, sell certain assets and enter into certain\ntransactions with affiliates. The ABL also contains certain customary events of default, including relating to a change of control. If an event of default\noccurs, the lenders under the ABL are entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL and all actions permitted\nto be taken by a secured creditor in respect of the collateral securing the ABL.\nOther Credit Facilities\nThe Company had a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) which, among other things, provided for (i) a\nmaturity date of May 15, 2024, (ii) an interest rate on borrowings, facility fees and letter of credit fees based on the Company\u2019s debt rating, (iii) the ability\nto increase the facility to a maximum of $1.75 billion, subject to certain conditions and (iv) certain subsidiaries of the Company to be designated as\nborrowers. The applicable borrower paid interest on advances under the Credit Agreement based on LIBOR (or similar interbank offered rates depending\non currency draw) plus a predetermined margin that was based on the Company\u2019s debt rating. There were no amounts outstanding under the Credit\nAgreement at January 31, 2020 and the Credit Agreement was terminated on June 30, 2020 as part of the Merger transaction.\nOn August 2, 2019, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement (the \u201c2019 Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) which, among other things,\n(i) provided for a $300 million term loan credit facility with a maturity date of August 2, 2021, (ii) provided for an interest rate on the outstanding principal\namount of the loan that was based on LIBOR plus a predetermined margin and (iii) was able to be increased up to a total of $500 million, subject to certain\nconditions. The Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2019 Term Loan Credit Agreement at January 31, 2020. On June 30, 2020, in conjunction\nwith the Merger, the Company repaid the $300 million outstanding and the 2019 Term Loan Credit Agreement was terminated.\nThe Company also had an agreement with a syndicate of banks (the \u201cReceivables Securitization Program\u201d) that allowed the Company to transfer an\nundivided interest in a designated pool of U.S. accounts receivable, on an ongoing basis, to provide collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of\n$1.0 billion. Under this program, the Company transferred certain U.S. trade receivables into a wholly- owned bankruptcy remote special purpose entity.\nSuch receivables, which were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled approximately $1.6 billion at January 31, 2020. As collections reduced\naccounts receivable balances included in the collateral pool, the Company was able to transfer interests in new receivables to bring the amount available\nto be borrowed up to the maximum. Interest was paid on advances under the Receivables Securitization Program at the applicable commercial paper or\nLIBOR rate plus an agreed-upon margin. There were no amounts outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Program at January 31, 2020. The\nReceivables Securitization Program was terminated on June 30, 2020 as part of the Merger transaction.\nIn addition to the facilities described above, the Company has various other committed and uncommitted lines of credit, short-term loans and overdraft\nfacilities totaling approximately $389.9 million at January 31, 2021 to support its operations. Most of these facilities are provided on an unsecured, short-\nterm basis and are reviewed periodically for renewal. There was $80.2 million outstanding on these facilities at January 31, 2021, at a weighted average\ninterest rate of 6.74%, and there was $108.4 million outstanding at January 31, 2020, at a weighted average interest rate of 6.79%.\nAt January 31, 2021, the Company had also issued standby letters of credit of $129.1 million. These letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of\npayment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions.\n \n181\nTable of Contents\nFuture payments of debt at January 31, 2021 and for succeeding fiscal years are as follows (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year:\n  \n \n \n2022\n  \n$\n132.1 \n2023\n  \n \n125.4 \n2024\n  \n \n21.1 \n2025\n  \n \n20.8 \n2026\n  \n 1,982.0 \nThereafter\n  \n \n132.4 \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal principal payments\n  \n$ 2,413.8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n182\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 8 \u2014 Income Taxes\nSignificant components of the provision for income taxes are as follows (in thousands):\n \n \n  \nSuccessor       \nPredecessor\n \n \n  \nJuly 1, 2020\nthrough\nJanuary 31,\n2021\n      \nFebruary 1,\n2020\nthrough\nJune 30,\n2020\n  \nYear ended\nJanuary 31,\n2020\n  \nYear ended\nJanuary 31,\n2019\n \nCurrent tax expense (benefit):\n     \nFederal\n  $\n19,582      \n$\n(3,266)  \n$\n18,366  \n$\n(9,564) \nState\n   \n9,476      \n \n(1,005)  \n \n10,171  \n \n5,846 \nForeign\n   \n41,255      \n \n11,568  \n \n62,314  \n \n48,905 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal current tax expense\n   \n70,313     \n \n7,297  \n \n90,851  \n \n45,187 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDeferred tax (benefit) expense:\n     \nFederal\n   \n(50,026)     \n \n9,975  \n \n19,617  \n \n(3,272) \nState\n   \n(11,366)     \n \n2,333  \n \n(451)  \n \n64 \nForeign\n   \n3,925     \n \n(410)  \n \n21  \n \n(9,274) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal deferred tax (benefit) expense\n   \n(57,467)     \n \n11,898  \n \n19,187  \n \n(12,482) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  $\n12,846     \n$\n19,195  \n$\n110,038  \n$\n32,705 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate is as follows:\n \n \n  \nSuccessor  \n \n    \nPredecessor\n \n \n  \nJuly 1, 2020\nthrough\nJanuary 31,\n2021\n \n \n   \nFebruary 1,\n2020\nthrough\nJune 30,\n2020\n \n \nYear ended\nJanuary 31,\n2020\n \n \nYear ended\nJanuary 31,\n2019\n \nU.S. statutory rate\n  \n \n21.0%  \n    \n \n21.0%  \n \n21.0%  \n \n21.0% \nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n  \n \n(33.3)  \n    \n \n1.5 \n \n \n1.7 \n \n \n2.2 \nNet changes in deferred tax valuation allowances\n  \n \n41.5 \n \n    \n \n0.6 \n \n \n1.4 \n \n \n(0.9) \nTax on foreign earnings different than U.S. rate\n  \n \n(56.0)  \n    \n \n(20.9)  \n \n1.2 \n \n \n(0.6) \nImpact of Avnet settlement agreement\n  \n \n\u2014 \n \n    \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n(4.0) \nNondeductible indemnities\n  \n \n\u2014 \n \n    \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n0.1 \n \n \n0.8 \nNondeductible goodwill\n  \n \n\u2014 \n \n    \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n2.9 \nReversal of previously accrued income tax reserves\n  \n \n(4.4)  \n    \n \n(1.9)  \n \n(0.9)  \n \n(2.0) \nInterest not subject to tax, net\n  \n \n13.5 \n \n    \n \n(4.0)  \n \n(0.9)  \n \n(0.6) \nEffect of company-owned life insurance\n  \n \n40.9 \n \n    \n \n0.9 \n \n \n(0.3)  \n \n0.1 \nGlobal Intangible Low-Taxed Income\n  \n \n(0.8)  \n    \n \n13.1 \n \n \n0.1 \n \n \n1.0 \nU.S. Tax Reform transition tax\n  \n \n\u2014 \n \n    \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n(13.2) \nNon-taxable gain on bargain purchase\n  \n \n(26.8)  \n    \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \nNondeductible transaction costs\n  \n \n38.3 \n \n    \n \n10.9 \n \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \nNondeductible accrued loss contingency\n  \n \n(1.1)  \n    \n \n39.4 \n \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \nNet operating loss carryback rate differential\n  \n \n(41.9)  \n    \n \n(4.4)  \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \nChanges in deferred tax rates\n  \n \n50.6 \n \n    \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \nForeign withholding taxes\n  \n \n29.3 \n \n    \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \nExcess stock deductions\n  \n \n\u2014 \n \n    \n \n(6.5)  \n \n\u2014 \n \n \n\u2014 \nOther, net\n  \n \n(4.5)  \n    \n \n7.7 \n \n \n(0.7)  \n \n2.1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n66.3 % \n     \n57.4 % \n \n22.7 % \n \n8.8 % \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n183\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d) which significantly revised U.S. corporate\nincome tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a modified territorial tax\nsystem that included a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for\nU.S. Tax Reform, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) 118 which required that the Company include in its financial statements the\nreasonable estimate of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate had been determined. SAB 118 allowed the\nCompany to report provisional amounts within a measurement period up to one year due to the complexities inherent in adopting the changes.\nAccordingly, in fiscal 2018, the Company recorded its provisional estimate of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform. During fiscal 2019, the\nCompany finalized its analysis of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform and decreased its estimate of the one-time transition tax by $49.2 million,\nprimarily due to further analysis of earnings and profits of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and the utilization of foreign tax credits.\nAdditionally, U.S. Tax Reform subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company has made the accounting policy election to treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense.\nThe components of pretax income are as follows (in thousands):\n \n \n  \nSuccessor       \nPredecessor\n \n \n  \nJuly 1,\n2020\nthrough\nJanuary 31,\n2021\n     \nFebruary 1,\n2020\nthrough\nJune 30,\n2020\n   \nYear ended\nJanuary 31,\n2020\n   \nYear ended\nJanuary 31,\n2019\n \nU.S.\n  $\n(160,423)      \n$\n12,606   $\n198,908   $\n208,643 \nForeign\n   \n179,787      \n \n20,835    \n285,630    \n164,642 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n$19,364      \n$33,441   \n$484,538   \n$373,285 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe significant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows (in thousands):\n \n \n  \nSuccessor    \nPredecessor \n \n  \nJanuary 31,\n2021\n   \nJanuary 31,\n2020\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\n  \n  \nDepreciation and amortization\n  \n$\n572,543   \n$\n102,825 \nCapitalized marketing program costs\n  \n \n4,484   \n \n7,564 \nGoodwill\n  \n \n7,937   \n \n34,233 \nDeferred costs currently deductible\n  \n \n16,616   \n \n7,099 \nLease right-of-use assets\n  \n \n91,060   \n \n49,205 \nOther, net\n  \n \n12,206   \n \n16,204 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n  \n \n704,846   \n \n217,130 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDeferred tax assets:\n  \n  \nAccrued liabilities\n  \n \n42,216   \n \n56,234 \nForeign tax credit carryforwards\n  \n \n51,155   \n \n51,140 \nLoss carryforwards\n  \n \n107,531   \n \n111,078 \nAmortizable goodwill\n  \n \n\u2014   \n \n11,092 \nDepreciation and amortization\n  \n \n5,617   \n \n11,700 \nLease liabilities\n  \n \n92,744   \n \n49,205 \nDisallowed interest expense\n  \n \n24,237   \n \n15,755 \nAcquisition and transaction related costs\n  \n \n13,087   \n \n4,026 \nOther, net\n  \n \n3,515   \n \n17,786 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n184\nTable of Contents\n \n  \nSuccessor   \nPredecessor \n \n  \nJanuary 31,\n2021\n  \nJanuary 31,\n2020\n \n   \n340,102  \n \n328,016 \nLess: valuation allowances\n   \n(130,584)  \n \n(123,709) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal deferred tax assets\n   \n209,518  \n \n204,307 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet deferred tax liability\n  $\n(495,328)  \n$\n(12,823) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe increase in the Company\u2019s overall deferred tax liability position is primarily due to the increase in the Company\u2019s identified intangible assets recorded\nas a result of the Merger (see Note 4 \u2013 Acquisitions for further discussion). As of January 31, 2021, there are no outside basis differences in foreign\nsubsidiaries which would require any material deferred taxes to be recorded.\nIn fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded income tax expense of $8.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively, related to changes in deferred tax\nvaluation allowances. The net change in the deferred tax valuation allowances in fiscal 2021 was an increase of $6.9 million primarily resulting from an\nincrease in certain foreign jurisdictions. The net change in the deferred tax valuation allowances in fiscal 2020 was an increase of $5.2 million primarily\nresulting from an increase in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nThe valuation allowances at both January 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily relate to carryforwards for foreign net operating losses and foreign tax credits in the\nUnited States. The Company\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards totaled $495.9 million and $489.4 million at January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The\nmajority of the net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period with the remaining portion expiring in fiscal years 2022 through 2038. The\nCompany\u2019s foreign tax credit carryforwards in the U.S. totaled $51.2 million and $51.1 million at January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The foreign tax\ncredits have a ten year carryforward period, and the majority are set to expire in fiscal year 2028. The Company considers all positive and negative\nevidence available in determining the potential of realizing deferred tax assets. To the extent that the Company generates consistent taxable income within\nthose operations with valuation allowances, the Company may reduce the valuation allowances, thereby reducing income tax expense and increasing net\nincome in the period the determination is made.\nThe estimates and assumptions used by the Company in computing the income taxes reflected in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements could\ndiffer from the actual results reflected in the income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments are recorded based on filed returns when\nsuch returns are finalized or the related adjustments are identified.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued interest and penalties,\nfor the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019\nis as follows (in thousands):\n \n \n \nSuccessor\n  \n   \nPredecessor\n \n \nJuly 1, 2020\nthrough\nJanuary 31,2021  \n   \nFebruary 1, 2020\nthrough\nJune 30, 2020   \nYear ended\nJanuary 31,\n2020\n  \nYear ended\nJanuary 31,\n2019\n \nGross unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of period\n \n$\n20,022  \n   \n$\n20,881  \n$\n25,837  \n$\n72,252 \nIncreases in tax positions for prior years\n \n \n\u2014    \n   \n \n3  \n \n766  \n \n4,671 \nDecreases in tax positions for prior years\n \n \n(335)  \n   \n \n\u2014    \n \n(3,237)  \n \n(13,787) \nIncreases in tax positions for current year\n \n \n\u2014    \n   \n \n\u2014    \n \n55  \n \n\u2014   \nExpiration of statutes of limitation\n \n \n(1,442)  \n   \n \n\u2014    \n \n(1,432)  \n \n(25,840) \nSettlements\n \n \n\u2014    \n  \n \n(638)  \n \n(849)  \n \n(5,355) \n \n185\nTable of Contents\n \n \nSuccessor\n  \n   \nPredecessor\n \n \nJuly 1, 2020\nthrough\nJanuary 31,2021  \n   \nFebruary 1, 2020\nthrough\nJune 30, 2020   \nYear ended\nJanuary 31,\n2020\n  \nYear ended\nJanuary 31,\n2019\n \nChanges due to translation of foreign currencies\n \n \n829  \n   \n \n(224)  \n \n(259)  \n \n(6,104) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGross unrecognized tax benefits at end of period\n \n$\n19,074  \n  \n$\n20,022  \n$\n20,881  \n$\n25,837 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $16.2 million,\n$18.3 million and $23.1 million, respectively. In connection with the acquisition of TS, pursuant to the interest purchase agreement, the Company and\nAvnet agreed to indemnify each other in relation to certain tax matters. As a result, the Company has recorded certain indemnification assets for expected\namounts to be received from Avnet related to liabilities recorded for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company has also recorded certain indemnification\nliabilities for expected amounts to be paid to Avnet. During the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020\nand 2019, due to the resolution of certain pre-acquisition tax matters and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation, the Company recorded benefits in\nincome tax expense of $0.6 million, $1.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively. As a result, the Company recorded expenses of $0.6 million, $1.2 million and\n$9.6 million, during the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are\nincluded in \u201cselling, general and administrative expenses\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, related to changes in the corresponding\nindemnification assets and liabilities recorded. The net impact of these items had no impact on the Company\u2019s net income.\nUnrecognized tax benefits that have a reasonable possibility of significantly decreasing within the 12 months following January 31, 2021 totaled\n$2.3 million, all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized, primarily related to the foreign taxation of certain transactions. Consistent with\nprior periods, the Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The Company\u2019s\naccrued interest at January 31, 2021, would not have a material impact on the effective tax rate if reversed. The provision for income taxes for the period\nfrom July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019\nincludes interest expense on unrecognized income tax benefits for current and prior years which is not significant to the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. The change in the balance of accrued interest for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, includes the current year end accrual, an interest\nbenefit resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitation, and the translation adjustments on foreign currencies.\nThe Company conducts business primarily in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific, and as a result, one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax\nreturns in the U.S. federal, various state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by\ntaxing authorities. The Company is no longer subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service for years before fiscal 2018, except for the fiscal\n2021 net operating loss to be carried back to fiscal 2016. Income tax returns of various foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2006 and forward are currently under\ntaxing authority examination or remain subject to audit.\n \n186\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 9 \u2014 Employee Benefit Plans\nEquity Awards in the Parent\nSubsequent to the Merger, certain of the Company\u2019s employees have been granted equity awards (\u201cSeries B Units\u201d) in the Parent. Series B Units entitle\nthe holder to certain rights to receive amounts in cash upon a Substantially All Assets Sale Distribution or a Liquidation Event Distribution, each as\ndefined in the Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P. Partnership Agreement. A total of 90,000 Series B Units are available for grant. Series B Units with service\nconditions only (\u201cTime-based Series B Units\u201d) vest over a five-year period from the date of grant. Series B Units with service, market and performance\nconditions (\u201cPerformance-based Series B Units\u201d) vest if the total cash return to certain affiliates of Apollo (referred to as \u201cMOIC\u201d) upon a liquidation\nevent exceeds certain defined thresholds while the holder of the Performance-based Series B Units is employed with the Company. Certain non-employee\nmembers of the Board of Directors of the Company have also been granted preferred shares (\u201cSeries A Units\u201d) and common shares in the Parent that vest\nover a one-year period from the date of grant.\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $3.0 million for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 for the Time-based Series B\nUnits. No expense was recorded for the Performance-based Series B Units as it is not considered probable that the performance conditions will be\nsatisfied. An immaterial amount of stock-based compensation expense was recorded for both the Series A Units and the common shares for the period\nfrom July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.\nA summary of the Time-based Series B Units activity for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 is as follows:\n \n \n  \nShares\n  \nWeighted- average\ngrant date fair value \nSuccessor:\n  \n \nGranted\n  \n \n25,096  \n$\n1,067.40 \nCanceled\n  \n \n(120)  \n \n              1,067.40 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNonvested at January 31, 2021\n  \n         24,976  \n \n1,067.40 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs of January 31, 2021, the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested Time-based Series B Units was $23.7 million, which the\nCompany expects to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 4.4 years.\nA summary of the Performance-based Series B Units activity, assuming maximum achievement for nonvested awards, for the fiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 is as follows:\n \n \n  \nShares\n  \nWeighted- average\ngrant date fair value \nSuccessor:\n  \n \nGranted\n  \n \n50,192  \n$\n656.47 \nCanceled\n  \n \n(240)  \n \n                  656.47 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNonvested at January 31, 2021\n  \n         49,952  \n \n656.47 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs of January 31, 2021, the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested Performance-based Series B Units, assuming maximum\nachievement, was $32.8 million.\nThe Company estimated the value of the Time-based Series B Units and Performance-based Series B Units at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation framework, where the total equity value of the Parent was solved such that the aggregate value of the Series A Units and common shares\nequaled the initial capital contribution in the Parent. The equity value of the Parent was assessed using the Monte Carlo simulation framework over a\nperiod from the grant date to an expected Substantially All Assets Sale Distribution or a Liquidation Event Distribution. The Company estimated the\nvolatility applicable to the equity value of the Parent based on the\n \n187\nTable of Contents\nobserved equity volatility for similar companies while considering the effects of differences in capital structures. In each simulation path, the Company\ncalculated the MOIC on a fully diluted basis at the liquidity event. The Company used a risk-free interest rate to discount the value of the Series B Units\nand applied an estimated discount for lack of marketability to conclude on the fair value of the Series B Units.\nThe following table describes the key assumptions used in applying the Monte Carlo valuation methodology to estimate the grant date fair value of Time-\nbased Series B Units and Performance-based Series B Units:\n \nExpected term\n  \nExpected equity volatility\n \nRisk-\nfree interest rate \nExpected dividend yield\n \nDiscount for lack of marketability\n5.0 years\n  \n39%\n \n0.29%\n \n0.0%\n \n20%\nAdditionally, holders of Series B Units are entitled to periodic cash payments based on a predefined percentage of distributions made from the Parent.\nAmounts are payable in cash six months after the date of the distribution by the Parent provided the holder of Series B Units remains employed with the\nCompany. Cash payments received by the holders of Series B Units reduce the amount the holder is entitled to receive in cash upon a Substantially All\nAssets Sale Distribution or a Liquidation Event Distribution. The Company recorded expenses of $6.5 million in \u201cselling, general and administrative\nexpenses\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 related to cash payments due to the\nholders of Series B Units.\nEquity Incentive Plans\nThe 2018 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders in June 2018 and included 2.0 million shares available for grant. During the\npredecessor period, the Company awarded officers, employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors restricted stock, options to\npurchase common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance awards that were dependent upon achievement of specified performance goals.\nEquity-based compensation awards were used by the Company to attract talent and as a retention mechanism for the award recipients and had a maximum\nterm of ten years, unless a shorter period was specified by the Compensation Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cCompensation\nCommittee\u201d) or was required under local law. Awards under the plan were priced as determined by the Compensation Committee and were required to be\npriced at, or above, the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. Awards generally vested between one year and three\nyears from the date of grant. The Company\u2019s policy was to utilize shares of its treasury stock, to the extent available, to satisfy its obligation to issue\nshares upon the exercise of awards.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon closing of the Merger all nonvested RSU\u2019s were vested, cancelled and converted into the right to\nreceive an amount of $145 per share in cash. Nonvested PRSU\u2019s were also cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount of $145 per share\nin cash determined as follows: (i) for PRSU\u2019s granted during fiscal 2019, the number of shares equaled 130% of the target shares granted and (ii) for\nPRSU\u2019s granted during fiscal 2020, the number of shares equaled 110% of the target shares granted. The Company recognized $20.4 million of stock-based\ncompensation expense within \u201cacquisition, integration and restructuring expenses\u201d during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, related to the\nacceleration of the vesting of nonvested RSU and PRSU awards.\nFor the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and\n2019, the Company recorded $20.4 million, $9.2 million, $32.2 million and $31.5 million, respectively, of total stock-based compensation expense related to\nawards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, and related income tax benefits of $6.3 million, $2.0 million, $7.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively. The\nactual benefit received from the tax deduction from the exercise of equity-based incentives was $6.3 million, $10.6 million, $7.0 million and $5.4 million for\nthe period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n \n188\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock\nPrior to the Merger, the Company\u2019s restricted stock awards were primarily in the form of RSUs and typically vested in annual installments lasting between\none year and three years from the date of grant, unless a different vesting schedule was mandated by country law. All of the RSUs had a fair market value\nequal to the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense included $10.7 million, $6.4 million,\n$23.4 million and $25.4 million related to RSUs during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020\nand the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nA summary of the Company\u2019s RSU activity for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 is as follows:\n \n \n  \nShares\n  \nWeighted- average\ngrant date fair value \nPredecessor:\n  \n \nNonvested at January 31, 2020\n  \n \n574,980  \n$\n91.84 \nVested\n  \n \n(266,024)  \n \n                    92.85 \nCanceled\n  \n \n(3,443)  \n \n96.00 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNonvested at June 30, 2020\n  \n         305,513  \n \n90.91 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuccessor:\n  \n \nVested, cancelled and converted per Merger Agreement\n  \n \n(305,513)  \n$\n90.91 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNonvested at January 31, 2021\n  \n \n\u2014    \n \n\u2014   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe total fair value of RSUs which vested during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2020 and 2019 is $27.8 million, $24.7 million, $22.9 million and $21.1 million, respectively.\nThere were no RSUs granted during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 or the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020.

The weighted-average fair\nvalue of the 153,719 PRSUs granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 was $82.13 per share.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d), the Company was authorized to issue up to 1.0 million shares of common stock to eligible\nemployees in the Company\u2019s U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees could choose to have a fixed dollar amount or\npercentage deducted from their bi-weekly compensation to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock and/or elect to purchase shares once per calendar\nquarter. The purchase price of the stock was 85% of the market value on the purchase date and employees were limited to a maximum purchase of $25,000\nin fair market value each calendar year. Subject to the Merger Agreement, the ESPP was suspended in November 2019. From the inception through\nsuspension of the program, the Company issued 575,174 shares of common stock to the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP\nwas insignificant during fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nRetirement Savings Plan\nThe Company sponsors the Tech Data Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan (the \u201c401(k) Savings Plan\u201d) for its U.S. employees. At the Company\u2019s discretion,\nparticipant deferrals are matched in cash, in an amount equal to 50% of the first 6% of participant deferrals and participants are fully vested following four\nyears of qualified service. Aggregate contributions made by the Company to the 401(k) Savings Plan were $4.4 million, $3.3 million, $7.1 million and\n$6.7 million for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\n \n190\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 10 \u2014 Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company\u2019s assets and liabilities carried or disclosed at fair value are classified in one of the following three categories: Level 1 \u2013 quoted market\nprices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\u037e Level 2 \u2013 inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 above that are observable\nfor the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly\u037e and, Level 3 \u2013 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Company\u2019s interest rate swaps are measured on a recurring basis using a\ndiscounted cash flow valuation technique considering the terms of the instrument, discount rates and projected LIBOR rates (see Note 11 \u2013 Derivative\nInstruments for further discussion).\nPrior to the Merger, the Company utilized life insurance policies to fund the Company\u2019s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The life insurance\nasset, which was recorded in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet in \u201cother assets, net\u201d, was the amount that would be realized upon the assumed\nsurrender of the policy. This amount was based on the underlying fair value of the invested assets contained within the life insurance policies. The gains\nand losses were recorded in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations within \u201cother expense, net.\u201d The related deferred compensation\nliability, which was recorded in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet in \u201caccrued expenses and other liabilities,\u201d was marked-to-market each period\nbased upon the returns of the various investments selected by the plan participants and the gains and losses were recorded in the Company\u2019s\nConsolidated Statement of Operations within \u201cselling, general and administrative expenses.\u201d\n \n191\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of the change in control related to the Merger, participant balances in the Company\u2019s nonqualified deferred compensation plan were frozen as\nof June 30, 2020. The deferred compensation liability balance was paid in full to participants and the related investments were liquidated during the period\nfrom July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. The net realizable value of the Company\u2019s life insurance investments and related deferred compensation liability was\n$41.1 million and $41.0 million, respectively, at January 31, 2020.\nThe estimated fair value of the Senior Notes is based upon quoted market information (Level 1). The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes was\napproximately $199.0 million and $1.04 billion, respectively, at January 31, 2021 and 2020 and the carrying value was $198.7 million and $994.3 million,\nrespectively, at January 31, 2021 and 2020. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value\nbecause of the short maturity of these items. The carrying amounts of debt outstanding pursuant to revolving credit facilities and term loans\napproximated fair value as the majority of these instruments have variable interest rates which approximate current market rates (Level 2 criteria).\n \n192\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 11 \u2014 Derivative Instruments\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company\u2019s foreign currency risk\nmanagement objective has been to protect earnings and cash flows from the impact of exchange rate changes primarily through the use of foreign\ncurrency forward contracts and a cross-currency swap.\nNet Investment Hedges\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in euro denominated foreign\noperations which were designated as net investment hedges. The Company entered into the net investment hedges to offset the risk of change in the\nU.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s investment in a euro functional subsidiary due to fluctuating foreign exchange rates. The Company terminated these\nnet investment hedge contracts during the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 resulting in cash proceeds of $53.4 million.\nThe following tables present the effects of the Company\u2019s net investment hedges on accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and earnings\nfor the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the year ended January 31, 2021:\n \n \n \nPredecessor\n  \n \n \n \nFebruary 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020\n  \n \nDerivatives designated as net\ninvestment hedges:\n \nAmount of gain (loss)\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income\n(loss)\n  \nAmount of gain (loss)\nreclassified from\nAOCI into income   \nAmount of gain (loss)\nrecognized in income (amount\nexcluded from effectiveness\ntesting)\n  \nLocation of gain (loss)\nrecognized in income (amount\nexcluded from effectiveness\ntesting)\n(in thousands)\n \n \n \n \nForeign currency forward contracts\n \n$\n                24,934  \n$\n                    \u2014  \n$\n                            3,316  \nInterest expense\n \n \nPredecessor\n  \n \n \n \nYear ended January 31, 2020\n  \n \nDerivatives designated as net\ninvestment hedges:\n \nAmount of gain (loss)\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income\n(loss)\n  \nAmount of gain (loss)\nreclassified from\nAOCI into income   \nAmount of gain (loss)\nrecognized in income (amount\nexcluded from effectiveness\ntesting)\n  \nLocation of gain (loss)\nrecognized in income (amount\nexcluded from effectiveness\ntesting)\n(in thousands)\n \n \n \n \nForeign currency forward contracts\n \n$\n15,508  \n$\n\u2014  \n$\n10,237  \nInterest expense\nThe Company had no net investment hedges outstanding during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 or the fiscal year ended January 31,\n2019.\nCash Flow Hedges\nPrior to the Merger, Merger Sub entered into two interest rate swaps in order to hedge the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on expected borrowings\nunder the ABL in conjunction with the closing of the Merger. These interest rate swaps convert the interest payable on the ABL Term Loans from a\nvariable rate to a fixed rate. The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as of the Merger date. The notional values of the interest rate\nswaps totaled $2.0 billion at January 31, 2021 and they are set to mature on August 29, 2025. Additionally, the Company previously entered into a cross-\ncurrency swap to hedge its cash flows related to certain foreign-currency denominated debt which was designated as a cash flow hedge. The notional\nvalue of this swap was $4.5 million at January 31, 2020 and the swap matured in February 2020.\n \n193\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the effects of the Company\u2019s cash flow hedges on AOCI and earnings for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021,\nthe period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020:\n \n \n \nSuccessor\n  \n \n \n \n \nJuly 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021\n  \n \n \nDerivatives designated as cash flow\nhedges:\n \nAmount of gain (loss)\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income\n(loss)\n  \nAmount of gain (loss)\nreclassified from AOCI\ninto income (loss)\n  \nAmount of gain (loss)\nrecognized in income (amount\nexcluded from effectiveness\ntesting)\n  \nLocation of gain (loss)\nreclassified from\nAOCI into income\n(loss)\n \n(in thousands)\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nInterest rate swaps\n \n$\n                11,429  \n$\n                (72)  \n$\n                            \u2014  \n Interest expense\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal\n \n$\n11,429  \n$\n(72)  \n$\n\u2014  \n \n \nPredecessor\n  \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020\n  \n \n \nDerivatives designated as cash flow\nhedges:\n \nAmount of gain (loss)\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income\n(loss)\n  \nAmount of gain (loss)\nreclassified from AOCI\ninto income (loss)\n  \nAmount of gain (loss)\nrecognized in income (amount\nexcluded from effectiveness\ntesting)\n  \nLocation of gain (loss)\nreclassified from\nAOCI into income\n(loss)\n \n(in thousands)\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nCross-currency swap\n \n$\n402  \n$\n(90)  \n$\n\u2014  \n Interest expense\n \n \n \n \n507  \n \n\u2014  \n Other expense, net  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal\n \n$\n402  \n$\n417  \n$\n\u2014  \n \n \nPredecessor\n  \n \n \n \n \nYear ended January 31, 2020\n  \n \n \nDerivatives designated as cash flow\nhedges:\n \nAmount of gain (loss)\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income\n(loss)\n  \nAmount of gain (loss)\nreclassified from AOCI\ninto income (loss)\n  \nAmount of gain (loss)\nrecognized in income (amount\nexcluded from effectiveness\ntesting)\n  \nLocation of gain (loss)\nreclassified from\nAOCI into income\n(loss)\n \n(in thousands)\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nCross-currency swap\n \n$\n126  \n$\n618  \n$\n\u2014  \n Interest expense\n \n \n \n \n(507)  \n \n\u2014  \n Other expense, net  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal\n \n$\n126  \n$\n111  \n$\n\u2014  \nThe Company had no cash flow hedges outstanding during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedges\nThe Company additionally utilizes forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge intercompany loans, accounts receivable\nand accounts payable. The Company\u2019s foreign currency exposure relates primarily to international transactions where the currency collected from\ncustomers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product. The Company\u2019s transactions in its foreign operations are denominated\nprimarily in the following currencies: Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Czech koruna, Danish krone, euro, Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah,\nMexican peso, Norwegian krone, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and U.S. dollar.\nThe Company considers inventory as an economic hedge against foreign currency exposure in accounts payable in certain circumstances. This practice\noffsets such inventory against corresponding accounts payable denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary buying\nthe inventory, when determining the net exposure to be hedged using traditional forward contracts. Under this strategy, the Company would expect to\nincrease or decrease selling prices for products purchased in foreign currencies based on fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affecting the\nunderlying accounts payable. To the extent the\n \n194\nTable of Contents\nCompany incurs a foreign currency exchange loss (gain) on the underlying accounts payable denominated in the foreign currency, a corresponding\nincrease (decrease) in gross profit would be expected as the related inventory is sold. This strategy can result in a certain degree of quarterly earnings\nvolatility as the underlying accounts payable is remeasured using the foreign currency exchange rate prevailing at the end of each period, or settlement\ndate if earlier, whereas the corresponding increase (decrease) in gross profit is not realized until the related inventory is sold.\nThe total amount of gains (losses) recognized in earnings on the Company\u2019s derivatives not designated as hedges for the period from July 1, 2020 to\nJanuary 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n \n \n \n \n \nGains (losses) recognized in earnings\n \n \n \n \n \nSuccessor\n  \nPredecessor\n \nDerivatives not designated as\nhedges\n \nStatement of\nOperations location\n \nJuly 1, 2020 through\nJanuary 31, 2021\n  \nFebruary 1, 2020\nthrough June 30,\n2020\n  \nYear ended\nJanuary 31, 2020  \nYear ended\nJanuary 31, 2019 \n(in millions)\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nForeign currency forward\ncontracts\n \nCost of products sold\n \n$\n(10.7)  \n$\n2.6  \n$\n(3.0)  \n$\n17.7 \nForeign currency forward\ncontracts\n \nOther expense, net\n \n \n            (2.4)  \n \n                (16.6)  \n \n            (5.3)  \n \n            (44.8) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal\n \n \n$\n(13.1)  \n$\n(14.0)  \n$\n(8.3)  \n$\n(27.1) \nThe gains and losses on the Company\u2019s foreign currency forward contracts are largely offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying hedged\nassets or liabilities. The Company\u2019s average notional amounts of derivatives not designated as hedges outstanding during the period from July 1, 2020 to\nJanuary 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, were approximately $0.9 billion,\n$1.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, with average maturities of 26 days, 22 days, 25 days and 25 days, respectively. Under the Company\u2019s\nhedging policies, gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments would be expected to continue to be largely offset by the gains and losses on\nthe underlying assets or liabilities being hedged.\nThe Company\u2019s derivatives are also discussed in Note 10 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements.\n \n195\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 12 \u2014 Shareholders\u2019 Equity\nIn October 2018, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $200.0 million of the Company\u2019s common stock. In\nFebruary 2019, the Board of Directors approved a $100.0 million increase to the program. In August 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized\nthe repurchase of up to an additional $200.0 million of the Company\u2019s common stock, resulting in a total share repurchase authorization of $500.0 million.\nIn conjunction with the Company\u2019s share repurchase program, a 10b5-1 plan was executed that instructed the broker selected by the Company to\nrepurchase shares on behalf of the Company. The amount of common stock repurchased in accordance with the 10b5-1 plan on any given trading day\nwas determined by a formula in the plan, which was based on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. Shares repurchased by the Company\nwere held in treasury for general corporate purposes, including issuances under equity incentive and benefit plans. The reissuance of shares from\ntreasury stock was based on the weighted average purchase price of the shares.\nThe Company\u2019s common share repurchase and issuance activity for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 is summarized as follows:\n \n \n  \nShares\n  \nWeighted-\naverage\nprice per\nshare\n \nTreasury stock balance at January 31, 2019 (predecessor)\n   22,305,464  \n$\n46.53 \nShares of common stock repurchased under share repurchase program\n   \n1,723,081  \n \n98.77 \nShares of treasury stock reissued for equity incentive plans\n   \n(209,315)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTreasury stock balance at January 31, 2020 (predecessor)\n   23,819,230  \n \n50.30 \nShares of treasury stock reissued for equity incentive plans\n   \n(260,301)  \nElimination of treasury stock shares upon Merger\n   (23,558,929)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTreasury stock balance at January 31, 2021 (successor)\n   \n\u2014    \n$\n\u2014   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring the year ended January 31, 2020, the Company repurchased $170.2 million of its common stock.

The Company has operating leases for certain logistics centers, office facilities, vehicles and equipment. The Company\u2019s finance leases\nare not material. Short-term operating leases, which have an initial term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on the balance sheet. Certain of the\nCompany\u2019s operating leases contain options to extend the lease, which are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be\nexercised. Certain of the Company\u2019s operating leases contain options to terminate the lease\u037e periods after the date of the termination option are included\nin the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will not exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company has elected to not\nseparately recognize the lease and non-lease components of a contract for all operating leases.\nOperating leases are included in \u201cother assets, net\u201d, \u201caccrued expenses and other liabilities\u201d (for the current portion of lease liabilities) and \u201cother long-\nterm liabilities\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present\nvalue of remaining lease payments over the lease term using the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recognized in \u201cselling, general and administrative expenses\u201d on the Consolidated Statement of\nOperations. Variable lease costs are recognized as incurred.\nThe following table presents the contractual maturities of the Company\u2019s operating lease liabilities as of January 31, 2021:\n \nFiscal Year:\n \n \n(in thousands)\n  \n \n \n2022\n  $\n88,778 \n2023\n   \n75,995 \n2024\n   \n50,482 \n2025\n   \n38,134 \n2026\n   \n34,155 \nThereafter\n   200,685 \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal payments\n  $ 488,229 \nLess amount of lease payments representing interest\n   (84,326) \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal present value of lease payments\n  $ 403,903 \n \n \n \n \n \nRental expense for all operating leases totaled $54.0 million, $35.9 million, $86.0 million and $87.2 million during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31,\n2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The Brazilian subsidiary has appealed the unfavorable ruling to the Supreme Court and Superior Court, Brazil\u2019s two highest appellate\ncourts. Based on the legal opinion of outside counsel, the Company believes that the chances of success on appeal of this matter are favorable and the\nBrazilian subsidiary intends to vigorously defend its position that the CIDE tax is not due. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded an accrual for the\ntotal estimated CIDE tax exposure. However, due to the lack of predictability of the Brazilian court system, the Company has concluded that it is\nreasonably possible that the Brazilian subsidiary may incur a loss up to the total exposure described above. The Company believes the resolution of this\nlitigation will not be material to the Company\u2019s consolidated net assets or liquidity.\nThe French Autorit\u00e9 de la Concurrence (\u201cCompetition Authority\u201d) began in 2013 an investigation into the French market for certain products of Apple\nInc., for which the Company is a distributor. In March 2020, the Competition Authority imposed fines on the Company, on another distributor, and on\nApple, finding that the Company entered into an anticompetitive agreement with Apple regarding volume allocations of Apple products. The fine\nimposed on the Company was \u20ac76 million. The Company has vigorously contested the arguments of the Competition Authority, and the Company has\nappealed its determination to the French courts, seeking to set aside or reduce the fine. Although the Company believes it has strong arguments on\nappeal, the Company determined during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 that the best estimate of probable loss related to this matter is \u20ac36 million. As a\nresult, during the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, the Company recorded a charge of $41.2 million in \u201clegal settlements and other litigation,\nnet\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Under French law, the pendency of the Company\u2019s appeal does not suspend the obligation to pay the\nfine. The Company has agreed to make eight equal installment payments in relation to the fine assessed for a total amount of \u20ac22.8 million on a quarterly\nbasis from January 2021 through October 2022, the first payment of which was made during fiscal 2021. If the appeal process is not completed prior to the\nend of December 2022, the Company may be required to pay further amounts towards the full fine assessed by the Competition Authority before the\nCompany\u2019s appeal is finally determined. However, any additional amounts that may need to be paid have not yet been determined. Additionally, the\nCompany has provided a third-party surety bond to the Competition Authority to guarantee the payment of the amount of the fine and interest, if\napplicable.\nThe Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company\u2019s management does not\nexpect that the outcome in any of these other legal proceedings, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nGuarantees\nAs is customary in the technology industry, to encourage certain customers to purchase products, the Company has arrangements with certain finance\ncompanies that provide inventory financing facilities to the Company\u2019s customers. In conjunction with certain of these arrangements, the Company\nwould be required to purchase certain inventory in the event the inventory is repossessed from the customers by the finance companies. As the\nCompany does not have access to information regarding the amount of inventory purchased from the Company still on hand with the customer at any\npoint in time, the Company\u2019s repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated. Repurchases of inventory by the Company\nunder these arrangements have been insignificant to date. The Company believes that, based on historical experience, the likelihood of a material loss\npursuant to these inventory repurchase obligations is remote.\n \n200\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 15 \u2014 Subsequent Events\nOn March 22, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cSYNNEX Merger Agreement\u201d) with SYNNEX Corporation\n(\u201cSYNNEX\u201d) and its affiliates. Pursuant to the SYNNEX Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions described therein, the\naffiliates of SYNNEX will acquire all the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201cSYNNEX Merger\u201d).\nAt the effective time of the SYNNEX Merger, except as otherwise set forth in the SYNNEX Merger Agreement, all the issued and outstanding common\nshares of the Company will be converted automatically into and thereafter represent only the right to receive (i)\n$1,610,000,000 in cash, in the aggregate and (ii) 44,000,000 total shares of common stock of SYNNEX. Prior to the effective date of the SYNNEX Merger,\naffiliates of Apollo are required to make an additional equity contribution of at least $500 million in cash to the Company. The completion of the SYNNEX\nMerger is also subject to customary closing conditions, including the adoption of the SYNNEX Merger Agreement by a majority of the holders of the\noutstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock, the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust\nImprovements Act, certain foreign regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\n \n201\nTable of Contents\nAnnex A",

A Registration Request which does not result in an effective registration under the\nSecurities Act or a Registration Request that is withdrawn prior to the filing of the requested Registration Statement shall not be counted as a\nRegistration Request for purposes of the limits in the preceding sentence. All Registration Requests made pursuant to this Section 2 will specify the\naggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be registered and will also specify the intended methods of disposition thereof.\n(b)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Corporation\u2019s receipt of information from the Apollo Stockholders that is required by\napplicable law to be included in such Shelf Registration regarding such Apollo Stockholders, within two Business Days after the Closing Date, the\nCorporation shall file an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3ASR covering resales of the Registrable Securities by the Apollo\nStockholders, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement effective for a period of 3 years following the Closing\nDate. In addition, (i) at any time that the Corporation is qualified for the use of Form S-3 promulgated under the Securities Act or any successor form\nthereto, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to request in writing registration under the Securities Act of all or any portion of the Registrable\nSecurities beneficially owned by any member of the Apollo Stockholders group on Form S-3 (or any successor form) or any similar short form registration\nstatement, if available (a \u201cShort-Form Registration\u201d) and (ii) at any time, and from time to time, that the initial registration statement on Form S-3ASR or\nother shelf registration statements is not in effect or will expire within 90 days, the Apollo Stockholders may request in writing a shelf offering on a\ndelayed or continuous basis in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act (including the registration statement referred to in the immediately\nprecedent sentence, a \u201cShelf Registration\u201d), in which case the provisions of this Section 2(b) shall be applicable, provided that the Apollo Stockholders\nmay only make two Registration Requests, written requests for Short Form Registration, or written requests for Shelf Registration, in the aggregate, in any\nrolling twelve month period. All written requests for Short Form Registration shall (i) specify the aggregate number of Registrable Securities intended to\nbe sold or disposed of, (ii) state the intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities and (iii) whether or not such Short Form Registration\nshall be a Shelf Registration, and upon receipt of such request, the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to effect the\nregistration under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities so requested to be registered. Any Apollo Stockholder whose Registrable Securities are\nincluded in an effective Shelf Registration (a \u201cShelf Holder\u201d) may initiate an offering or sale of all or part of such Registrable Securities (a \u201cShelf Take-\nDown\u201d). If the Shelf Holders elect in a written request delivered to the Corporation (an \u201cUnderwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice\u201d), a Shelf Take-Down may\nbe in the form of an Underwritten Offering (an \u201cUnderwritten Shelf Take-Down\u201d) and, if necessary, the Corporation shall file and effect an amendment or\nsupplement to its Shelf Registration for such purpose as soon as practicable. The Shelf Holders shall indicate in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down\nNotice whether they intend for such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to involve a customary \u201croad show\u201d (including an \u201celectronic road show\u201d) or other\nmarketing effort by the underwriters (a \u201cMarketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down\u201d). If the Shelf Holders desire to effect a Shelf Take-Down that does not\nconstitute a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, and that does not involve an Underwritten Offering (a \u201cNon-Marketed Shelf Take-Down\u201d), the\nShelf Holders shall so indicate in a written request delivered to the Corporation no later than two calendar days prior to the expected date of such Non-\nMarketed Shelf Take-Down, which request shall include (i) the total number of Registrable Securities expected to be offered and sold in such Non-\nMarketed Shelf Take-Down, (ii) the expected plan of\n \n-3-\nTable of Contents\ndistribution of such Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down and (iii) the action or actions required (including the timing thereof) in connection with such Non-\nMarketed Shelf Take-Down, and, if necessary, the Corporation shall file and effect an amendment or supplement to its Shelf Registration for such purpose\nas soon as practicable. All determinations as to whether to complete any Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down and as to the timing, manner, price and other\nterms of any Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down shall be at the discretion of the Shelf Holders. The Corporation shall not be required to effect more than\nthree Underwritten Shelf Take Downs in any rolling twelve-month period and shall not be required to effect any Underwritten Shelf Take Down unless the\naggregate gross proceeds expected to be received from the sale of Registrable Securities in such offering is at least $100 million.\n(c)    Subject to the provisions of this Section 2, promptly upon receipt of any such Registration Request, the Corporation will use commercially\nreasonable efforts to effect such registration under the Securities Act within 120 days of such request (subject to any lock-up restrictions) of the\nRegistrable Securities that the Corporation has been so requested to register, including, without limitation, filing post-effective amendments, appropriate\nqualification under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with the applicable regulations promulgated under the\nSecurities Act. At any time prior to the registration, the Apollo Stockholders may revoke a Registration Request by providing a notice to the Corporation\nrevoking such Registration Request.\n(d)    If the Corporation receives a Registration Request and the Corporation furnishes to the Apollo Stockholders a copy of a resolution of the Board\n(certified by the secretary of the Corporation) stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be materially adverse to the Corporation for a\nRegistration Statement (or an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down or a Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down) to be filed or effected on or before the date such filing\nor take-downs would otherwise be required hereunder, the Corporation shall have the right to defer such filing or take-downs for a period of not more\nthan sixty (60) days after the date such filing or take-downs would otherwise be required hereunder (provided that such sixty (60) day period may be\nextended to a period of up to ninety (90) days to the extent such suspension is due to ongoing negotiations or discussions regarding a material merger,\nacquisition or other similar transaction and the requirements for such deferral set forth in this sentence continue to be satisfied. If the Corporation\nfurnishes to the Apollo Stockholders a copy of a resolution of the Board (certified by the secretary of the Corporation) stating that in the good faith\njudgment of the Board it would be materially adverse to the Corporation to continue to permit the use of any prospectus contained any Shelf Registration\nStatement, the Corporation shall be entitled to suspend the use of such prospectus for a reasonable period of time not to exceed (i) sixty (60) days in\nsuccession (provided that such consecutive sixty (60) day period may be extended to a period of up to ninety (90) days in succession to the extent such\nsuspension is due to ongoing negotiations or discussions regarding a material merger, acquisition or other similar transaction and the requirements for\nsuch suspension set forth in this sentence continue to be satisfied (the \u201cExtension Period\u201d)) or (ii) ninety (90) days in the aggregate in any rolling twelve\n(12) month period if the Extension Period has not been triggered or (iii) one hundred twenty (120) days in the aggregate in any rolling twelve month period\nif the Extension Period has been triggered. The Corporation shall not be permitted to take such action in the foregoing sentences more than twice in any\n360-day period (except that the Corporation shall be able to use this right more than twice in any 12-month period if the Corporation is exercising such\nright during the 15-day period prior to the Corporation\u2019s regularly scheduled quarterly earnings announcement date and the total number of days of\npostponement in such 12-month period does not exceed 120 days). If the Corporation shall so postpone the filing of a Registration Statement, the Apollo\nStockholders may withdraw their Registration Request by so advising the Corporation in writing. In addition, if the Corporation receives a Registration\nRequest and the Corporation is then in the process of preparing to register Common Stock in connection with a primary offering, the Corporation shall\ninform the Apollo Stockholders of the Corporation\u2019s intent to engage in a primary offering and may require the Apollo Stockholders to withdraw such\nRegistration Request for a period of up to 90 days so that the Corporation may complete its offering. In the event that the Corporation ceases to pursue\nsuch primary offering, it shall promptly inform the Apollo Stockholders in writing and the Apollo Stockholders shall be permitted to submit a new\nRegistration Request. For the avoidance of doubt, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to participate in the Corporation\u2019s primary offering as\nprovided in Section 3 (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to piggyback on the\nCorporation\u2019s primary offering).\n \n-4-\nTable of Contents\n(e)    Registrations under this Section 2 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the SEC (i) as shall be selected by the Apollo Stockholders and\nas shall be reasonably acceptable to the Corporation and (ii) as shall permit the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended\nmethod or methods of disposition specified in the Registration Request. If, in connection with any registration under this Section 2 that is proposed by\nthe Apollo Stockholders to be on Form S-3 or any successor form, the managing underwriter, if any, shall advise the Apollo Stockholders or the\nCorporation in writing that in its opinion the use of another permitted form is of material importance to the success of the offering, then such registration\nshall be on such other permitted form.\n(f)    The Corporation shall use its best efforts to keep any Registration Statement filed in response to a Registration Request effective for as long as is\nnecessary for the Apollo Stockholders to dispose of all of the covered securities.\n(g)    In the case of an Underwritten Offering that is the subject of a Registration Request, the Apollo Stockholders shall select the underwriter(s)\n(including the roles thereof)\u037e provided that such selection is reasonably acceptable to the Corporation.\n(h)    From and after the date hereof until the termination of the Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain eligibility\nto be able to file and use a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form thereto) and to be a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d within the\nmeaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act.\nSection 3.    Piggyback Registration Right.\n(a)    Participation. Subject to Section 3(b), if the Corporation proposes to file a Registration Statement, whether on its own behalf or in connection with\nthe exercise of any registration rights by any holder of Registrable Securities possessing such rights (other than (i) a registration relating solely to an\nemployee benefit plan or employee stock plan, a dividend reinvestment plan, or a merger or a consolidation, (ii) a registration incidental to an issuance of\ndebt securities under Rule 144A, (iii) a registration on Form S-4 or any successor form or (iv) a registration on Form S-8 or any successor form), with\nrespect to an offering (for its own account or otherwise, and including any registration pursuant to Section 2) that includes any Registrable Securities,\nthen the Corporation shall give prompt notice (the \u201cInitial Notice\u201d) to the Apollo Stockholders, and the Apollo Stockholders shall be entitled to include in\nsuch Registration Statement the Registrable Securities held by them. The Initial Notice shall offer the Apollo Stockholders the right, subject to\nSection 3(b) (the \u201cPiggyback Registration Right\u201d), to register such number of shares of Registrable Securities as each such Apollo Stockholders may\nrequest and shall set forth (A) the anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement and (B) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities that is\nproposed to be included in such Registration Statement.

Each selling Apollo Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted\nby law, the Corporation, its directors, officers, employees and representatives and each Person who controls the Corporation (within the meaning of the\nSecurities Act) against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities and expenses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact\ncontained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or\nnecessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent that such untrue statement or omission was caused by or contained in any\ninformation furnished in writing to the Corporation by such selling Apollo Stockholder expressly for use therein and has not been corrected in a\nsubsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the securities to the Person asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. In no\nevent shall the liability of any selling Apollo Stockholder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such selling\nApollo Stockholder upon the sale of the securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation (except in the event of liability for fraud by such selling\nApollo Stockholder). The Corporation and the selling Apollo Stockholder shall be entitled to receive indemnities from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer\nmanagers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, to the same extent as provided above with respect to information\nso furnished in writing by such Persons specifically for inclusion in any Registration Statement or Prospectus.\n(c)    Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt (but in any event within thirty\n(30) days after such Person has actual knowledge of the facts constituting the basis for indemnification) written notice to the indemnifying party of any\nclaim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably\nsatisfactory to the indemnified party\u037e provided, however, that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party\nof its obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure\u037e provided, further, however, that\nany Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such\nclaim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay\nsuch fees or expenses, (B) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of\nsuch claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person or (C) in the reasonable\njudgment of any such Person, based upon advice of counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party with\nrespect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the\nexpense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person). If such\ndefense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent\n(but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnified party shall not have any obligation to consent to any settlement involving the\nimposition of equitable remedies or involving the imposition of any material obligations on such indemnified party other than financial obligations for\nwhich such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder. No indemnified party will have any obligation to consent to entry of any judgment or enter\ninto any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such\n \n-7-\nTable of Contents\nindemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Whenever the indemnified party or the indemnifying party receives a\nfirm offer to settle a claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder, it shall promptly notify the other of such offer. If the indemnifying party refuses\nto accept such offer within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such offer (or of notice thereof), such claim shall continue to be contested and, if\nsuch claim is within the scope of the indemnifying party\u2019s indemnity contained herein, the indemnified party shall be indemnified pursuant to the terms\nhereof. If the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in writing that the indemnifying party desires to accept such offer, but the indemnified\nparty refuses to accept such offer within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the indemnified party may continue to contest such claim\nand, in such event, the total maximum liability of the indemnifying party to indemnify or otherwise reimburse the indemnified party hereunder with respect\nto such claim shall be limited to and shall not exceed the amount of such offer, plus reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements) to the date of notice that the indemnifying party desires to accept such offer\u037e provided that this sentence shall not\napply to any settlement of any claim involving the imposition of equitable remedies, to any settlement imposing any material obligations on such\nindemnified party other than financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder, or to any settlement that does not\ninclude an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such claim or proceeding. An\nindemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense or a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than\none counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim in any one jurisdiction, unless in the written opinion of\ncounsel to the indemnified party, reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party, use of one counsel would be expected to give rise to a conflict of\ninterest between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall\nbe obligated to pay the fees and expenses of each additional counsel.\n(d)    Other Indemnification. Indemnification similar to that specified in this Section 4 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Corporation\nand each selling Apollo Stockholder with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under federal or state law or regulation of\ngovernmental authority other than the Securities Act.\n(e)    Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provided for in Section 4(a) and Section 4(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient\nto hold such indemnified party harmless as contemplated by Section 4(a) and Section 4(b), then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount\npaid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the\nrelative benefits received by the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, but also the relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying\nparty, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations\u037e provided that no selling Apollo Stockholder shall be required to contribute in an amount\ngreater than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such selling Apollo Stockholder with respect to the sale of any securities hereunder. No\nPerson guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person\nwho was not itself guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.\n \n-8-\nTable of Contents\nExhibit F\nWritten Consent of the Sole Stockholder\n \n-9-\nTable of Contents\nExhibit G\nParent Tax Certificate\n \n-10-\nTable of Contents\nExhibit H\nCompany Tax Certificate\n \n-10-\nTable of Contents\nAnnex B\nCERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT TO\nCERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF\nSYNNEX CORPORATION\nSYNNEX Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, hereby certifies as follows:\nFIRST: The name of the corporation is SYNNEX Corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d).

In the event that a vacancy is created at any time by the death, disqualification, resignation, removal or failure to be\nelected by the Company stockholders (and no other director has been elected by the stockholders of the Corporation to fill such vacancy) of an Apollo\nDirector nominated pursuant to Section 2(a), or designated pursuant to this Section 2(c), the Apollo Majority shall have the right to designate a\nreplacement to fill such vacancy for the Apollo Director consistent with the provisions of Section 2(a) (including being reasonably acceptable to the\nBoard, excluding the Apollo Directors), and if the Apollo Majority exercises such right, the Board shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such\ndesignee to be promptly appointed to the Board to fill such vacancy, subject to applicable law.\n(d)    Removal of Directors. Upon the written request of the Apollo Majority seeking to remove and/or replace an Apollo Director nominated pursuant to\nSection 2(a), or designated pursuant to Section 2(c), the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with such request, including\nto promptly call a special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation\u037e provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call more than a\ntotal of two special meetings with respect to the removal of Apollo Directors.\n(e)    Committees.

A Registration Request which does not result in an effective registration under the\nSecurities Act or a Registration Request that is withdrawn prior to the filing of the requested Registration Statement shall not be counted as a\nRegistration Request for purposes of the limits in the preceding sentence. All Registration Requests made pursuant to this Section 2 will specify the\naggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be registered and will also specify the intended methods of disposition thereof.\n(b)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Corporation\u2019s receipt of information from the Apollo Stockholders that is required by\napplicable law to be included in such Shelf Registration regarding such Apollo Stockholders, within two Business Days after the Closing Date, the\nCorporation shall file an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3ASR covering resales of the Registrable Securities by the Apollo\nStockholders, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement effective for a period of 3 years following the Closing\nDate. In addition, (i) at any time that the Corporation is qualified for the use of Form S-3 promulgated under the Securities Act or any successor form\nthereto, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to request in writing registration under the Securities Act of all or any portion of the Registrable\nSecurities beneficially owned by any member of the Apollo Stockholders group on Form S-3 (or any successor form) or any similar short form registration\nstatement, if available (a \u201cShort-Form Registration\u201d) and (ii) at any time, and from time to time, that the initial registration statement on Form S-3ASR or\nother shelf registration statements is not in effect or will expire within 90 days, the Apollo Stockholders may request in writing a shelf offering on a\ndelayed or continuous basis in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act (including the registration statement referred to in the immediately\nprecedent sentence, a \u201cShelf Registration\u201d), in which case the provisions of this Section 2(b) shall be applicable, provided that the Apollo Stockholders\nmay only make two Registration Requests, written requests for Short Form Registration, or written requests for Shelf Registration, in the aggregate, in any\nrolling twelve month period. All written requests for Short Form Registration shall (i) specify the aggregate number of Registrable Securities intended to\nbe sold or disposed of, (ii) state the intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities and (iii) whether or not such Short Form Registration\nshall be a Shelf Registration, and upon receipt of such request, the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to effect the\nregistration under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities so requested to be registered. Any Apollo Stockholder whose Registrable Securities are\nincluded in an effective Shelf Registration (a \u201cShelf Holder\u201d) may initiate an offering or sale of all or part of such Registrable Securities (a \u201cShelf Take-\nDown\u201d). If the Shelf Holders elect in a written request delivered to the Corporation (an \u201cUnderwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice\u201d), a Shelf Take-Down may\nbe in the form of an Underwritten Offering (an \u201cUnderwritten Shelf Take-Down\u201d) and, if necessary, the Corporation shall file and effect an amendment or\nsupplement to its Shelf Registration for such purpose as soon as practicable. The Shelf Holders shall indicate in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down\nNotice whether they intend for such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to involve a customary \u201croad show\u201d (including an \u201celectronic road show\u201d) or other\nmarketing effort by the underwriters (a \u201cMarketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down\u201d). If the Shelf Holders desire to effect a Shelf Take-Down that does not\nconstitute a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, and that does not involve an Underwritten Offering (a \u201cNon-Marketed Shelf Take-Down\u201d), the\nShelf Holders shall so indicate in a written request delivered to the Corporation no later than two calendar days prior to the expected\n \nE-17\nTable of Contents\ndate of such Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down, which request shall include (i) the total number of Registrable Securities expected to be offered and sold in\nsuch Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down, (ii) the expected plan of distribution of such Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down and (iii) the action or actions required\n(including the timing thereof) in connection with such Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down, and, if necessary, the Corporation shall file and effect an\namendment or supplement to its Shelf Registration for such purpose as soon as practicable. All determinations as to whether to complete any Non-\nMarketed Shelf Take-Down and as to the timing, manner, price and other terms of any Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down shall be at the discretion of the\nShelf Holders. The Corporation shall not be required to effect more than three Underwritten Shelf Take Downs in any rolling twelve-month period and\nshall not be required to effect any Underwritten Shelf Take Down unless the aggregate gross proceeds expected to be received from the sale of\nRegistrable Securities in such offering is at least $100 million.\n(c)    Subject to the provisions of this Section 2, promptly upon receipt of any such Registration Request, the Corporation will use commercially\nreasonable efforts to effect such registration under the Securities Act within 120 days of such request (subject to any lock-up restrictions) of the\nRegistrable Securities that the Corporation has been so requested to register, including, without limitation, filing post-effective amendments, appropriate\nqualification under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with the applicable regulations promulgated under the\nSecurities Act. At any time prior to the registration, the Apollo Stockholders may revoke a Registration Request by providing a notice to the Corporation\nrevoking such Registration Request.\n(d)    If the Corporation receives a Registration Request and the Corporation furnishes to the Apollo Stockholders a copy of a resolution of the Board\n(certified by the secretary of the Corporation) stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be materially adverse to the Corporation for a\nRegistration Statement (or an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down or a Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down) to be filed or effected on or before the date such filing\nor take-downs would otherwise be required hereunder, the Corporation shall have the right to defer such filing or take-downs for a period of not more\nthan sixty (60) days after the date such filing or take-downs would otherwise be required hereunder (provided that such sixty (60) day period may be\nextended to a period of up to ninety (90) days to the extent such suspension is due to ongoing negotiations or discussions regarding a material merger,\nacquisition or other similar transaction and the requirements for such deferral set forth in this sentence continue to be satisfied. If the Corporation\nfurnishes to the Apollo Stockholders a copy of a resolution of the Board (certified by the secretary of the Corporation) stating that in the good faith\njudgment of the Board it would be materially adverse to the Corporation to continue to permit the use of any prospectus contained any Shelf Registration\nStatement, the Corporation shall be entitled to suspend the use of such prospectus for a reasonable period of time not to exceed (i) sixty (60) days in\nsuccession (provided that such consecutive sixty (60) day period may be extended to a period of up to ninety (90) days in succession to the extent such\nsuspension is due to ongoing negotiations or discussions regarding a material merger, acquisition or other similar transaction and the requirements for\nsuch suspension set forth in this sentence continue to be satisfied (the \u201cExtension Period\u201d)) or (ii) ninety (90) days in the aggregate in any rolling twelve\n(12) month period if the Extension Period has not been triggered or (iii) one hundred twenty (120) days in the aggregate in any rolling twelve month period\nif the Extension Period has been triggered. The Corporation shall not be permitted to take such action in the foregoing sentences more than twice in any\n360-day period (except that the Corporation shall be able to use this right more than twice in any 12-month period if the Corporation is exercising such\nright during the 15-day period prior to the Corporation\u2019s regularly scheduled quarterly earnings announcement date and the total number of days of\npostponement in such 12-month period does not exceed 120 days). If the Corporation shall so postpone the filing of a Registration Statement, the Apollo\nStockholders may withdraw their Registration Request by so advising the Corporation in writing. In addition, if the Corporation receives a Registration\nRequest and the Corporation is then in the process of preparing to register Common Stock in connection with a primary offering, the Corporation shall\ninform the Apollo Stockholders of the Corporation\u2019s intent to engage in a primary offering and may require the Apollo Stockholders to withdraw such\nRegistration Request for a period of up to 90 days so that the Corporation may complete its offering. In the event that the Corporation ceases to pursue\nsuch primary offering, it shall promptly inform the Apollo Stockholders in writing and the Apollo Stockholders shall be permitted to submit a new\nRegistration Request. For the avoidance of\n \nE-18\nTable of Contents\ndoubt, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to participate in the Corporation\u2019s primary offering as provided in Section 3 (and notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary in Section 3, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to piggyback on the Corporation\u2019s primary offering).\n(e)    Registrations under this Section 2 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the SEC (i) as shall be selected by the Apollo Stockholders and\nas shall be reasonably acceptable to the Corporation and (ii) as shall permit the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended\nmethod or methods of disposition specified in the Registration Request. If, in connection with any registration under this Section 2 that is proposed by\nthe Apollo Stockholders to be on Form S-3 or any successor form, the managing underwriter, if any, shall advise the Apollo Stockholders or the\nCorporation in writing that in its opinion the use of another permitted form is of material importance to the success of the offering, then such registration\nshall be on such other permitted form.\n(f)    The Corporation shall use its best efforts to keep any Registration Statement filed in response to a Registration Request effective for as long as is\nnecessary for the Apollo Stockholders to dispose of all of the covered securities.\n(g)    In the case of an Underwritten Offering that is the subject of a Registration Request, the Apollo Stockholders shall select the underwriter(s)\n(including the roles thereof)\u037e provided that such selection is reasonably acceptable to the Corporation.\n(h)    From and after the date hereof until the termination of the Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain eligibility\nto be able to file and use a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form thereto) and to be a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d within the\nmeaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act.\nSection 3.    Piggyback Registration Right.\n(a)    Participation. Subject to Section 3(b), if the Corporation proposes to file a Registration Statement, whether on its own behalf or in connection with\nthe exercise of any registration rights by any holder of Registrable Securities possessing such rights (other than (i) a registration relating solely to an\nemployee benefit plan or employee stock plan, a dividend reinvestment plan, or a merger or a consolidation, (ii) a registration incidental to an issuance of\ndebt securities under Rule 144A, (iii) a registration on Form S-4 or any successor form or (iv) a registration on Form S-8 or any successor form), with\nrespect to an offering (for its own account or otherwise, and including any registration pursuant to Section 2) that includes any Registrable Securities,\nthen the Corporation shall give prompt notice (the \u201cInitial Notice\u201d) to the Apollo Stockholders, and the Apollo Stockholders shall be entitled to include in\nsuch Registration Statement the Registrable Securities held by them. The Initial Notice shall offer the Apollo Stockholders the right, subject to\nSection 3(b) (the \u201cPiggyback Registration Right\u201d), to register such number of shares of Registrable Securities as each such Apollo Stockholders may\nrequest and shall set forth (A) the anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement and (B) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities that is\nproposed to be included in such Registration Statement. Subject to Section 3(b), the Corporation shall include in such Registration Statement such\nRegistrable Securities for which it has received written requests to register within ten (10) days after the Initial Notice has been given.\n(b)    Underwriters\u2019 Cutback. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration pursuant to Section 2 or this Section 3 involves an Underwritten Offering\nand the managing underwriter(s) of such proposed Underwritten Offering advises the Corporation or the Apollo Stockholders that the total or kind of\nsecurities that the Apollo Stockholders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable), or that\nthe inclusion of certain holders of the Registrable Securities in such offering, would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the price, timing or\ndistribution of the securities offered in such offering (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable), then the number of securities proposed to be\nincluded in such\n \nE-19\nTable of Contents\nregistration (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable) shall be allocated among the Corporation and the selling Apollo Stockholders and other\napplicable holders of the Registrable Securities, such that the number of securities that each such Person shall be entitled to sell in the Underwritten\nOffering (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable) shall be included in the following order:\n(i)    In the case of an exercise of any registration rights by the Apollo Stockholders or any other holder of Registrable Securities possessing such\nrights:\n(1)    first, the securities held by the Person(s) exercising such registration rights and the holders of registrable securities requested to be\nincluded in such registration pursuant to the terms of this Section 3 or pursuant to any other agreement containing piggyback registration\nrights, pro rata based upon the number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered by each such Person in connection with such\nregistration\u037e and\n(2)    second, the securities to be issued and sold by the Corporation in such registration.\n(ii)    In all other cases:\n(1)    first, the securities to be issued and sold by the Corporation in such registration\u037e and\n(2)    second, the securities held by the Apollo Stockholders or other applicable holders of registrable securities requested to be included in\nsuch registration pursuant to the terms of this Section 3 or pursuant to any other agreement containing piggyback registration rights, pro\nrata based upon the number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered by each such Person in connection with such registration.\n(c)    Corporation Control. Except for a Registration Statement being filed in connection with the exercise of a Registration Request, a Short Form\nRegistration or a Shelf Registration subject to Section 2, the Corporation may decline to file a Registration Statement after giving the Initial Notice, or\nwithdraw any such Registration Statement after filing but prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement\u037e provided that the Corporation shall\npromptly notify each Apollo Stockholder who was to participate in such offering in writing of any such action\u037e provided, further, that the Corporation\nshall bear all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Apollo Stockholder or otherwise in connection with such unfilled or\nwithdrawn Registration Statement, up to a maximum of $50,000 for the Apollo Stockholders in the aggregate, and no Apollo Stockholders shall be deemed\nto have made a Registration Request with respect to the unfilled or withdrawn Registration Statement. Except as provided in Section 2(g), the Corporation\nshall have sole discretion to select any and all underwriters that may participate in any Underwritten Offering.\n(d)    Participation in Underwritten Offerings. No Person may participate in any Underwritten Offering hereunder unless such Person agrees to sell such\nPerson\u2019s securities on the basis provided in any customary underwriting arrangements approved by the Corporation and provides the questionnaires,\npowers of attorney, customary indemnities, underwriting agreements, and other documents required for such underwriting arrangements. Nothing in this\nSection 3(d) shall be construed to create any additional rights regarding the piggyback registration of Registrable Securities in any Person otherwise than\nas set forth herein.\n(e)    Expenses. As between the Corporation and the Apollo Stockholders, the Corporation will pay all registration fees and other expenses in connection\nwith each registration of Registrable Securities requested pursuant to Section 2 and this Section 3\u037e provided that each Apollo Stockholder shall pay all\napplicable underwriting fees, discounts and similar charges (pro rata based on the securities sold) and that the Apollo Stockholders shall be entitled to a\nsingle counsel (at the Corporation\u2019s expense) to be selected by the Apollo Stockholders.\nSection 4.    Indemnification.\n(a)    Indemnification by the Corporation. The Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each selling Apollo\nStockholder, its officers, managers, employees,\n \nE-20\nTable of Contents\nrepresentatives, Affiliates, and any portfolio companies of any Apollo Stockholder or its Affiliates, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and\nexpenses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any omission or\nalleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as\nthe same may be caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Corporation by such selling Apollo Stockholder for use therein\u037e\nprovided, however, that the Corporation shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is caused\nby any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to\nstate therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent that such untrue\nstatement or omission was caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Corporation by such selling Apollo Stockholder\nexpressly for use therein and has not been corrected in a subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the securities to the Person\nasserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense.\n(b)    Indemnification by Selling Apollo Stockholder. Each selling Apollo Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted\nby law, the Corporation, its directors, officers, employees and representatives and each Person who controls the Corporation (within the meaning of the\nSecurities Act) against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities and expenses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact\ncontained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or\nnecessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent that such untrue statement or omission was caused by or contained in any\ninformation furnished in writing to the Corporation by such selling Apollo Stockholder expressly for use therein and has not been corrected in a\nsubsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the securities to the Person asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. In no\nevent shall the liability of any selling Apollo Stockholder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such selling\nApollo Stockholder upon the sale of the securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation (except in the event of liability for fraud by such selling\nApollo Stockholder). The Corporation and the selling Apollo Stockholder shall be entitled to receive indemnities from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer\nmanagers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, to the same extent as provided above with respect to information\nso furnished in writing by such Persons specifically for inclusion in any Registration Statement or Prospectus.\n(c)    Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt (but in any event within thirty\n(30) days after such Person has actual knowledge of the facts constituting the basis for indemnification) written notice to the indemnifying party of any\nclaim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably\nsatisfactory to the indemnified party\u037e provided, however, that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party\nof its obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure\u037e provided, further, however, that\nany Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such\nclaim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay\nsuch fees or expenses, (B) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of\nsuch claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person or (C) in the reasonable\njudgment of any such Person, based upon advice of counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party with\nrespect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the\nexpense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person). If such\ndefense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent\n(but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnified party shall not have any obligation to consent to any settlement involving the\nimposition of equitable remedies or involving the imposition of any material obligations on such\n \nE-21\nTable of Contents\nindemnified party other than financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder. No indemnified party will have any\nobligation to consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the\nclaimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Whenever the indemnified party or the\nindemnifying party receives a firm offer to settle a claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder, it shall promptly notify the other of such offer. If\nthe indemnifying party refuses to accept such offer within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such offer (or of notice thereof), such claim shall\ncontinue to be contested and, if such claim is within the scope of the indemnifying party\u2019s indemnity contained herein, the indemnified party shall be\nindemnified pursuant to the terms hereof. If the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in writing that the indemnifying party desires to accept\nsuch offer, but the indemnified party refuses to accept such offer within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the indemnified party may\ncontinue to contest such claim and, in such event, the total maximum liability of the indemnifying party to indemnify or otherwise reimburse the\nindemnified party hereunder with respect to such claim shall be limited to and shall not exceed the amount of such offer, plus reasonable out-of-pocket\ncosts and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements) to the date of notice that the indemnifying party desires to accept such\noffer\u037e provided that this sentence shall not apply to any settlement of any claim involving the imposition of equitable remedies, to any settlement\nimposing any material obligations on such indemnified party other than financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be indemnified\nhereunder, or to any settlement that does not include an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject\nmatter of such claim or proceeding. An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense or a claim will not be obligated to\npay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim in any one\njurisdiction, unless in the written opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party, use of one counsel\nwould be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such\nclaim, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of each additional counsel.\n(d)    Other Indemnification.

VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE \u00a7 25401\nBreidenbach, Laurie Simon Hodrick, Hau\nLee, Matthew Miau, Dwight Steffensen,\nAnn Vezina, Thomas Wurster, Duane\nZitzner, Andrea Zulberti, SYNNEX\nCorporation, and Tech Data Corporation,\n \n                     Defendants.\n \n  \n  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED\nPlaintiff, as and for his complaint for securities fraud under California Corporations Code \u00a725401, intentional misrepresentation and concealment, and\nnegligent misrepresentation and concealment, alleges upon personal knowledge as to himself and his own acts, and upon information and belief derived\nfrom, inter alia, documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and publicly available news sources, as to all other matters, as\nfollows:\nNATURE OF THE ACTION\n1. This lawsuit is brought pursuant to California Corporations Code \u00a725401 and the common law of California against SYNNEX Corporation (\u201cSYNNEX\u201d\nor the \u201cCompany\u201d), its board of directors (collectively the \u201cBoard\u201d or the \u201cDirector Defendants\u201d) as well as Tech Data Corporation (\u201cTech Data\u201d).\nPlaintiff, a shareholder of SYNNEX, asserts claims under California law in connection with SYNNEX\u2019s transfer of $ 1.61 billion in cash and 44 million newly\nissued shares of SYNNEX\u2019s common stock (the \u201cShare Issuance\u201d), representing 45% of SYNNEX\u2019s voting stock, to funds affiliated with private equity\nfund Apollo Global Management, Inc. (the \u201cApollo Funds\u201d) in exchange for Tech Data (the \u201cSale\u201d), a corporation wholly owned by the Apollo Funds.\nThe Sale consideration amounts to $7.2 billion, or $1.2 billion more than the $6 billion that the Apollo Funds paid to purchase Tech Data almost one\nyear ago. Even the valuation prepared by Defendants\u2019 financial advisor indicates that Defendants are overpaying for Tech Data.\n \nG-1\nCOMPLAINT FOR INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATIONTable of Contents\n2. The transaction is being driven by the Defendants\u2019 personal interests in empire building. The Sale will result in the combined company becoming the\nworld\u2019s largest IT distributor, nearly $10 billion larger than its nearest competitor. Following the Sale, Dennis Polk, SYNNEX\u2019s current Chief Executive\nOfficer, will serve as Executive Chairman of the combined Company and a majority of SYNNEX\u2019s current, highly compensated directors will become\ndirectors of the significantly larger, merged company and will receive additional compensation as a result of the merger.\n3. The Sale and Share Issuance are subject to the approval of the shareholders of SYNNEX, including Plaintiff.\n4. On or about May 3, 2021, in connection with soliciting action by Plaintiff in connection with the Sale and Share Issuance, the Defendants caused a\nproxy statement (the \u201cProxy\u201d) to be distributed to Plaintiff and other SYNNEX\u2019s shareholders soliciting and urging shareholders, including Plaintiff, to\nvote in favor of the Sale and Share Issuance.\n5. The Proxy violates California Corporations Code \u00a725401 and the common law of California because it contains intentionally false and misleading\nstatements regarding, among other things, the conflicts of interest of those promoting the Sale, and the financial information upon which SYNNEX\u2019s\nfinancial advisor, Duff & Phelps, LLC (\u201cDuff & Phelps\u201d), relied in formulating its opinion that the Sale consideration is fair to SYNNEX shareholders.\n6. This action seeks, inter alia, to enjoin the Defendants from continuing to violate California Corporations Code \u00a725401 and California common law and\nto remedy the false and misleading statements in the Proxy.\n7. This complaint asserts claims under California law only and specifically excludes, does not allege and disclaims any and all claims (i) asserted\nderivatively on behalf of the corporation, (ii) for breach of fiduciary duties, (iii) arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation\nLaw (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or the bylaws or the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, and/or (iv) governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nJURISDICTION\n8. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to the California Constitution, Article VI, Section 10, because this case is an\naction not given by statute to other trial courts.\n9. This Court has jurisdiction over the Defendants in this action pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. 410.10 because SYNNEX is headquartered and has its\nprincipal place of business in this State, the Director Defendants are residents of this State and/or and the improper conduct alleged in this Complaint\noccurred in and/or was directed at this state.\n10. Venue lies in this Court because certain Defendants, including, upon information and belief, Dwight Steffensen, are residents of San Luis Obispo\nCounty.\nTHE PARTIES\n11.

Defendant Fred Breidenbach (\u201cMr. Breidenbach\u201d) is a longstanding SYNNEX director having served as a director of the Company since 2003.\nMr. Breidenbach\u2019s interests are not aligned with those of Plaintiff and other SYNNEX\u2019s shareholders with regard to the Sale. Indeed, Defendants have\nadmitted that they have conflicts of interest with regard to the Sale. Among such conflicts are that certain of SYNNEX\u2019s directors may continue to serve\nas directors of the post-Sale company with concomitant lucrative compensation and/or may receive payments for outstanding equity awards they hold.\nThe Defendants have failed to disclose the extent to which Mr. Breidenbach will receive the above benefits. This Court has jurisdiction over\nMr. Breidenbach because he is a resident of California, SYNNEX is headquartered in California and because Mr. Breidenbach\u2019s actions challenged in this\nComplaint occurred in substantial part, were directed at, and/or were meant to have their primary effect in this state.\n16. Defendant Laurie Simon Hodrick (\u201cMs. Hodrick\u201d) has served as a director of the Company since 2019. Ms. Hodrick\u2019s interests are not aligned with\nthose of Plaintiff and other SYNNEX\u2019s shareholders with regard to the Sale.

Defendant Tech Data is a corporation headquartered at 5350 Tech Data Drive, Clearwater, Florida 33760. Tech Data is one of the world\u2019s largest\ntechnology distributors. Tech Data was a publicly traded corporation until June 2020 when it was acquired by the Apollo Funds for $6 billion. This Court\nhas jurisdiction over Tech Data because its actions challenged in this Complaint occurred in substantial part, were directed at, and/or were meant to have\ntheir primary effect in this state.\nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS\n25. On March 22, 2021, it was announced that SYNNEX would transfer $ 1.61 billion in cash and 44 million shares of SYNNEX\u2019s common stock to the\nApollo Funds in exchange for ownership of Tech Data. The Sale consideration amounts to $7.2 billion, or $1.2 billion more than the $6 billion that the\nApollo Funds paid to purchase Tech Data just over a year ago. As noted public company merger and acquisition expert and Delaware Vice Chancellor\nTravis Laster has written in a peer reviewed academic law journal:\nEmpirical studies of acquisitions consistently find that public company bidders often overpay for target\u2019s, imposing significant losses on\nbidder shareholders. Research also indicates that the losses represent true wealth destruction in the aggregate and not simply a wealth\ntransfer from bidder shareholders to target shareholders. Numerous studies have connected bidder overpayment with managerial agency\ncosts and behavioral biases that reflect management self-interest.\nAfra Afsharipour and J. Travis Laster, Enhanced Scrutiny on the Buy Side, 53 GEORGIA LAW REVIEW 443, 446 (2019) (citations omitted, emphasis\nadded).\n26. The Sale is being driven by Synnex management\u2019s interest in empire building. Notably, it will result in the combined company becoming the world\u2019s\nlargest IT distributor, nearly $ 10 billion larger than its nearest competitor. Following the Sale, Dennis Polk, SYNNEX\u2019s current Chief Executive Officer, will\nserve as Executive Chairman of the Company and six of SYNNEX\u2019s current directors will become directors of the combined $57 billion company and will\nbenefit from a merger-related increase in personal compensation that is material to each. See Afra Afsharipour and J. Travis Laster, Enhanced Scrutiny on\nthe Buy Side, 53 GEORGIA LAW REVIEW 443, 447-448, 453 (2019) (\u201c[n]umerous studies provide evidence that acquisitions offer significant benefits to\nthe bidder... in the form of increased compensation, power, and prestige\u201d which can contaminate a Board\u2019s judgment) (emphasis added).\n \nG-5\nCOMPLAINT FOR INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION\nTable of Contents\n27. The SYNNEX Board is highly entrenched. The average director has held his SYNNEX Board position for over 12 years, and several have remained on\nthe Board for nearly two decades.\n28. The Director Defendants have caused SYNNEX to complete 21 acquisitions since SYNNEX went public in 2003. This has resulted in substantial\nincreases in director and officer compensation, which is tied to SYNNEX\u2019s size and market capitalization.\n29. CEO Polk\u2019s compensation has tripled from $2,048,229 in 2015 to $6,202,995 in 2019. During that time, SYNNEX completed four large acquisitions\n(Minacs, Tigerspike, Westcon-Comstor Americas, Convergys).\n30. SYNNEX\u2019s long-tenured non-employee directors have also benefited richly from the Board\u2019s empire building strategy. Defendant Steffensen\u2019s director\ncompensation has increased from $ 199,132 in 2009 to $315,118 in 2020. Defendant Breidenbach\u2019s director compensation has increased from $ 159,339 in\n2009 to $235,118 in 2020. Defendant Miau\u2019s director compensation has increased from $ 165,411 in 2009 to $235,118 in 2020. Defendant Zitner\u2019s director\ncompensation has increased from $ 158,511 in 2009 to $249,026 in 2020. During that time, the Board caused SYNNEX to complete 13 acquisitions. The\nother non-employee directors have benefited from similar increases during their board tenure.\n31. Consistent with past practice, SYNNEX\u2019 acquisition of Tech Data is intended to and will likewise substantially and materially enhance director and\nofficer compensation.\n32. The Director Defendants have publicly admitted that their personal financial interests in transaction-related compensation pose a director conflict of\ninterest that provides each with an incentive to favor the Sale regardless of whether it is in the best interests of SYNNEX shareholders:\nSYNNEX\u2019 stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of SYNNEX have interests in the [Sale] that are different from, or\nin addition to, those of SYNNEX\u2019 stockholders generally. These interests include the continued employment of certain executive officers of\nSYNNEX by the combined company, the continued service of certain directors of SYNNEX as directors of the combined company, the treatment\nin the [Sale] of outstanding equity, equity-based and incentive awards, severance arrangements, other compensation and benefit arrangements,\nand the right to continued indemnification of former directors and officers by the combined company.\nProxy at 22 (emphasis added).\n33. In an attempt to justify this self-serving transaction, the Defendants have forecast large synergies \u2014- over $200 million \u2014- that the merger will\npurportedly yield. But even if the synergies are realized, the $7.2 billion in cash and stock that SYNNEX will pay for Tech Data is grossly in excess of its\nintrinsic value. The Board\u2019s own financial adviser, Duff & Phelps, concluded that Tech Data is worth no more than $7.182 billion, even if all of the\npredicted synergies are realized. And, without the synergies, Duff & Phelps concluded that Tech Data is worth as little as $5.542 billion. Thus, the\nDirector Defendants are overpaying anywhere from $38 million to $ 1.678 billion for Tech Data.\n34. Legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett has criticized boards for doing exactly what the SYNNEX Board is doing here:\noverpaying for a company that a CEO desires to acquire and using synergies to justify the acquisition:\nOnce [those who run a company] hunger[] for a deal, [they] will never lack for forecasts that justify the purchase. Subordinates will be\ncheering, envisioning enlarged domains and the compensation levels that typically increase with corporate size. Investment bankers,\nsmelling huge fees, will be applauding as well. (Don\u2019t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.) lf the historical performance of the\ntarget falls short of validating its acquisition, large \u201csynergies\u201d will be forecast. Spreadsheets never disappoint.\n \nG-6\nCOMPLAINT FOR INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION\nTable of Contents\nWarren Buffett, Letter to Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders, February 24, 2018 at 5 located at http://www.berkshirehathaway.corn/letters/20171tr.pdf\n(emphasis added).\n35. While the majority of SYNNEX\u2019s directors will benefit from the Sale, it is to the detriment of Plaintiff and other SYNNEX shareholders. Apart from the\nfact that SYNNEX is grossly overpaying for Tech Data, following the Sale, SYNNEX shareholders will own no more than approximately 55% of the\ncombined entity, while the remaining 45% block will be held by Apollo Funds. As a result, Apollo will have tremendous influence over the Company.\n \nB.\nThe Materially Misleading and/or Incomplete Proxy\n36. The Sale and Share Issuance Proposal are subject to the approval of SYNNEX\u2019s public shareholders, including Plaintiff.\n37. In connection therewith, SYNNEX has disseminated the Proxy to Plaintiff (and other SYNNEX shareholders) recommending that they vote in favor of\nthe Sale and Share Issuance. However, the Proxy misrepresents and/or omits material information as follows:\n \n \n(i)\nThe Defendants admit that they have interests in the Sale including the continued employment of certain executive officers of SYNNEX by\nthe combined company, the continued service of certain directors of SYNNEX as directors of the combined company, the treatment in the\nSale of outstanding equity, equity-based and incentive awards, severance arrangements, other compensation and benefit arrangements, and\nthe right to continued indemnification of former directors and officers. However, the Proxy does not disclose the extent of those interests\nwith regard to each of the Defendants. Among other things, the Proxy does not disclose (a) the identity of the directors who will continue to\nserve as directors of the combined company, (b) the compensation that the executive officers will receive in connection with their continued\nemployment, (c) the compensation that the continuing directors will receive, (d) the payments that each director will receive in connection\nwith the accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards, (e) the substance of any and all discussions had by SYNNEX\u2019s Board\nregarding the composition of the company\u2019s Board following the Sale, including the continuation of certain SYNNEX directors as directors\nof the post-Sale Company, and (f) the substance of any and all discussion had by the Board regarding the continuation of CEO Polk as the\nExecutive Chairman, of the post-Sale company.\nThe conflicts of interest of SYNNEX\u2019s directors are material and must be disclosed.\n \n \n(ii)\nAccording to the Proxy, during the two years preceding the date of its Fairness Opinion, Duff & Phelps provided financial opinions and\nvaluation services to SYNNEX and provided valuation services to Tech Data\u2019s private equity sponsor, Apollo and its affiliates (collectively\n\u201cApollo\u201d). The Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose (a) the total amounts paid by each of SYNNEX and Apollo to Duff & Phelps\nfor providing financial opinions and/or valuation services during the two years preceding the date of its Fairness Opinion, (b) the extent to\nwhich Duff & Phelps was providing services to Apollo and its affiliates at the same time it was advising SYNNEX on its acquisition of Tech\nData and rendering the Fairness Opinion on the same, including the nature of such services and (c) the extent to which Duff & Phelps has\nan expectation for providing future service to Apollo and the anticipated compensation in connection therewith.\nThe conflicts of interest of SYNNEX\u2019S financial advisor are material and must be disclosed.\n \n \n(iii)\nAccording to the Proxy, on February 24, 2021, representatives of Tech Data and Apollo provided representatives of SYNNEX with updates\n(the \u201cFebruary 24, 2021 Tech Data Projections\u201d) to the Tech Data financial information that had been provided on January 20, 2021 (the\n\u201cJanuary 20, 2021 Tech Data Projections\u201d), which updates showed an improvement to Tech Data\u2019 s financial forecasts. Also according to\nthe Proxy, in connection with formulating its Fairness Opinion, Duff & Phelps reviewed\n \nG-7\nCOMPLAINT FOR INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION\nTable of Contents\n \nfinancial projections for Tech Data prepared by Tech Data\u2019s management and also those as adjusted by SYNNEX\u2019 management. While the\nProxy provides a summary of the Tech Data Projections, it is deficient because it does not (a) identify whether that summary is of the\nJanuary 10, 2021 projections or the February 24, 2021 projections, (b) disclose what accounts for the improvement in Tech Data\u2019s financial\nforecasts, and (c) a summary of the missing set of projections, i.e. if the Tech Data projections included in the proxy are the January 20, 2021\nTech Data Projections, then the February 24, 2021 Tech Data Projections and vice versa.\nInformation upon which the Director Defendants and their advisors relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.\nThis is especially so where, as here, the Company is to pay a $1.6 billion premium over what the Apollo Funds paid for Tech Data less than\none year ago.\n \n \n(iv)\nAccording to public sources, in June 2020, the Apollo Funds purchased Tech Data for $6 billion. The Proxy fails to disclose the\n(a) substance of the discussions had by the Board regarding the payment of a $1.2 billion premium for Tech Data less than a year later and\n(b) the Board\u2019s rationale for failing to pursue Tech Data when it was for sale in 2019.\nInformation upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.\n \n \n(v)\nAccording to the Proxy, on February 18, 2021, the Board met via video conference to discuss the potential strategic transaction between\nSYNNEX and Tech Data. SYNNEX\u2019 management, among other things, provided an update on certain diligence matters, including recent\ndistributions to Apollo Funds\u2019 affiliate, Tiger Holdings and redemptions of certain Tiger Holdings units paid by Tech Data. Following this,\nthe Board discussed the various matters presented by management, including whether there should be a renegotiation of the consideration\nproposed in the transaction. The Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose the substance of the Board\u2019s discussion of a renegotiation\nof the consideration proposed in the transaction.\nInformation upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed. This is especially so\nwhere, as here, the Company is to pay a $1.6 billion premium over what the Apollo Funds paid for Tech Data less than one year ago.\n \n \n(vi)\nAccording to the Proxy, on February 23, 2021, the Board met via video conference to discuss the potential strategic transaction between\nSYNNEX and Tech Data. The Board discussed various matters relating to the transaction, including whether the purchase price should be\nrenegotiated. The Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose the substance of the Board\u2019s discussion regarding whether the purchase\nprice should be renegotiated.\nInformation upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed. This is especially so\nwhere, as here, the Company is to pay a $1.6 billion premium over what the Apollo Funds paid for Tech Data less than one year ago.\n \n \n(vii)\nAccording to the Proxy, at a March 2, 2021 meeting SYNNEX\u2019s management provided an update on, among other things, the composition of\nthe Board post-closing and the Board discussed the composition of the Board following the transaction and potential changes in\nmanagement. The Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose the substance of (a) SYNNEX\u2019s management\u2019s update on composition of\nthe Board post-closing and (b) the Board\u2019s discussion of the composition of the Board following the transaction and potential changes in\nmanagement.\nInformation upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.\n \n \n(viii)\nAccording to the Proxy, on March 10, 2021, representatives of each of Tech Data and Apollo called Mr. Polk to propose that, in addition to\nthe previously discussed purchase price of 44 million shares of SYNNEX common stock together with the $1.61 billion payout for\noutstanding preferred units of Tiger Holdings, Apollo make a $500 million equity contribution to Tech Data at the close of the\n \nG-8\nCOMPLAINT FOR INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION\nTable of Contents\n \ntransaction (which would result in a net cash payment for the outstanding preferred units to Tiger Holdings of $1.11 billion in the Sale). The\nProxy is deficient because it does not disclose the substance of Mr. Polk\u2019s discussion with Tech Data\u2019s and Apollo\u2019s representatives of\nTech Data and Apollo\u2019s proposal to make a $500 million equity contribution to Tech Data at the close of the transaction.\nInformation upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.\n \n \n(ix)\nAccording to the Proxy, at a March 11, 2021 Board meeting, the Board discussed the potential transaction, including the proposed\n$500 million investment by Apollo as well as the appropriate composition of the Board following the potential transaction. The Proxy is\ndeficient because it does not disclose the substance of the Board\u2019s discussion regarding (a) the proposed $500 million investment by\nApollo and (b) the appropriate composition of the Board following the potential transaction, including the identity of the SYNNEX\u2019s\ndirectors who would continue to serve on the Company\u2019s Board post-Sale.\nInformation upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.\n \n \n(x)\nAccording to the Proxy, at a March 15, 2021 Board meeting, the Board discussed, among other things, the proposed composition for the\nBoard following the closing and the appointment of the Apollo director designees.

As shareholders to whom the Proxy was disseminated, Defendants intended for Plaintiff (and the other SYNNEX shareholders) to rely on the\nmaterially false and misleading statements and omissions in the Proxy when voting on the Sale and Share Issuance.\n44. Plaintiff is justifiably entitled to rely on the integrity of the shareholder vote, which vote has been compromised by the materially false and misleading\nstatements and omissions by the Defendants in the Proxy disseminated to SYNNEX shareholders.\n45.

Plaintiff repeats and realleges all previous allegations as if set forth in full herein.\n56. On or about May 3, 2021, SYNNEX and the Director Defendants disseminated and circulated the Proxy to the shareholders of SYNNEX, including\nPlaintiff.\n57. The Proxy disseminated and circulated by the Defendants contains the materially false and misleading statements and omissions specified above.\n58. Tech Data participated in the dissemination of the Proxy by supplying information to SYNNEX with knowledge that it would be included in the Proxy.\n59. The statements and omissions are material because, among other things, they pertain to financial projections upon which SYNNEX\u2019s investment\nbanker relied in opining that the Sale is fair and the conflicts of interest of those promoting the Sale. A reasonable and prudent investor would attach\nimportance to the facts omitted or misrepresented in determining whether to vote for or against the Sale and Share Issuance.\n60. As members of SYNNEX\u2019s board of directors, the Director Defendants were responsible for and had ultimate authority over the false and misleading\nstatements and omissions in the Proxy, and intentionally and willfully disseminated the false, misleading and materially incomplete Proxy to SYNNEX\nshareholders with knowledge of its falsity intending SYNNEX shareholders to rely on the false and misleading statements and omissions.\n61. Defendants knew or had reasonable grounds to know that the statements specified above were misleading in that they contained misrepresentations\nand/or failed to disclose material facts necessary in order to make the statements, in the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,\n62.

This action concerns a proposed transaction (\u201cProposed Transaction\u201d) announced on March 22, 2021, pursuant to which SYNNEX Corp., (\u201cSYNNEX\u201d\nor the \u201cCompany\u201d) will merge with Tiger Parent Corporation (\u201cTiger Parent\u201d), the indirect parent of Tech Data Corporation (\u201cTech Data\u201d), which is wholly\nowned by funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (\u201cApollo Funds\u201d).\n2. On March 22, 2021, SYNNEX\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d or \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d) caused the Company to enter into an agreement and plan\nof merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Apollo Funds will receive 1.61 billion in cash and 44 million shares\nof SYNNEX common stock plus the refinancing of existing Tech Data net debt and redeemable preferred shares of approximately $2.7 billion. (the \u201cMerger\nConsideration\u201d).\n3. Upon closing of the transaction, SYNNEX shareholders will own approximately 55% of the combined company, with Apollo Funds owning\napproximately 45%.\n4. On May 3, 2021, in order to convince SYNNEX\u2019s Shareholders to vote in favor of the Proposed Transaction, Defendants filed a materially incomplete\nand misleading Proxy Statement (the \u201cProxy\u201d) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).\n5. The Proxy Statement omits material information with respect to the Proposed Transaction, which renders the Proxy Statement false and misleading.\nAccordingly, Plaintiff alleges herein that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201c1934 Act\u201d) in\nconnection with the Proxy.\n6. In addition, a special meeting of SYNNEX\u2019s stockholders will be held to vote on the Proposed Transaction (the \u201cStockholder Vote\u201d). It is therefore\nimperative that the material information that has been omitted from the Proxy is disclosed prior to the Stockholder Vote so SYNNEX\u2019s stockholders can\nproperly exercise their corporate voting rights and make an informed decision on whether to vote in favor of the merger.\n \nH-1",

This Court has jurisdiction over the claims asserted herein pursuant to Section 27 of the 1934 Act and 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331 because the claims asserted\nherein arise under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14a-9.\n8. This Court has jurisdiction over Defendants because each defendant is either a corporation that conducts business in this District, or is an individual\nwith sufficient minimum contacts with this District so as to make the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court permissible under traditional notions of fair play\nand substantial justice.\n9. Venue is proper in this District under Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa, as well as under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391, because, among other things:\n(a) the conduct at issue will have an effect in this District\u037e (b) a substantial portion of the transactions and wrongs complained of herein, occurred in this\nDistrict\u037e and (c) certain Defendants have received substantial compensation in this District by doing business here and engaging in numerous activities\nthat had an effect in this District. Additionally, the Company\u2019s shares trade on the NASDAQ, which is headquartered in this District.\nTHE PARTIES\n10. Plaintiff is, and has been continuously throughout all times relevant hereto, a SYNNEX shareholder.\n11. Defendant SYNNEX is a Delaware corporation and a party to the Merger Agreement. SYNNEX shares are traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol\n\u201cSNX.\u201d\n12. Defendant Kevin Murai is Chairman of the Board.\n13. Defendant Dennis Polk is the Company\u2019s President, Chief Financial Officer, and a director of the Company.\n14. Defendant Fred Breidenbach is a director of the Company.\n15. Defendant Laurie Simon Hodrick is a director of the Company.\n16. Defendant Hau Lee is a director of the Company.\n17. Defendant Matthew Miau is director of the Company.\n18. Defendant Dwight Steffensen is a director of the Company.\n19. Defendant Ann Vezina is a director of the Company.\n20. Defendant Thomas Wurster is a director of the Company.\n21. Defendant Duane Zitzner is a director of the Company.\n22. Defendant Andrea Zulberti is a director of the Company.\nFACTS\n23. SYNNEX is a fortune 200 corporation specializing in IT distribution and providing comprehensive logistics, integration services, and technology\nsolutions to help customers and business partners grow and enhance their customer-engagement strategies. SYNNEX operates in numerous countries\nthroughout North and South America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe.\n \nH-2\nTable of Contents\n24. Tiger Parent, a Delaware corporation, is the indirect parent of Tech Data, a Florida corporation. Tech Data\u2019s end-to-end portfolio of products, services\nand solutions, highly specialized skills, and expertise in next-generation technologies enable channel partners to bring to market the products and\nsolutions the world needs to connect, grow, and advance. Tech Data is ranked No. 90 on the Fortune 500 and has been named one of Fortune\u2019s World\u2019s\nMost Admired Companies for 11 straight years.\n25. On March 22, 2021, SYNNEX\u2019s Board caused the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement.\nAccording to the press release announcing the Proposed Transaction:\nFREMONT, CA and CLEARWATER, FL, March 22, 2021 \u2013 SYNNEX Corporation (NYSE: SNX) and Tech Data today announced they have entered\ninto a definitive merger agreement under which SYNNEX and Tech Data will combine in a transaction valued at approximately $7.2 billion, including\nnet debt. The combined company, with approximately $57 billion in estimated pro forma annual revenues and a team of over 22,000 associates and\ncolleagues, will provide customers and vendors with expansive reach across products, services, and geographies to accelerate technology\nadoption.\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with a world-class industry leader like Tech Data and believe that this combination will benefit all our stakeholders,\u201d said\nDennis Polk, SYNNEX President and CEO. \u201cThis transaction allows for accelerated revenue and earnings growth, an expanded global footprint, and\nthe ability to drive significant operating improvements while continuing to create shareholder value. We look forward to working with the talented\ncolleagues at Tech Data and expect our combined business will create the opportunity for team members to produce the highest levels of service to\nour partners.\u201d\n\u201cThis is transformational for Tech Data, SYNNEX and the entire technology ecosystem. Together, we will be able to offer our customers and\nvendors exceptional reach, efficiency, and expertise, redefining the experience and value they receive,\u201d said Rich Hume, Tech Data CEO. \u201cThe\ncombined company will also benefit from significant financial strength to invest in its core growth platform as well as next generation cybersecurity,\ncloud, data, and IoT technologies, which are experiencing explosive growth due to work from home and return to office trends. We could not have\nreached this milestone without the hard work of our colleagues, and we look forward to working together with the SYNNEX team to seamlessly\nbring our companies together and to create meaningful value for all our stakeholders.\u201d\n***\nKey Transaction Details\n \n \n\u2022\n Under the terms of the agreement, Apollo Funds will receive an aggregate of 44 million shares of SYNNEX common stock plus the\nrefinancing of existing Tech Data net debt and redeemable preferred shares of approximately $2.7 billion.\n \n \n\u2022\n Upon closing of the transaction, SYNNEX shareholders will own approximately 55% of the combined entity, with Apollo Funds owning\napproximately 45%.\n \n \n\u2022\n Rich Hume will lead the combined company as CEO. Dennis Polk will be Executive Chair of the Board of Directors and will take an active role\nin the ongoing strategy and integration of the business, among other responsibilities.\n \n \n\u2022\n The combined company will have an eleven-member board, including Rich Hume, with six individuals appointed by SYNNEX and with\nApollo Funds to have Board designation rights based on ownership, initially including four total directors, two of whom will be\nindependent.\n \n \n\u2022\n Non-GAAP diluted EPS accretion of more than 25% is expected in year one post close, with further accretion expected in year two.\n \n \n\u2022\n Net optimization and synergy benefits of $100 million are expected in the first year after closing, achieving a minimum of $200 million by the\nend of the second year.\n \nH-3\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n The combined company will benefit from a strong financial foundation and an investment grade profile. Based on LTM pro-forma adjusted\nEBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion and expected combined debt of approximately $4.0 billion at close, debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is\nexpected to be approximately 2.7x at transaction close and is expected to decline to approximately 2x within 12 months.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including\napproval by SYNNEX stockholders and regulatory approvals. MiTAC Holdings Corporation and its affiliates, which collectively owned\napproximately 17% of SYNNEX shares as of January 22, 2021, have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the transaction. Until the transaction is\ncompleted, the companies will continue to operate independently.\n***\n26. The Merger Consideration is unfair because, among other things, the intrinsic value of the Company is in excess of the amount the Company\u2019s\nstockholders will receive in connection with the Proposed Transaction.\n27. It is therefore imperative that the Company\u2019s shareholders receive the material information that Defendants have omitted from the Proxy so that they\ncan meaningfully assess whether the Proposed Transaction is in their best interests prior to the vote.\n28. Section 7.10 of the Merger Agreement has an \u201cacquisition proposals\u201d clause that prevents SYNNEX from soliciting alternative proposals and\nconstraints its ability to negotiate with potential buyers:\n(a) Acquisition Proposals\nEach party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers not to, and shall not\npermit its and their other respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any\ninquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any\nAcquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with any person\nrelating to any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any term\nsheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other\nagreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with\nthis Section 7.10) in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Each party will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately\ncease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other\nthan Parent or the Company, as applicable, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and request the return or destruction of any confidential\ninformation previously delivered to any such person pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement to the extent provided by such\nagreement.\n29. In addition, Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement requires SYNNEX to pay up to $131,683,200.00 \u201ctermination fee\u201d in the event this agreement is\nterminated by SYNNEX and improperly constrains the Company from obtaining a superior offer. Such a termination fee is excessive and unduly restrictive\nto SYNNEX\u2019s ability to consider other offers.\n30. Defendants filed the Proxy with the SEC in connection with the Proposed Transaction.\n31. The Proxy omits material information concerning SYNNEX\u2019s and Tech Data\u2019s financial projections and some of the significant factors considered by\nthe Board supporting its decision to approve the Merger.\n \nH-4\nTable of Contents\n32. With respect to SYNNEX\u2019s financial projections, the Proxy fails to disclose (i) all line items used to calculate non-GAPP net income and adjusted\nEBITDA\u037e and (ii) a reconciliation of all non-GAAP to GAAP metrics.\n33. With respect to Tech Data\u2019s financial projections, the Proxy fails to disclose (i) all line items used to calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash\nflow\u037e and (ii) a reconciliation of all non-GAAP to GAAP metrics.\n34. The disclosure of projected financial information is material information necessary for stockholders to gain an understanding of the basis for any\nprojections as to the future financial performance of the combined company. In addition, this information is material and necessary for stockholders to\nunderstand the financial analyses performed by the companies\u2019 financial advisors rendered in support of any fairness opinion.\n35. Second, the Proxy omits material information regarding the analyses performed by the Company\u2019s financial advisor Duff Phelps, LLC (\u201cDuff Phelps\nAdvisors\u201d) in connection with the Proposed Transaction.\n36. With respect to Duff Phelps Advisors\u2019 Discounted Cash Flow Analyses for Tech Data, the Proxy fails to disclose (1) unlevered free cash flows and all\nunderlying line items\u037e (2) the terminal/continuing value of the Company\u037e (3) the individual inputs and assumptions underlying the (i) discount rate range\nof 10% to 11% (ii) terminal growth rates of 2.5%, (4) the alternative investment opportunities with similar risk profiles from which security holders could\nexpect a similar rate of return.\n37. With respect to Duff Phelps Advisors\u2019 Selected Public Company Analyses for Tech Data, the Proxy fails to disclose Duff Phelps\u2019s bases for selecting\neach of the companies observed.\n38. With respect to Duff Phelps Advisors\u2019 Public Companies / Selected M&A Transactions Analyses for Tech Data, the Proxy fails to disclose the\nindividual inputs and assumptions underlying the (i) LTM EBITDA multiple ranged of 9.0x to 10.0x\u037e (ii) NTM EBITDA multiple ranged of 8.5x to 9.5x\u037e and\n(iii) NTM + 1 EBITDA multiple ranged of 8.0x to 9.0x.\n39. With respect to Duff Phelps Advisors\u2019 Discounted Cash Flow Analyses for SYNNEX, the individual inputs and assumptions underlying the\n(i) discount rate range of 10% to 11% and (ii) terminal growth rate of 2.5%\n40. With respect to Duff Phelps Advisors\u2019 Synergies Analyses the Proxy fails to disclose (1) the projected net Synergies for fiscal years January 2022 to\nJanuary 2024\u037e (2) the terminal/continuing value of net Synergies\u037e the individual inputs and assumptions underlying terminal growth rate of 2.5% .\n41. Third, the Proxy Statement fails to disclose the terms of the confidentiality agreements, including whether the agreements contained standstill and/or\n\u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provisions.\n42. Fourth, the Proxy fails to disclose sufficient information regarding communications about post-transaction employment and directorship during the\nnegotiation of the Proposed Transaction.\n43. Fifth, the Proxy omits material information regarding the engagement of Duff Phelps including the amount of the customary fees, expense\nreimbursement, and indemnification Duff Phelps received from SYNNEX during the two years preceding the date of its Opinion and the amount of the\nhourly rates Duff Phelps will charge for any time incurred should Duff & Phelps becalled upon to support its findings subsequent to the delivery of its\nOpinion.\n \nH-5\nTable of Contents\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nCOUNT I\n(AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS FOR VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 14(a) OF THE\nEXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 14a-9 PROMULGATED THEREUNDER)\n44. Plaintiff incorporates each and every allegation set forth above as if fully set forth herein.\n45. Rule 14a-9, promulgated by the SEC pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, requires that proxy communications with stockholders shall not\ncontain \u201cany statement which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material\nfact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a -9.\n46. Defendants issued the Proxy with the intention of soliciting stockholder support for the Proposed Transaction. Each of the Defendants reviewed and\nauthorized the dissemination of the Proxy and the use of their name in the Proxy, which fails to provide critical information regarding, among other things,\nthe financial projections that were prepared by the Company and relied upon by the Board in recommending the Company\u2019s stockholders vote in favor of\nthe Proposed Transaction.\n47. In so doing, Defendants made untrue statements of fact and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading. By\nvirtue of their roles as officers and/or directors, each of the Individual Defendants were aware of the omitted information but failed to disclose such\ninformation, in violation of Section 14(a). The Individual Defendants were therefore negligent, as they had reasonable grounds to believe material facts\nexisted that were misstated or omitted from the Proxy, but nonetheless failed to obtain and disclose such information to stockholders as required.\n48. The preparation of a Proxy by corporate insiders containing materially false or misleading statements or omitting a material fact constitutes negligence.\nDefendants were negligent in preparing and reviewing the Proxy. Defendants were also negligent in choosing to omit material information from the Proxy\nor failing to notice the material omissions in the Proxy upon reviewing it, which they were required to do carefully.\n49. The misrepresentations and omissions in the Proxy are material to Plaintiff, who will be deprived of her right to cast an informed vote if such\nmisrepresentations and omissions are not corrected prior to the vote on the Proposed Transaction. Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.\nCOUNT II\n(AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS FOR VIOLATIONS OF\nSECTION 20(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT)\n50. Plaintiff incorporates each and every allegation set forth above as if fully set forth herein.\n51. The Individual Defendants acted as controlling persons of the Company within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as alleged herein.\nBy virtue of their positions as directors of the Company, and participation in and/or awareness of the Company\u2019s operations and/or intimate knowledge of\nthe incomplete and misleading statements contained in the Proxy filed with the SEC, they had the power to influence and control and did influence and\ncontrol, directly or indirectly, the decision making of the Company, including the content and dissemination of the various statements that Plaintiff\ncontends are materially incomplete and misleading.\n \nH-6\nTable of Contents\n52. Each of the Individual Defendants was provided with or had unlimited access to copies of the Proxy and other statements alleged by Plaintiff to be\nmisleading prior to and/or shortly after these statements were issued and had the ability to prevent the issuance of the statements or cause the\nstatements to be corrected.\n53. In particular, each of the Individual Defendants had direct and supervisory involvement in the day-to-day operations of the Company, and, therefore,\nis presumed to have had the power to control or influence the particular transactions giving rise to the Exchange Act violations alleged herein, and\nexercised the same. The omitted information identified above was reviewed by the Board prior to voting on the Proposed Transaction. The Proxy at issue\ncontains the unanimous recommendation of the Board to approve the Proposed Transaction. The Individual Defendants were thus directly involved in\nthe making of the Proxy.\n54. In addition, as the Proxy sets forth at length, and as described herein, the Individual Defendants were involved in negotiating, reviewing, and\napproving the Merger Agreement. The Proxy purports to describe the various issues and information that the Individual Defendants reviewed and\nconsidered. The Individual Defendants participated in drafting and/or gave their input on the content of those descriptions.\n55. By virtue of the foregoing, the Individual Defendants have violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.\n56. As set forth above, the Individual Defendants had the ability to exercise control over and did control a person or persons who have each violated\nSection 14(a) and Rule 14a-9, by their acts and omissions as alleged herein. By virtue of their positions as controlling persons, these defendants are liable\npursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. As a direct and proximate result of Individual Defendants\u2019 conduct, Plaintiff will be irreparably harmed.\n57. Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment and relief as follows:\nA. Preliminarily and permanently enjoining defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the\nProposed Transaction\u037e\nB. In the event defendants consummate the Proposed Transaction, rescinding it and setting it aside or awarding rescissory damages\u037e\nC. Directing the Individual Defendants to disseminate a proxy that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all material\nfacts required in it or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading\u037e\nD. Declaring that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the 1934 Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder\u037e\nE. Awarding Plaintiff the costs of this action, including reasonable allowance for Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees\u037e and\nF. Granting such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\n \nH-7\nTable of Contents\nJURY DEMAND\nPlaintiff hereby requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.\nDated: May 27, 2021\n \nMOORE KUEHN, PLLC\n/s/Justin Kuehn\nJustin A.
