            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the\nspecial meeting of stockholders and the Merger. These questions and answers do not address all questions that may\nbe important to you as a Magellan stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere\nin this proxy statement, the Annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\nA:\nOn January 4, 2021, Magellan entered into the Merger Agreement with Centene and Merger Sub. You are\nreceiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board in favor of the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nAs a stockholder, what will I receive in the Merger?\nA:\nIf the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $95.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of\nMagellan common stock you own as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For further information, see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration Received by Magellan Stockholders,\u201d beginning\non page 77.\nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?\nA:\nIf you are a U.S. Holder (as such term is defined below in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d), the exchange of shares of Magellan common stock for cash\npursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will\nrequire a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and such U.S.\nHolder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Magellan common stock surrendered in the Merger.\nA Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger\u201d) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the\nexchange of shares of Magellan common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain\nconnections to the United States.\nBecause particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances\n(including with respect to any tax consequences to holders or beneficial owners of options or other equity\nawards participating in the Merger or transactions in connection with the Merger with respect to such options\nor equity awards) and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state,\nlocal or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences\nof the Merger is provided below under the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 72.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to outstanding Magellan equity compensation awards in the Merger?\nA:\nFor information regarding the treatment of outstanding Magellan equity awards, see the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\u037e Company ESPP,\u201d beginning on page 78.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to the Company ESPP?\nA:\nFor information regarding the treatment of Company ESPP, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-\nTreatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\u037e Company ESPP,\u201d beginning on page 78.\nQ:\nWhen and where will the special meeting of stockholders be held?\nA:\nThe special meeting of Magellan stockholders will be held via live webcast on March 31, 2021, at 8:30 a.m.,\nCentral Time. The special meeting can be accessed by visiting\n12TABLE OF CONTENTS\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MGLN2021SM, where you will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote\nonline. We encourage you to allow ample time for online check-in, which will open at 8:15 a.m., Central Time.\nPlease note that you will not be able to attend the virtual special meeting in person.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nOnly holders of record of Magellan common stock as of the close of business on February 12, 2021, the record\ndate for the special meeting, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. You will be entitled to\none vote on each of the proposals presented in this proxy statement for each share of Magellan common stock\nthat you held as of the close of business on the record date.\nQ:\nWhat proposals will be considered at the special meeting?\nA:\nAt the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on:\n\u2022\na proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\na proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become\npayable to Magellan\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as\ndiscussed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger,\u201d beginning on page 65\u037e and\n\u2022\na proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate, including\nto solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are\ninsufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve each of the proposals?\nA:\nThe proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of Magellan common stock entitled to vote thereon at the special meeting. Abstentions and\nfailure to vote will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nThe approval of the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of shares of Magellan common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting\nwebsite or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. Although the Board intends to consider the\nvote resulting from this proposal, the vote is advisory only and, therefore, is not binding on Magellan or\nCentene or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Magellan\nstockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger\nwill be payable to our named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved. Failure to vote will have no\neffect on approval of the proposal\u037e however, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal.\nThe approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative\nvote of a majority of shares of Magellan common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual\nmeeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. In addition, even if a quorum is not\npresent at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the shares of Magellan\ncommon stock present, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such\nmatter may adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time. Failure to vote will have no effect on approval of\nthe proposal\u037e however, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal.\nQ:\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?\nA:\nAfter careful consideration, the Board has unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement\nand the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\ndetermined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, directed that the\nMerger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption, and unanimously\nrecommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, \u201cFOR\u201d the non-binding\nMerger-related compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adjourn the special meeting if necessary or\nappropriate.\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the\nMerger Agreement,\u201d beginning on page 43. In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Board with\nrespect to the Merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests that may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, the interests of Magellan stockholders generally. See the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 65.\nQ:\nDo I need to attend the special meeting?\nA:\nNo. It is not necessary for you to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. If you are a\nstockholder of record as of the record date, you may vote by mail, by telephone or through the internet, as\ndescribed in more detail below. If you are a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares, you must follow the voting\ninstructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee for your shares to be voted at the\nspecial meeting, as described in more detail below.\nQ:\nHow many shares of Magellan common stock need to be represented at the special meeting?\nA:\nThe presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of\nshares of Magellan common stock representing a majority of the votes which all holders of shares of Magellan\ncommon stock are entitled to cast constitutes a quorum for the purpose of considering the proposals. As of\nFebruary 12, 2021, there were 25,965,226 shares of Magellan common stock outstanding. If you are a Magellan\nstockholder as of the close of business on the record date and you vote by mail, by telephone, through the\ninternet or at the special meeting via the virtual meeting website, you will be considered part of the quorum. If\nyou are a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares of Magellan common stock and you provide your bank, broker, trust or\nother nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will be counted in determining the presence of a\nquorum. If you are a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares of Magellan common stock and you do not provide your\nbank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will not be counted in\ndetermining the presence of a quorum.\nAll shares of Magellan common stock held by stockholders that attend the special meeting via the virtual\nmeeting website, or are represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting, regardless of how such\nshares are voted or whether such stockholders have indicated on their proxy that they are abstaining from\nvoting, will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the special\nmeeting may be adjourned.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be\npaid or become payable to Magellan\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nMerger?\nA:\nIn July 2010, the SEC adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding advisory vote to approve\ncertain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or\notherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the Merger. In accordance with the rules promulgated under\nSection 14A of the Exchange Act, Magellan is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-\nbinding advisory vote on compensation that may be paid or become payable to Magellan\u2019s named executive\nofficers in connection with the Merger. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cProposal 2: Non-\nBinding Merger-Related Compensation Proposal,\u201d beginning on page 27.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if Magellan stockholders do not approve the non-binding Merger-related compensation\nproposal?\nA:\nThe vote to approve the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from\nthe vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Approval of the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal is\nnot a condition to completion of the Merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning that it will not be binding\non Magellan or Centene or any of their respective subsidiaries. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is\nadopted by Magellan\u2019s stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or\notherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to our named executive officers even if this proposal is not\napproved.\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the Annexes\nattached to this proxy statement, please vote your shares of Magellan common stock in one of the ways\ndescribed below as soon as possible. You will be entitled to one vote for each share of Magellan common stock\nthat you owned on the record date.\nQ:\nHow do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?\nA:\nYou may vote by:\n\u2022\nsubmitting your proxy by completing, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it\nby mail in the enclosed prepaid envelope\u037e\n\u2022\nsubmitting your proxy by using the telephone number printed on each proxy card you receive\u037e\n\u2022\nsubmitting your proxy through the internet voting instructions printed on each proxy card you\nreceive\u037e or\n\u2022\ncasting your vote at the special meeting via the virtual meeting website. Any stockholder can attend\nthe special meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MGLN2021SM, where\nstockholders will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote online. The special meeting starts at\n8:30 a.m., Central Time. We encourage you to allow ample time for online check-in, which will open at\n8:15 a.m., Central Time. Please have your 16-digit control number to join the special meeting.\nInstructions on who can attend and participate via internet, including how to demonstrate proof of\nstock ownership, are posted at www.proxyvote.com.\nIf you are submitting your proxy by telephone or through the internet, your voting instructions must be\nreceived by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on March 30, 2021.\nIf your shares of Magellan common stock are purchased through the Company ESPP and are held through your\naccount with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you must vote such shares by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on\nMarch 26, 2021.\nSubmitting your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet will not prevent you from casting your vote\nat the special meeting via the virtual meeting website. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by mail, by\ntelephone or through the internet even if you plan to attend the special meeting via the virtual meeting website\nto ensure that your shares of Magellan common stock are represented at the special meeting.\nIf you return your signed proxy card, but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares will\nbe voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the non-binding Merger-\nrelated compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting if\nnecessary or appropriate.\nQ:\nIf my shares are held for me by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, will my bank, broker, trust or other\nnominee vote those shares for me with respect to the proposals?\nA:\nYour bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT have the power to vote your shares of Magellan common\nstock at the special meeting unless you provide instructions to your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how\nto vote. You should instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote your shares with respect\nto the proposals, using the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. You may be able\nto vote by telephone or through the internet if your bank, broker, trust or other nominee offers these options.\nQ:\nWhat if I fail to instruct my bank, broker, trust or other nominee how to vote?\nA:\nYour bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be able to vote your shares of Magellan common stock\nunless you have properly instructed your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. Because the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of Magellan common stock, the failure to provide your nominee with voting instructions will\nhave the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, your\nshares of Magellan common stock will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares present at the\nspecial meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card or after I have submitted my proxy by telephone or\nthrough the internet?\nA:\nYes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the special meeting. You\nmay revoke your proxy by delivering a signed written notice of revocation stating that the proxy is revoked and\nbearing a date later than the date of the proxy delivered to David Haddock, Secretary, Magellan Health, Inc., 4801\nE. Washington Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85034. You may also revoke your proxy or change your vote by\nsubmitting another proxy by telephone or through the internet in accordance with the instructions on the\nenclosed proxy card. You may also submit a later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares. If you voted by\ncompleting, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card, you should retain a copy of the voter control\nnumber found on the proxy card in the event that you later decide to revoke your proxy or change your vote by\ntelephone or through the internet. Alternatively, your proxy may be revoked or changed by attending the special\nmeeting via the virtual meeting website and voting at the meeting. However, simply attending the special\nmeeting without voting will not revoke or change your proxy. \u201cStreet name\u201d holders of shares of Magellan\ncommon stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to obtain instructions as to how to\nrevoke or change their proxies.\nIf you have instructed a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to vote your shares of Magellan common stock,\nyou must follow the instructions received from your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to change your vote.\nAll properly submitted proxies received by us before the special meeting that are not revoked or changed prior\nto being exercised at the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions\nindicated on the proxies or, if no instructions were provided, \u201cFOR\u201d each of the proposals.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?\nA:\nIf you receive more than one proxy card, it means that you hold shares of Magellan common stock that are\nregistered in more than one account. For example, if you own your shares in various registered forms, such as\njointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and you will need to\nsign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record\nownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your shares of Magellan common stock are voted, you will need to\nsubmit your proxies by mailing in each proxy card you receive or by telephone or through the internet by using\nthe different voter control number(s) on each proxy card.\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of certain disclosure documents to any household at which two\nor more stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides\nadvance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate\nnotice of the meeting and proxy card. This householding process reduces the volume of duplicate information\nand reduces printing and mailing expenses. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of Magellan\ncommon stock, you may have already received a householding notification. For additional information, see the\nsection entitled \u201cHouseholding of Proxy Material,\u201d beginning on page 106.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Magellan common stock before the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of completion of the Merger. If you own\nshares of Magellan common stock as of the close of business on the record date but transfer your shares prior\nto the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but the right to receive the\nMerger Consideration will pass to the person who holds your shares as of immediately prior to the Effective\nTime.\nQ:\nMay I exercise dissenters\u2019 rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nYes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the\nDGCL. Under Delaware law, holders of record of shares of Magellan common stock who do not vote in favor of\nadopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed. Appraisal rights only will be\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\navailable to these holders if they deliver a written demand for an appraisal to Magellan prior to the vote on the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting and they comply with the procedures and\nrequirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal\namount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive\nunder the terms of the Merger Agreement. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex E to this\nproxy statement. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights,\u201d beginning on page 97.\nQ:\nIf I hold my shares of Magellan common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. Shortly after the Merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal that includes detailed written\ninstructions on how to return your stock certificates. You must return your stock certificates in accordance with\nsuch instructions in order to receive the Merger Consideration. PLEASE DO NOT SEND IN YOUR STOCK\nCERTIFICATE(S) NOW.\nQ:\nShould I send in my Company Options, Company PSUs, Company RSAs, Company Director RSAs, Company\nRSUs and Company PCU awards?\nA:\nNo. Shortly after the Merger is completed, your Company Options, Company PSUs, Company RSAs, Company\nDirector RSAs, Company RSUs and Company PCUs will be automatically exchanged.\nQ:\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\nA:\nWe and Centene are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. We currently anticipate that\nthe Merger will be completed during the second half of 2021, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions\nto the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived. The Merger cannot be completed until the\nconditions to closing are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived), including the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement by Magellan stockholders. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Conditions to the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 80.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is not approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding\nshares of Magellan common stock entitled to vote on the matter or if the Merger is not completed for any other\nreason, you will not receive any consideration from Centene or Merger Sub for your shares of Magellan common\nstock. Instead, Magellan will remain a public company, and Magellan common stock will continue to be\nregistered under the Exchange Act and listed and traded on the NASDAQ. We expect that our management will\noperate our business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that holders of shares of\nMagellan common stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are\ncurrently subject with respect to their ownership of Magellan common stock. Under certain circumstances, if the\nMerger is not completed, we may be obligated to pay Centene a termination fee. For additional information, see\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed,\u201d beginning on page 72.\nQ:\nAre there any requirements if I plan on attending the special meeting?\nA:\nThe special meeting will be held via live webcast only.

As a result, there\nwill not be any broker non-votes at the special meeting.\nAccordingly, if your shares of Magellan common stock are held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d a bank, broker, trust or other\nnominee will NOT be able to vote your shares, and your shares will not be counted in determining the presence of a\nquorum unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. Because the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of\nMagellan common stock, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will\nhave the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Because the approval of\neach of (1) the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal and (2) the proposal to adjourn the special\nmeeting if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the shares\npresent at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on\nsuch matter, and because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on\neither proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have no\neffect on approval of those proposals.\nHow to Vote\nStockholders have a choice of voting by proxy by completing a proxy card and mailing it in the prepaid envelope\nprovided, by calling a toll-free telephone number or through the internet. Please refer to your proxy card or the\ninformation forwarded by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to see which options are available to you. The\ntelephone and internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on March 30,\n2021.\nIf your shares of Magellan common stock are purchased through the Company ESPP and are held through your\naccount with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you must vote such shares by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on March\n26, 2021.\nIf you submit your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet voting procedures, but do not include \u201cFOR,\u201d\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d on a proposal to be voted, your shares will be voted in favor of that proposal. If you\nindicate \u201cABSTAIN\u201d on a proposal to be voted, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d that proposal. If\nyou wish to vote by proxy and your shares are held by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you must follow the\nvoting instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. Unless you give your bank, broker,\ntrust or other nominee instructions on how to vote your shares of Magellan common stock, your bank, broker, trust\nor other nominee will not be able to vote your shares on the proposals.\nIf you wish to vote by attending the special meeting via the virtual meeting website and your shares are held in the\nname of a bank, broker or other holder of record, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from the bank,\nbroker or other holder of record authorizing you to vote at the special meeting. Obtaining a legal proxy may take\nseveral days.\nIf you do not submit a proxy or otherwise vote your shares of Magellan common stock in any of the ways described\nabove, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have\nno effect on the approval of the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal or the approval of the proposal\nto adjourn the special meeting if necessary or appropriate.\nIf you have any questions about how to vote or direct a vote in respect of your shares of Magellan common stock,\nyou may contact our proxy solicitor, MacKenzie Partners, toll-free at (800) 322-2885 or collect at (212) 929-5500, or via\nemail at proxy@mackenziepartners.com.\nYOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. A letter of transmittal\nwith instructions for the surrender of certificates representing Converted Shares will be mailed to holders of record of\ncertificates representing Converted Shares if the Merger is completed.\n23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRevocation of Proxies",

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThe following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board, or the\nrepresentatives of each company, their respective advisors or any other persons.\nMagellan\u2019s senior management team and the Board regularly review and discuss Magellan\u2019s performance, prospects\nand strategies for future growth. These reviews have included evaluation of potential opportunities to strengthen\nMagellan\u2019s competitive position and enhance stockholder value through organic growth, acquisitions, investments\nand other transactions with participants in the managed care and broader healthcare industries.\nIn addition, over the past several years, the Board has considered other strategic alternatives as a means to enhance\nstockholder value. These alternatives have included the potential sale of all of Magellan or certain of its segments or\nbusinesses and the separation of the Company\u2019s healthcare segment (which we refer to as \u201cHealthcare\u201d) and\npharmacy management segment (which we refer to as \u201cPharmacy Management\u201d), in some cases together with a sale\nof one of the separated segments in so-called \u201cmorris trust\u201d or \u201creverse morris trust\u201d transactions. In this regard,\nprior to late 2018, Magellan had received a number of unsolicited indications of interest and preliminary proposals\nfrom private equity sponsors (which we refer to as \u201csponsors\u201d), on behalf of themselves and/or their portfolio\ncompanies, and corporate industry participants (which we refer to as \u201cstrategics\u201d), regarding extraordinary\ntransactions involving the entire Company or individual parts. In certain of these instances, Magellan engaged\nfinancial and legal advisors to assist it in assessing the third party\u2019s interest, had preliminary discussions with the\ninterested parties and, following the execution of confidentiality agreements, provided access to confidential\ninformation regarding Magellan. None of these approaches resulted in any definitive proposals with respect to a\ntransaction.\nOn December 13, 2018, Starboard Value LP (which we refer to as \u201cStarboard\u201d), a New York-based investment adviser,\nannounced in a Schedule 13D filing with the SEC that it was the beneficial owner of approximately 9.8% of the\noutstanding shares of Magellan common stock. In its filing, Starboard disclosed, among other things, its belief that\nthe shares of Magellan common stock were undervalued and represented an attractive investment opportunity.\nIn late 2018, Michael Neidorff, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Centene, contacted Barry Smith,\nthen the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Magellan, by telephone to indicate that Centene may be interested\nin exploring a potential acquisition of Magellan. Mr. Neidorff did not make a proposal but indicated that Centene\nintended to move quickly and would only need to conduct a limited due diligence review of Magellan before being in\na position to decide whether to make a proposal. In that regard, Mr. Neidorff asked that the Company enter into a\nconfidentiality agreement with Centene for the purpose of Magellan\u2019s furnishing limited non-public information to\nCentene. Mr. Neidorff also noted that Centene would be unwilling to be a participant in any organized sales process\nthat Magellan might determine to pursue.\nMr. Smith informed the Board of his conversation with Mr. Neidorff and Centene\u2019s potential interest at a meeting held\non December 29, 2018. Present at the meeting were representatives of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP (which we refer to\nas \u201cWeil\u201d), counsel to the Company, and Goldman Sachs, the financial advisor retained by the Company in\nconnection with Starboard\u2019s ownership position and Centene\u2019s potential interest in the Company. At\n29TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthis meeting, the Board determined to explore Centene\u2019s interest as a means of potentially maximizing value on behalf\nof the Company\u2019s stockholders and authorized the Company to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Centene in\norder to keep the parties\u2019 discussions confidential and to facilitate Centene\u2019s due diligence review.\nOn January 8, 2019, Magellan entered into a confidentiality agreement with Centene (which we refer to as the\n\u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d). The Confidentiality Agreement included a standstill provision but did not prohibit\nCentene from making confidential acquisition proposals to Magellan. Subsequent to the execution of the\nConfidentiality Agreement, Magellan furnished Centene certain non-public information regarding its businesses.\nAlso on January 8, 2019, the Board, together with the Company\u2019s legal and financial advisors, held a meeting and\nreviewed certain of the information to be made available to Centene. At that meeting, Mr. Smith reported on telephone\ncalls he had received from three other parties, each of which had separately expressed a potential interest in Magellan\nshould the Company determine to explore a possible sale or other extraordinary transaction, although none had\nprovided any specifics beyond these general statements of interest. Mr. Smith also discussed a follow-up call he had\nreceived from Mr. Neidorff during which Mr. Neidorff reiterated Centene\u2019s potential interest in exploring a potential\nacquisition of Magellan. Following these discussions, the Board authorized Goldman Sachs to contact Centene\u2019s\nfinancial advisor, as had been requested by Mr. Neidorff.\nOn March 3, 2019, the Board met, among other things, to continue its assessment of the possible interest of Centene\nand other parties and to determine next steps. At that meeting, Mr. Smith reported on his most recent discussions\nwith Mr. Neidorff. Mr. Smith noted that Mr. Neidorff had informed him that the current market price of Magellan\ncommon stock following the release of full year-2018 results was such that Centene would not be in a position to\noffer to pay a premium for the shares of Magellan common stock. Mr. Smith stated that he had told Mr. Neidorff that,\nif Centene nevertheless wished to submit an indication of its interest, it should do so. In response, Mr. Neidorff\nindicated to Mr. Smith that Centene would not do so at this time and instead would wait to see if the current market\nenvironment changed in the coming weeks.\nFollowing Mr. Smith\u2019s report on Centene, the Magellan directors engaged in a discussion with Weil and Goldman\nSachs concerning the process alternatives available to the Board to best explore potential transactions with those\nthird parties that had most recently expressed an interest in the Company, as well as with other potential buyers of all\nor parts of the Company. Following a discussion and consideration of the potential positives and negatives\nassociated with the various alternatives, the Board authorized and directed Goldman Sachs to conduct a broad\nconfidential outreach (which we refer to as the \u201cBroad Outreach\u201d) to strategics and sponsors potentially having an\ninterest in, and possessing the capabilities to execute on, a transaction involving all or part of the Company. In this\noutreach, the Board instructed Goldman Sachs to highlight its desire to maximize value for Magellan stockholders and\nto indicate that interested parties would be welcome to submit proposals for the whole Company or individual parts,\nincluding Healthcare and Pharmacy Management.\nOn March 4, 2019, Goldman Sachs commenced contacting third parties, including Centene and the three other parties\nthat had contacted Mr. Smith on an unsolicited basis. Centene informed Goldman Sachs that it was not interested in\nparticipating in the process. A total of 34 parties expressed potential interest in the Company, with 24 of those parties\nentering into confidentiality agreements with Magellan. Those confidentiality agreements, with certain exceptions,\nincluded standstill provisions that prohibited the third party from requesting waivers of the standstill restrictions.\nThe parties entering into confidentiality agreements with Magellan received certain materials regarding the Company\nand details concerning the process contemplated to be undertaken pursuant to the Broad Outreach and such parties\nwere requested to submit \u201cfirst round\u201d indications of interest on March 27, 2019.\nOn March 27, 2019, Magellan received indications of interest from nine parties. Of these nine parties, Magellan\ninvited eight to advance to the \u201csecond round\u201d of the Broad Outreach to complete due diligence, participate in\nmanagement presentations and formulate definitive proposals. Of the eight parties, four indicated an interest in\nacquiring the entire Company, two indicated an interest in acquiring Healthcare and two submitted indications\nregarding Pharmacy Management. One strategic, Molina Healthcare, Inc. (which we refer to as \u201cMolina\u201d), was not\nadvanced as its interest was limited only to the portion of the Company\u2019s Healthcare business that contracts with\nstate Medicaid agencies and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to manage care for beneficiaries under\nvarious Medicare programs (which we refer to as \u201cMagellan Complete Care\u201d or the Company\u2019s \u201cMCC Business\u201d).\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMolina was later invited back into the process to conduct detailed due diligence on the MCC Business. In addition,\nduring the second round of the Broad Outreach, Magellan received interest from four additional parties, one of which\nwas invited into the process in connection with its interest in Pharmacy Management.\nOn March 28, 2019, following the approval and authorization of the Board, Magellan announced that it had entered\ninto an agreement (which we refer to as the \u201cStarboard Agreement\u201d) with Starboard and certain of its affiliates.\nPursuant to the Starboard Agreement, among other things, Magellan agreed to (i) increase the size of the Board from\nnine directors to 13 directors, (ii) appoint to the Board four individuals (which we refer to as the \u201cAppointed\nDirectors\u201d) from the slate of candidates that Starboard had previously announced it would nominate for election as\ndirectors at the 2019 Annual Meeting to fill the resulting vacancies, (iii) nominate the Appointed Directors for\nelection as members of the Board at the Company\u2019s 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (which we refer to as the\n\u201c2019 Annual Meeting\u201d) and (iv) decrease the size of the Board from 13 to 10 directors effective immediately\nfollowing the election of directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting. In addition, Magellan agreed to form a strategic\ncommittee of the Board to review corporate strategy (which we refer to as the \u201cStrategic Committee\u201d) and to appoint\nto this committee Peter Feld and Steven Shulman, two of the Appointed Directors, as well as two incumbent directors\nto be determined by the Board. Subsequent to the entry into the Starboard Agreement, two of Magellan\u2019s incumbent\ndirectors determined not to stand for re-election at, and one other incumbent director determined to retire immediately\nafter, the 2019 Annual Meeting.\nIn connection with the second round of the Broad Outreach, Magellan opened a virtual dataroom to interested\nparties that remained open through June 2019, made management presentations, conducted due diligence question\nand answer sessions and prepared, made available and discussed draft transaction documents for each of the various\ntransactions that were under consideration.\nOn June 6, 2019, the date set for submission of second round proposals, Magellan received revised proposals from\nthree of the interested parties, with the rest of the participants declining to continue in the process. One proposal\nsubmitted by a sponsor (which we refer to as \u201cSponsor A\u201d) was to acquire the Company, and the other two were to\nacquire Pharmacy Management. Representatives of Sponsor A indicated to representatives of the Company\u2019s\nfinancial advisor that Sponsor A\u2019s proposal was conditioned on its ability to enter into a definitive agreement to sell\nPharmacy Management to one of the other two bidders at an acceptable minimum price. Subsequent to Magellan\u2019s\nreceipt of Sponsor A\u2019s proposal, it became evident to the Company that Sponsor A also envisioned entering into a\nreceipt of Sponsor A\u2019s proposal, it became evident to the Company that Sponsor A also envisioned entering into a\ndefinitive agreement with Molina to sell the MCC Business at or about the time it entered into a definitive merger\nagreement to acquire the Company. Following review by the Strategic Committee and the Board with the Company\u2019s\nlegal and financial advisors, it was determined that Sponsor A\u2019s proposal was an attractive and superior proposal and\nagreed to Sponsor A\u2019s request for a limited period of exclusivity (which would not preclude the Company from\nnegotiating and entering into agreements with the other two bidders for a sale of Pharmacy Management) to complete\nits due diligence and attempt to negotiate the multi-party transaction contemplated by its proposal.\nFollowing its receipt of Sponsor A\u2019s revised proposal through the end of July 2019, representatives of Magellan and\nits advisors spent extensive periods of time providing due diligence access and responses to questions to Sponsor A\nand its financing sources, the potential buyer of Pharmacy Management and Molina. During this time period, in\naddition to negotiations conducted directly by Sponsor A with the potential buyer of Pharmacy Management and\nMolina, Magellan and its advisors also spent considerable time and effort engaged in negotiations with Sponsor A, a\npotential buyer of Pharmacy Management and, to a lesser extent, Molina as the potential buyer of the MCC Business,\nin an attempt to facilitate an agreement on terms for the envisioned multi-party transaction. The Strategic Committee\nand the Board held multiple meetings during June and July 2019 to receive progress updates on the potential\ntransactions and to provide direction to Magellan\u2019s management and advisors. Notwithstanding these efforts, at a\nmeeting held on July 29, 2019, the Board determined to terminate negotiations with Sponsor A and the other\ninterested parties due to its low level of confidence that terms for the multi-party transaction would be agreed to by\nthe four parties and concerns that distraction of the Company\u2019s senior management team due to the extensive time\ncommitments required by the process could harm the continued operation of the Company\u2019s businesses.\nAlso at the July 29, 2019 Board meeting, Mr. Smith notified the directors that he intended to retire, but that he would\ncontinue to serve as the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board for a period required to ensure\na smooth transition. At that meeting, Steven Shulman was elected Chairman of the Board.\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 11, 2019, Sponsor A submitted an unsolicited revised proposal (which we refer to as the \u201cSeptember\n2019 proposal\u201d) to acquire the Company and asked that Magellan and its advisors re-engage for the purposes of\ncompleting the transaction. Sponsor A\u2019s proposal contemplated that it would enter into a definitive agreement for the\nsale of the MCC Business with Molina at the same time as it entered into a definitive merger agreement with the\nCompany. Unlike its previous proposal, the September 2019 proposal did not contemplate an agreement with a buyer\nof Pharmacy Management. Based in part on Sponsor A\u2019s assurances that few issues remained open between it and\nMolina and that it could complete the work necessary to execute and deliver definitive transaction documents and\narrange financing quickly, the Board authorized management and its advisors to re-engage with Sponsor A.\nIn September 2019, Magellan re-opened its virtual dataroom to Sponsor A, its financing sources and Molina and also\ndiscussed and negotiated open points with Sponsor A on the transaction documentation. On October 11, 2019,\nSponsor A submitted a revised proposal (which we refer to as the \u201cOctober 2019 proposal\u201d) to acquire Magellan.\nUnlike the September 2019 proposal, the October 2019 proposal was conditioned on a sale by Sponsor A of Pharmacy\nManagement to the party that had been negotiating in July 2019 with Sponsor A and the Company for the purchase\nof that business. The October 2019 proposal also reflected a price reduction from the September 2019 proposal, which\nSponsor A stated was a reflection of unfavorable conditions in the financing markets, changes in customer pipeline\nand additional tax liabilities due to the impact of the sales of the MCC Business and Pharmacy Management.\nFollowing a review of the October 2019 proposal by the Strategic Committee and the Board, it was determined that\nMagellan and its advisors would communicate to Sponsor A a minimum per share price that would be acceptable to\nthe Board and a deadline by which definitive transaction documents would need to be executed. On October 18, 2019,\na representative of Sponsor A informed Goldman Sachs that the financing terms available would not allow it to pay a\nprice that would be acceptable to the Board. Following this communication, Magellan terminated discussions with\nSponsor A.\nAt various times during the Broad Outreach, Sponsor A modified orally and in writing the prices at which it was\ninterested in acquiring the entire Company. At no point did Sponsor A indicate an interest in acquiring Magellan at a\nper share price in excess of $75.00, the maximum per share price offered by Sponsor A to Magellan during the parties\u2019\nnegotiations, and Sponsor A\u2019s final proposed per share offer price prior to the termination of discussions was less\nthan $75.00.\nOn October 31, 2019, Magellan issued a press release announcing the appointment of Kenneth Fasola as Chief\nExecutive Officer of the Company, effective November 14, 2019. In connection with Mr. Fasola\u2019s appointment, Barry\nSmith stepped down as a member of the Board and as the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, effective as of\nNovember 14, 2019. Following his appointment, at the direction of the Board, Mr. Fasola and the other members of the\nCompany\u2019s senior management team initiated a comprehensive portfolio analysis of the Company\u2019s businesses to\nevaluate the value proposition offered by each business and the brand and growth potential of the Company in each\nof the markets served by Magellan\u2019s businesses.\nIn late February 2020, following the receipt of unsolicited proposals from a number of interested parties, the Board\nauthorized Magellan\u2019s management team and a financial advisor engaged by the Company for this purpose to\ncommence a process to explore the potential for a sale of its MCC Business. In the Board\u2019s view, a sale of the MCC\nBusiness at an attractive price would eliminate the risks of execution of its profitability improvement initiatives\nregarding the MCC Business, provide the Company with additional financial flexibility and allow the Company\u2019s\nsenior management team to focus on the remaining businesses and improving the services provided to the customers\nof those businesses. Pursuant to this process, a number of parties (a) entered into amendments to the confidentiality\nagreements previously executed and delivered in connection with the Broad Outreach to extend the time periods\nduring which the standstill and non-solicitation and no-hire provisions contained therein would be in effect, (b) were\nprovided due diligence access and management presentations, (c) were provided with transaction documentation for\ntheir review and comment and (d) were asked to submit proposals to purchase the MCC Business, as well as to\nconsider commercial agreements with Pharmacy Management and the Behavioral and Specialty Health businesses of\nHealthcare. Following the conclusion of this process, on April 30, 2020, Magellan publicly announced that it had\nentered into a definitive agreement with Molina to sell the MCC Business to Molina for a purchase price of $850\nmillion, subject to certain adjustments (which we refer to as the \u201cMCC Business Sale Announcement\u201d and such sale,\nthe \u201cMCC Business Sale\u201d), as well as various binding letters of intent to enter into long-term commercial agreements,\nincluding new medical pharmacy and\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmusculoskeletal management services to be provided by Magellan to Molina members and Molina\u2019s retaining\nMagellan for behavioral health, pharmacy benefit management (which we refer to as \u201cPBM\u201d), radiology and\nmusculoskeletal management services in certain markets serviced by the MCC Business.\nOn May 15, 2020, following the MCC Business Sale Announcement, Mr. Neidorff contacted Mr. Fasola by phone and\nindicated an interest in discussing the Company\u2019s strategic plans following the completion of the MCC Business\nSale. Mr. Neidorff invited Mr. Fasola to meet in St. Louis, Missouri to continue this discussion. On May 19, 2020, in\nanticipation of the in-person meeting in St. Louis, Centene requested that the parties enter into an amendment to the\nConfidentiality Agreement and furnished a proposed draft of such an amendment to David Haddock, General\nCounsel and Secretary of Magellan. The draft amendment served to extend the duration of the standstill provisions\napplicable to Centene and the mutual non-solicitation and no-hire provisions and the overall term of the agreement.\nThe parties entered into the amendment prior to the in-person meeting, with effect as of May 19, 2020 (we refer to the\nConfidentiality Agreement, as so amended, as the \u201cAmended Confidentiality Agreement\u201d).\nMr. Fasola informed Mr. Shulman of Mr. Neidorff\u2019s outreach on their next regularly scheduled weekly call. From May\n15, 2020 until the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021, in addition to updates provided to the\nBoard as described herein, Mr. Fasola kept Mr. Shulman updated regularly on the status and activities related to\nCentene\u2019s interest in a potential transaction, including any conversations and meetings that Mr. Fasola had with Mr.\nNeidorff and other Centene representatives in which Mr. Shulman did not participate.\nOn May 21, 2020, Mr. Fasola, Mr. Neidorff and Jesse Hunter, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of\nCentene, met in St. Louis. During this meeting, Mr. Neidorff informed Mr. Fasola of Centene\u2019s renewed interest in\nexploring a potential acquisition of Magellan and explained the strategic rationale for Centene\u2019s interest. Mr. Neidorff\nalso commented that for regulatory and other reasons the closing of the MCC Business Sale would need to occur\nprior to an acquisition of the Company by Centene and that he would expect that certain members of the Company\u2019s\nsenior management team would continue in their positions with the Company following the transaction. Mr. Neidorff\nalso noted that Centene would not participate in any organized sale process that Magellan might pursue. Mr. Fasola\nexplained to Messrs. Neidorff and Hunter that while he would report Centene\u2019s interest to his Board, in his view the\ntiming was not right for a transformative transaction involving the Company in the near term and that such a\ntransaction presented challenges for Magellan for several reasons, including Magellan\u2019s unwillingness to take\nactions that could in any way negatively impact or delay the pending MCC Business Sale, the Company\u2019s focus on\nand the dedication of management-team time to the implementation of the Medi-Cal pharmacy benefit administration\ncontract awarded to the Company by the state of California in late 2019 (which we refer to as the \u201cMedi-Cal PBA\nAgreement\u201d) and the business-transformation initiatives that were underway and that were being carried out under\nMr. Fasola\u2019s direction. Subsequent to this meeting, Mr. Hunter provided Magellan representatives with a list of\ninformation and materials regarding Magellan that it wished to receive to facilitate its review of the desirability of a\ntransaction between the parties.\nFollowing the May 21 meeting, Mr. Neidorff telephoned Mr. Shulman to express Centene\u2019s interest in pursuing a\npotential acquisition of the Company.\nOn June 8, 2020, Mr. Neidorff requested another meeting with Mr. Fasola, as well as Messrs. Shulman and Haddock,\nto further discuss Centene\u2019s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company, which meeting was\nsubsequently scheduled for June 18, 2020.\nOn June 9, 2020, representatives of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (which we refer to as \u201cSkadden\u201d),\ncounsel to Centene, and Weil spoke by telephone. In this conversation, the Skadden representatives stated that their\nclient\u2019s strong preference was to explore the possibilities for a mutually beneficial transaction as promptly as possible\nand, if mutually acceptable terms could be agreed to, envisioned the execution by the parties of a merger agreement\nthat would provide for Centene\u2019s acquisition of Magellan conditioned, among other things, on the consummation of\nthe MCC Business Sale. The Skadden representatives and the Weil representative acknowledged that the terms of\nthe MCC Business Sale would need to be examined before it could be determined whether entry into such a merger\nagreement during the pendency of the MCC Business Sale would be consistent with Magellan\u2019s obligations under\nthe MCC Business Sale transaction documentation or could impact or delay the timing of the completion of such\ntransaction.\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 17, 2020, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board, Messrs. Fasola and Shulman reported on their\nconversations and meeting with Mr. Neidorff. The Board discussed Centene\u2019s expression of interest and it was the\nconsensus of the Board that management\u2019s primary focus should be on the completion of the MCC Business Sale\nand the implementation of the Medi-Cal PBA Agreement and the other business initiatives that were underway, but\nthat Messrs. Fasola and Shulman should continue to agree to meet and discuss Centene\u2019s interest with Mr. Neidorff\nand the other Centene representatives and provide Centene with limited due diligence materials to determine if\nCentene\u2019s interest was serious and at an attractive price level.\nOn June 18, 2020, Messrs. Fasola, Shulman and Haddock traveled to St. Louis to meet with Messrs. Neidorff and\nHunter and representatives of Skadden. The Centene representatives reiterated their interest in exploring Centene\u2019s\npossible acquisition of Magellan in as expeditious a manner as possible consistent with Magellan\u2019s obligations under\nthe transaction agreements for the MCC Business Sale. The Centene representatives also reiterated the strategic\nrationale for such a transaction, including broadening and deepening Centene\u2019s whole health capabilities and\nestablishing a leading behavioral health platform. The Magellan representatives reiterated their views as to why\nattempting to effect a transaction such as the one envisioned by Centene in the near term was less than optimal from\nMagellan\u2019s perspective, but the meeting participants agreed that their respective legal counsel would discuss the\nregulatory requirements and likely timing for the possible transaction as well as the potential impact of the execution\nand delivery of a definitive merger agreement on the pending MCC Business Sale. The Magellan representatives also\nagreed to provide Centene with certain non-public information regarding the Company to aid Centene\u2019s efforts in\ndetermining its interest in continuing to explore a potential transaction and arriving at a preliminary view on valuation\nof the Company. On June 19, 2020, following the in-person meeting in St. Louis, Mr. Fasola instructed Jon Rubin, then\nthe Chief Financial Officer of Magellan, to share with Centene certain high-level non-public information concerning\nMagellan and its prospects that had been previously requested by Centene.\nOn June 23, 2020, Mr. Fasola provided the Board with a written summary of the June 18 meeting in St. Louis and\nnoted his expectation that following delivery of certain information by Magellan, Centene would communicate, for the\nBoard\u2019s review and consideration, a preliminary price or range of prices at which it would consider the acquisition of\nthe Company.\nDuring the ensuing several weeks, representatives of Centene, with the assistance of Centene\u2019s financial advisors,\nAllen & Company LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, reviewed the limited non-public business and financial\ninformation that was provided by the Company. During this period, representatives of the parties\u2019 respective legal\nadvisors discussed the regulatory filings and consents that would be required in respect of an acquisition of\nMagellan by Centene, the likely timing thereof and the potential impact on the regulatory filings and consents needed\nto consummate the MCC Business Sale, as well as the potential impact of the execution of a definitive merger\nagreement between the parties on the MCC Business Sale. During these conversations, Weil informed Skadden that\nMagellan would not sign a definitive merger agreement with Centene prior to the consummation of the MCC\nBusiness Sale. On July 10, 2020, representatives of Magellan provided representatives of Centene with certain\npreliminary financial data.\nOn July 21, 2020, Messrs. Fasola and Rubin had a teleconference with Mr. Hunter and Jeff Schwaneke, Executive Vice\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, to discuss certain questions of the Centene representatives\nregarding the limited non-public information made available, including the Company\u2019s preliminary financial data.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s normal multi-year forecasting process, in Summer 2020, Magellan\u2019s management developed\nfinancial forecasts and unaudited prospective financial information relating to the Company for fiscal years through\n2024, which included a small contingency to account for unspecified risks (which we refer to as the \u201cRisk\nContingency\u201d), consistent with management\u2019s historical practice. Elements of this forecast were shared with the\nBoard at their regularly scheduled meeting on July 24, 2020. Later on July 24, 2020, Mr. Rubin provided certain\nadditional non-public information to representatives of Centene, including a five-year financial forecast (which\nfinancial forecasts we refer to as the \u201cJuly 2020 Forecasts\u201d in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Certain\nForecasts\u201d). The July 2020 Forecasts furnished to Centene were the same as those reviewed by the Board earlier in\nthe day, with the exception that the forecasts provided to Centene included two additional years and did not include\nthe Risk Contingency.\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 9, 2020, Mr. Neidorff called Mr. Fasola and informed him that Centene intended to submit an indication of\ninterest regarding a potential acquisition of Magellan at $86.00 per share (which we refer to as the \u201cpreliminary\nCentene proposal\u201d). Mr. Fasola also understood Mr. Neidorff to say that the preliminary Centene proposal would\ngive Magellan stockholders dollar-for-dollar \u201ccredit\u201d for the cash, net of transaction taxes and expenses and\nCompany indebtedness, resulting from the closing of the MCC Business Sale. Mr. Neidorff indicated that, if the price\nwas acceptable to the Board, Centene would expect a 30-day period of exclusivity to complete its due diligence\nreview and prepare and negotiate transaction documentation. Magellan estimated that the net cash proceeds from the\nMCC Business Sale would represent approximately $12.00 per share, which, when added to the $86.00 per share price\nindicated by Mr. Neidorff, resulted in Mr. Fasola\u2019s understanding that the implied total value offered by the\npreliminary Centene proposal was $98.00 per share. On the same day, Mr. Neidorff called Mr. Shulman and conveyed\nwhat Mr. Shulman understood to be the same information regarding Centene\u2019s indicated price and the additional\n\u201ccredit\u201d for the net cash from the MCC Business Sale. Also on August 9, 2020, at Mr. Fasola\u2019s request, Mr. Rubin\ncalled Mr. Hunter to confirm the Company\u2019s understanding of the verbal preliminary proposal, and Mr. Rubin\nunderstood Mr. Hunter to convey the same additional \u201ccredit\u201d concept for the net cash from the MCC Business Sale.\nOn August 14, 2020, a meeting of the Board was held to discuss Centene\u2019s verbal preliminary proposal, including the\nimplied total value of $98.00 per share, which represented a premium of approximately 29.2% above Magellan\u2019s\nclosing price of $75.83 on August 13, 2020. It was the consensus of the Board that the indicated value to be delivered\nto the Company\u2019s stockholders was sufficiently attractive to warrant continued engagement with Centene and the\nBoard authorized the Company\u2019s management to continue to conduct discussions and grant due diligence access to\nCentene.\nOn August 16, 2020, Mr. Fasola emailed Mr. Neidorff to inform him that on the basis of the preliminary Centene\nproposal, the Board was supportive of management\u2019s continuing to explore a possible transaction with Centene.\nIn late August 2020, the Company contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities regarding\ntheir availability to act as co-financial advisors to the Company in connection with a potential transaction with\nCentene. Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities commenced acting as co-financial advisors to the Company in\nconnection with the potential transaction shortly thereafter and Magellan formally confirmed the engagement of\nthese firms in separate agreements dated October 27, 2020. Prior to their respective engagements, each financial\nadvisor delivered to Magellan an executed disclosure letter regarding its relationships with Centene. For a summary\nof these relationships, see the sections entitled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d and \u201c-Opinion of\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC,\u201d beginning on pages 49 and 56, respectively.\nDuring late August and early-to-mid September 2020, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Hunter, together with representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s and Centene\u2019s respective advisors, held telephone calls and exchanged correspondence regarding the\nproposed timeline for Centene to conduct its due diligence review, formally present to Magellan a proposal regarding\nprice and the timeline to complete transaction documentation should the parties agree on price and other terms.\nDuring these discussions, Mr. Rubin and the Company\u2019s financial advisors reiterated that Magellan would not enter\ninto a definitive merger agreement prior to the closing of the MCC Business Sale.\nOn October 1, 2020, Mr. Fasola provided the Board with a written update on the status of the Company\u2019s engagement\nwith Centene and the due diligence process, noting that Centene had identified certain due diligence priorities as a\nprecondition to confirming its interest and views on price. Mr. Fasola stated that the Company was working with its\nlegal and financial advisors to evaluate each request and indicated that, notwithstanding Centene\u2019s position, the\nCompany would not provide certain competitively sensitive information prior to receipt of a satisfactory preliminary\nwritten proposal with respect to price.\nIn early-to-mid October, members of management of Magellan and Centene, at times together with representatives of\nthe Company\u2019s and Centene\u2019s respective advisors, held telephonic conferences at which the Magellan\nrepresentatives provided the Centene representatives with presentations regarding the Company\u2019s Behavioral\nHealth, Pharmacy Management and Specialty Health businesses. On October 12, 2020, Mr. Fasola met with Messrs.\nNeidorff and Hunter in St. Louis to discuss the Company\u2019s Behavioral Health business strategy.\nOn October 23, 2020, Mr. Neidorff called Mr. Fasola and stated that the Company would receive a written offer from\nCentene of $86.00 per share prior to the Company\u2019s Board meeting scheduled to take place on October 27, 2020. No\nother terms of Centene\u2019s offer were disclosed or discussed on this call. Mr. Fasola subsequently\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninformed Mr. Shulman and the Company\u2019s advisors of the anticipated written offer. On October 26, 2020, Centene sent\na letter addressed to Mr. Shulman setting forth preliminary, non-binding terms for Centene\u2019s acquisition of Magellan.\nThe October 26 letter (which we refer to as the \u201cOctober 26 proposal\u201d) confirmed Centene\u2019s previously communicated\nprice of $86.00 per share, comprised of $64.50 per share in cash and a fixed ratio of Centene stock. On October 23,\n2020, the last trading day prior to the Company\u2019s receipt of Centene\u2019s letter, the closing price of Magellan common\nstock was $78.50. The October 26 proposal implied a pro forma ownership for Magellan stockholders in Centene of\napproximately 1.5%. In addition, the October 26 proposal indicated, among other things, that (1) Centene believed\nthat it could obtain regulatory approvals for the transaction expeditiously, (2) the transaction would not be subject to\nany financing condition, (3) Centene is committed to building a differentiated specialty solutions business and\nlooked forward to discussing leadership opportunities with the Magellan team, (4) Centene\u2019s offer assumed a 30-day\nperiod of exclusivity to complete due diligence and negotiate definition documentation, (5) Centene would need to\nconduct additional due diligence prior to executing a definitive transaction agreement and (6) Centene would share a\ndraft of the merger agreement for the transaction promptly after Magellan\u2019s entry into the exclusivity agreement.\nCentene then sent representatives of Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities a draft exclusivity agreement (which\nwe refer to as the \u201cExclusivity Agreement\u201d).\nFollowing receipt of the October 26 proposal and consultation with Mr. Shulman and the Company\u2019s advisors on\nOctober 26, Mr. Fasola telephoned Mr. Neidorff to clarify the financial terms of the October 26 proposal, which varied\nfrom Mr. Fasola\u2019s understanding of the oral indication conveyed by Mr. Neidorff on August 9, 2020, in that it did not\ngive Magellan stockholders the additional \u201ccredit\u201d for the net cash resulting from the closing of the MCC Business\nSale. Mr. Neidorff stated that Centene\u2019s $86.00 per share indication of interest accounted for the net cash resulting\nfrom the MCC Business Sale and that the preliminary Centene proposal did not contemplate giving \u201ccredit\u201d of such\namount to Magellan stockholders. Mr. Fasola informed Mr. Neidorff that given this position, it was his view that the\nOctober 26 proposal would not be viewed as attractive by the Board.\nOn October 27, 2020, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, which was attended by certain members of\nMagellan management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and Weil. Mr. Fasola and Mr.\nShulman presented the terms of the October 26 proposal to the Board. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nGuggenheim Securities then delivered a presentation to the Board regarding general market and industry conditions\nand their respective preliminary financial analyses of the Company and the October 26 proposal. In connection with\nthe Board\u2019s consideration of the potential transaction, financial forecasts through 2024 that were consistent with the\nfinancial forecasts that had been reviewed with the Board on July 24, 2020, were presented to the Board (which\nfinancial forecasts we refer to as the \u201cOctober 2020 Forecasts\u201d in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-\nCertain Forecasts\u201d). The Board discussed with members of Magellan\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Guggenheim Securities certain strategic alternatives available to the Company, including continuing as a\nstandalone company and deployment of the net cash from the closing of the MCC Business Sale. Representatives of\nWeil reviewed certain terms and legal aspects of the October 26 proposal and discussed with the Board various legal\nmatters, including the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in considering the October 26 proposal and process considerations,\nincluding Centene\u2019s request for exclusivity. Following the advisors\u2019 presentations and discussion, the Board\ndetermined that the October 26 proposal was not attractive but that the parties should continue their dialogue to\ndetermine if Centene\u2019s offer could be improved. After discussion, the Board also was of the view that the Company\nwould not consider granting a period of exclusivity unless Mr. Neidorff indicated a higher price. In addition, the\nBoard determined that it would be premature for any member of management to have discussions with Centene\nconcerning possible post-transaction employment. The Board directed Messrs. Fasola and Shulman to respond to\nCentene accordingly.\nLater on October 27, 2020, Mr. Fasola spoke to Mr. Neidorff by telephone, during which Mr. Fasola reminded Mr.\nNeidorff of his understanding of the basis on which Magellan had agreed to provide Centene with access to\npreliminary non-public due diligence information, namely that Centene\u2019s proposal as to price would reflect a full\nmarket premium to Magellan\u2019s then-current market price and permit Magellan stockholders to receive the additional\n\u201ccredit\u201d for the net cash proceeds, after debt, from the MCC Business Sale and noted that the financial terms of the\nOctober 26 proposal were inconsistent with this understanding. Further, Mr. Fasola informed Mr. Neidorff that the\nBoard had expressed concerns regarding the risks to Magellan and the initiatives and business transformation that\nwere underway that could result from advancing discussions and distracting\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmanagement if discussions with Centene were unlikely to result in a price viewed as compelling by the Board. Mr.\nFasola informed Mr. Neidorff that the Board did not view the October 26 proposal as attractive. Mr. Neidorff asked\nMr. Fasola to offer a counter-proposal, but Mr. Fasola did not offer a counter-proposal on the call.\nOn October 29, 2020, Mr. Fasola and Mr. Hunter spoke by telephone. Mr. Fasola said that he and Mr. Shulman had\nreflected on Mr. Neidorff\u2019s request for a counter-proposal and, while he was not prepared to mention a specific price,\nhe informed Mr. Hunter that the sentiment of the Board was to view favorably an all-cash price of greater than $100.00\nper share. Mr. Fasola told Mr. Hunter that, if Centene submitted a revised proposal meeting this criteria, he believed\nthat the Board would view the proposal as attractive and grant Centene a brief period of exclusivity.\nOn October 30, 2020, Mr. Neidorff held a conference call with Messrs. Fasola and Shulman. During the call, Mr.\nNeidorff said that Magellan\u2019s price indication as conveyed to Mr. Hunter was well in excess of premia paid in relevant\nprecedent transactions. Mr. Neidorff told the Magellan representatives that Centene was increasing its proposal to\n$91.00 per share and said that such a price represented a 28% premium over Magellan\u2019s \u201cnet equity\u201d, meaning\nMagellan\u2019s closing per share price on October 30, 2020 less the net cash per share that would result from the MCC\nBusiness Sale. Mr. Neidorff noted that his proposal contemplated that the merger consideration would be comprised\nof a mix of cash and stock as previously communicated and that the cash proceeds of the MCC Business Sale would\nremain in the Company at the time of the acquisition by Centene.\nThe next day Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Shulman had a number of calls during which they discussed Centene\u2019s latest\nproposal. Mr. Shulman told Mr. Neidorff that be believed that applying the premia paid in the precedent transactions\nreferenced by Mr. Neidorff and the \u201cnet equity\u201d premium calculation cited by Mr. Neidorff would result in a price per\nshare greater than $91.00. Mr. Shulman also told Mr. Neidorff that he did not believe that the $91.00 per share\nproposal would gain the support of the Board. Mr. Neidorff indicated that, if Mr. Shulman believed his latest proposal\nwas not sufficiently attractive, then he should put forth a counter-proposal.\nOn November 1, 2020, following a discussion of Centene\u2019s $91.00 per share proposal with the Company\u2019s advisors,\nMessrs. Fasola and Shulman called Mr. Neidorff and proposed a per share price of $100.00 in cash. Mr. Neidorff told\nMessrs. Fasola and Shulman that in his view this price was a restatement of the lower end of the prior \u201crange\u201d\nproposed by Magellan and not a counter-proposal, in response to which Mr. Shulman made a revised counter-\nproposal of $99.00 per share in cash.\nTelephonic conference calls among Messrs. Neidorff, Fasola and Shulman ensued throughout the day on November\n1, 2020. Following Magellan\u2019s counter-proposal, Mr. Neidorff informed Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman that Centene\nwould increase its offer to $94.00 per share. Mr. Shulman responded that he continued to believe that the premium\nrepresented by Centene\u2019s increased price remained inconsistent with the premia for the precedent transactions and\nthe \u201cnet equity\u201d premium calculation previously cited by Mr. Neidorff and that he would consult with his financial\nadvisors to confirm the accuracy of this view. Shortly thereafter, after consulting with the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisors, Messrs. Fasola and Shulman resumed discussions with Mr. Neidorff, during which Mr. Neidorff informed\nMessrs. Fasola and Shulman that Centene\u2019s best and final offer was $95.00 per share in cash (which we refer to as the\n\u201cNovember 1 proposal\u201d). The November 1 proposal represented a premium of 31.5% to the closing share price of\n$72.27 on October 30, 2020 and a 26.2% premium over the volume-weighted average Magellan stock price for the 30\nfull consecutive trading days ending on such date. Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman noted that they would present the\nNovember 1 proposal to the Board for consideration.\nIn the evening of November 1, 2020, a meeting of the Board was convened, with members of management of Magellan\nand representatives of Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and Weil in attendance, to review the status of\ndiscussions with Centene. Messrs. Fasola and Shulman reported on their telephone calls with Mr. Neidorff and\ndescribed the process that resulted in Centene\u2019s November 1 proposal. The Company\u2019s financial advisors then\npresented preliminary financial analyses based on the October 2020 Forecasts and related to a potential transaction.\nThe Board discussed the financial merits of the November 1 proposal and determined that the November 1 proposal\nwas attractive in light of, among other things, the execution risks associated with the initiatives and business\ntransformation contemplated by the Company\u2019s business plan and potential uncertainties relating to developments in\nthe healthcare industry. In connection with Centene\u2019s request for a 30-day period of exclusivity, the Board considered\na number of relevant considerations, including the scope of the Broad Outreach, which included contact with\npotential strategic acquirors, and the results of that process, the\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmanagement distraction, leak and other risks associated with contacting third parties, including the possibility of\nlosing the opportunity to engage in a transaction with Centene given Mr. Neidorff\u2019s stated view that Centene would\nbe unwilling to participate in any process by Magellan to explore alternative transactions, the Board\u2019s belief,\nfollowing consultation with its financial advisors, that it was highly unlikely that any third party would be interested\nin acquiring Magellan at a price equal to or in excess of the November 1 proposal and the fact that Magellan would\nhave the ability to consider unsolicited proposals following the execution and announcement of a merger agreement\nwith Centene. In light of the foregoing, the Board directed Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman to inform Centene that based\non the terms of the November 1 proposal, the Company would be willing to enter into the requested period of\nexclusivity with Centene and proceed to negotiate the terms of a merger agreement and conclude the due diligence\nprocess.\nFollowing the Board meeting, Mr. Shulman telephoned Mr. Neidorff to report on the Board\u2019s determination. Mr.\nNeidorff subsequently called Mr. Fasola to continue discussions regarding the potential transaction.\nOn November 2, 2020, representatives of Weil sent representatives of Skadden a revised draft Exclusivity Agreement\nproviding for an initial exclusivity period of 14 days and an additional 14-day extension of exclusivity if, prior to the\nexpiration of the initial 14-day period, Centene confirmed in writing the substantial completion of its due diligence\nreview and that Centene continued to support a potential transaction at a per share price equal to or greater than\n$95.00. The revised draft also provided that exclusivity would terminate at such time as any representative of Centene\nindicated to any representative of the Company that Centene is no longer pursuing or interested in an acquisition of\nthe Company at a per share price equal to or greater than $95.00 and deleted the requirement that the Company notify\nCentene of any inquiry, proposal or offer that the Company might receive with respect to an alternative transaction.\nLater that day, representatives of Weil and Skadden had a teleconference regarding, among other matters, the term of\nthe exclusivity period, which Skadden stated was unacceptable to Centene.\nAlso on November 2, 2020, Mr. Hunter called Mr. Fasola to confirm receipt of Magellan\u2019s comments to the Exclusivity\nAgreement and said that Skadden would be sending Weil a revised draft reflecting a 30-day exclusivity period. Mr.\nHunter also alerted Mr. Fasola to the fact that Centene would be sending a list of confirmatory due diligence requests\nwithin 48 hours.\nOn November 3, 2020, the parties executed the Exclusivity Agreement, which provided for a 30-day exclusivity period\nthat would be automatically extended unless terminated by either party upon one business days\u2019 notice, provided\nthat the Exclusivity Agreement would be earlier terminated upon entry by the parties into a definitive transaction\nagreement or at such time as any Centene representative indicated to any Company representative that Centene is no\nlonger pursuing or interested in an acquisition of the Company at a per share price equal to or greater than $95.00.\nFollowing execution of the Exclusivity Agreement, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities\nengaged in discussions with Centene\u2019s financial advisors regarding the next stage of the process and related matters.\nOn November 5, 2020, representatives of Weil sent representatives of Skadden a draft clean room agreement (which\nwe refer to as the \u201cClean Room Agreement\u201d) to govern the exchange of, and implement procedures to protect, certain\ncompetitively sensitive information of the Company. From November 5, 2020 through November 7, 2020, Skadden and\nWeil exchanged multiple drafts of the Clean Room Agreement, which was executed with effect as of November 7,\n2020.\nOn November 12, 2020, Magellan provided Centene and its advisors with access to an electronic data room, including\na designated \u201cclean room\u201d pursuant to the Clean Room Agreement, containing certain non-public information\nregarding the Company.\nThroughout the remainder of November and until the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021,\nrepresentatives of Centene engaged in a due diligence review of the Company. In connection with Centene\u2019s due\ndiligence review, representatives of the Company, including members of the Company\u2019s senior management, and\nrepresentatives of the Company\u2019s financial and/or legal advisors, as applicable, participated in multiple due diligence\nand follow-up diligence calls with representatives of Centene during this period.\nAlso on November 12, 2020, due to Centene\u2019s belief that there had been delays in its receipt of certain requested due\ndiligence information, representatives of Skadden sent representatives of Weil a draft amendment to the\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExclusivity Agreement, which amendment proposed to extend the initial term of the exclusivity period until December\n31, 2020. The other terms of exclusivity, including automatic extension unless terminated by either party upon one\nbusiness days\u2019 notice, remained unchanged.\nOn November 17, 2020, Mr. Fasola reported to Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Hunter that, on November 13, 2020, the California\nDepartment of Health Care Services (which we refer to as \u201cDHCS\u201d) informed Magellan that DHCS intended to delay\nthe implementation of the Medi-Cal PBA Agreement from January 1, 2021 to April 1, 2021 in order to better leverage\nMagellan\u2019s workforce to bring to fruition certain aspects of the Medi-Cal PBA Agreement and to utilize such\nadditional time to conduct enhanced outreach and education, which delay was announced publicly by DHCS on\nNovember 16, 2020. Mr. Fasola noted in this communication that DHCS had reiterated its commitment to the\nrelationship with Magellan.\nOn November 18, 2020, Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Shulman spoke by telephone to discuss the terms of the exclusivity\narrangement between the parties. On this call, Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Shulman agreed to the extension of exclusivity in\nadditional one-week increments. In the evening of November 18, 2020, representatives of Skadden sent to\nrepresentatives of Weil a revised draft amendment to the Exclusivity Agreement, pursuant to which termination of\nexclusivity would require seven business days\u2019 notice from either party following the initial 30-day period. On\nNovember 19, 2020, the parties executed the amendment to the Exclusivity Agreement.\nOn November 20, 2020, Mr. Fasola met in-person with Mr. Neidorff and Sarah London, Senior Vice President,\nTechnology Innovation & Modernization of Centene, in Addison, Texas. In connection with Centene\u2019s anticipated\nexpansion of payor services following consummation of the potential acquisition, Ms. London addressed a number\nof matters with Mr. Fasola, including innovation and required technology, IT leadership, employee retention risk and\nareas of perceived business gaps and capital deployment to advance the strategy related to recent and pending\ninvestments.\nOn November 23, 2020, Skadden sent an initial draft of the Merger Agreement for the proposed transaction to Weil.\nFrom November 23, 2020 until the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021, the parties and their\nrespective legal advisors exchanged numerous drafts, and engaged in numerous discussions and negotiations\nconcerning the terms, of the Merger Agreement and certain ancillary documentation. During the course of these\nnegotiations, significant areas of discussion and negotiation involved (1) Centene\u2019s level of commitment to obtain\nregulatory approvals and Centene\u2019s ability to control the related approval process and strategy, (2) the outside date\nafter which either party could elect to terminate the Merger Agreement if the transaction had not been completed\nprior to such date, (3) the magnitude of the termination fee payable to Centene and the circumstances under which\nsuch fee would be payable, (4) the treatment of outstanding equity awards in connection with the transaction, (5) the\nobligations of the Company in connection with assisting Centene\u2019s efforts regarding the financing for the transaction\nand possible refinancing of its indebtedness and the impact thereof on the timing of the transaction, (6) the scope of\nthe representations, warranties and covenants, including the \u201cno shop\u201d provisions and the interim operating\nrestrictions on the Company, (7) the Company\u2019s ability to take certain actions with respect to employee compensation\nand benefits during the interim period and Centene\u2019s commitments to continuing employees of Magellan for a limited\nperiod of time following the transaction and (8) the definition of \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d.\nOn December 8, 2020, Mr. Haddock, another representative of Magellan and Christopher Koster, Senior Vice\nPresident, Secretary and General Counsel of Centene, as well as representatives of Weil and Skadden, participated in\na teleconference regarding the scope, process and anticipated timing of certain state regulatory filings required in\nconnection with the proposed transaction.\nAlso on December 8, 2020, and regularly thereafter until the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021,\nMr. Fasola and Mr. Hunter spoke by telephone regarding the progress of Centene\u2019s diligence efforts, areas of\nremaining review and any perceived impediments to progressing the potential transaction. Such conversations\ntypically addressed next steps for the respective parties.\nLastly, on December 8, 2020, representatives of Skadden sent to representatives of Weil a draft Merger Support\nAgreement proposed to be entered into by the Starboard Parties in connection with the proposed transaction in\nrespect of, among other things, the voting of the Starboard Parties\u2019 shares of Magellan common stock in favor of\nadoption of the Merger Agreement. On December 23, 2020, Magellan provided the draft Merger Support Agreement\nto Starboard.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 9, 2020, Mr. Fasola provided Mr. Shulman, members of Magellan management and the Company\u2019s legal\nand financial advisors with a written update regarding the anticipated timing of the closing of the MCC Business\nSale. Mr. Fasola reported that the consummation of the MCC Business Sale would occur on December 31, 2020. On\nthe same day, Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman updated Mr. Hunter and Mr. Neidorff, respectively, regarding the expected\nclosing date for the MCC Business Sale.\nOn December 10, 2020, the Board, with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs, Guggenheim Securities and Weil in attendance, held a meeting to discuss the potential transaction with\nCentene. Mr. Fasola first apprised the Board of the anticipated December 31, 2020 closing date for the MCC Business\nSale and, consequently, the targeted announcement of a proposed execution of the Merger Agreement with Centene\nduring the first week of January 2021. Mr. Fasola, together with the representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nGuggenheim Securities, provided an update on the status of negotiations, including ongoing conversations\nregarding regulatory approvals and the continued engagement and in-depth nature of Centene\u2019s diligence review.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities reviewed with the Board market conditions, the\nperformance of Magellan\u2019s share price since November 1, 2020, the date the Board authorized the execution of the\nExclusivity Agreement based upon the November 1 proposal, and the implied premia of the November 1 proposal of\n$95.00 per share to current trading and selected volume-weighted average prices of the Magellan stock. Based on the\nclosing share price of $79.81 on December 9, 2020, the November 1 proposal represented a 19% premium to the\ncurrent Magellan stock price and a 19.8% premium over the volume-weighted average Magellan stock price for the 30\nfull consecutive trading days ending on December 9, 2020. The Board engaged in a discussion concerning the\ntransaction price, concluding that Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman should address the topic of a per share price increase\nwith Centene when Centene was closer to completion of due diligence. Weil then provided the Board with an\noverview of the status of certain key terms under discussion in connection with the Merger Agreement, including the\nefforts that Centene would be required to use to obtain regulatory approvals for the transaction, the definition of\n\u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d, the \u201cmarketing period\u201d for Centene\u2019s transaction financing, the ability to extend the outside\ndate to close the transaction in connection with regulatory approvals, and the fees payable to Centene, and the size\nthereof, upon certain terminations of the Merger Agreement. Following these discussions, the Board determined that\nthe Company should continue to pursue a potential transaction with Centene to determine whether a transaction\ncould be finalized on acceptable terms.\nDuring the period from December 10, 2020 to December 22, 2020, Magellan and Centene, together with their\nrespective advisors, continued to progress the work necessary to reach agreement on and to enter into definitive\ntransaction documentation, including targeted diligence calls and preparation of revised Merger Agreement drafts,\nand discussions regarding certain provisions of the Merger Agreement.\nOn December 22, 2020, representatives of Weil and Skadden held a telephone call during which Skadden informed\nWeil that it was important to Centene that certain Magellan executives, including Mr. Fasola, enter into employment\nletter agreements with Centene in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nOn December 23, 2020, Mr. Fasola called each of Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Hunter to request an increased transaction\nprice, noting that Magellan\u2019s share price had increased during the period of due diligence and negotiation of\ndefinitive transactions agreements. Mr. Fasola emphasized that the Board was expecting an increase in the per share\ntransaction price to reflect such share price increase. Mr. Neidorff responded that such conversations were premature\nand that Centene and Magellan should discuss any change in price the following week.\nOn December 24, 2020, Mr. Shulman called Mr. Neidorff to reiterate the reasons conveyed by Mr. Fasola for an\nincrease in the transaction price, as well as the expectation of the Board that Centene would agree to such an\nincrease.\nAlso on December 24, 2020, Mr. Fasola provided a written update to the Board regarding the status of the potential\ntransaction. In his update, Mr. Fasola noted that Centene had asked Magellan to set a target date of January 4, 2021\nto announce the execution of a definitive agreement by the parties and that he and Mr. Shulman would continue\nnegotiations with Centene regarding a higher transaction price in order to present a revised offer to the Board for\nconsideration at the Board meeting scheduled for December 30, 2020. Mr. Fasola also outlined areas of risk or\nunderperformance that Centene had identified as reasons that an increased price proposal might not be warranted.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 26, 2020, representatives of Weil sent representatives of Skadden a draft of the Company\u2019s disclosure\nschedule to the Merger Agreement. From December 26, 2020 through the execution of the Merger Agreement on\nJanuary 4, 2021, Weil and Skadden exchanged multiple drafts of, and participated in several discussions regarding,\nthe Company\u2019s disclosure schedule and various exhibits to the Merger Agreement.\nOn December 29, 2020, Mr. Fasola, Mr. Hunter and Colin Toney, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Group Strategy of\nCentene, spoke regarding the status of Centene\u2019s due diligence review and remaining areas of inquiry. During this\nconversation, Mr. Hunter asked Mr. Fasola whether points of information remained outstanding from Centene in\nadvance of Magellan\u2019s Board meeting scheduled for December 30, 2020. Mr. Fasola stated again that Magellan had\nrequested, and was waiting for a response regarding, an increased offer price to reflect the recent increase in the\ntrading prices of the Magellan stock, which the Board would be focused on at the meeting.\nOn December 30, 2020, the Board held a meeting with members of management of Magellan and representatives of\nGoldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and Weil in attendance. Mr. Fasola reported to the Board on his\nconversations with Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Hunter regarding the request for a revised proposal reflecting an increased\ntransaction price. Mr. Fasola informed the directors that Centene had not submitted a revised proposal in response to\nsuch request. Mr. Fasola then shared an update regarding Centene\u2019s due diligence efforts and noted a limited number\nof outstanding high priority items. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities next reviewed with\nthe Board their respective updated preliminary financial analyses related to a transaction with Centene. Goldman\nSachs and Guggenheim Securities also discussed with the Board the likelihood of any potential alternative\ncounterparties interested in acquiring Magellan at a per share price in excess of $95.00. Weil then provided the Board\nwith a review of the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties and discussed certain key terms that were under discussion, including,\namong certain others, the size of the termination fee, the events that would trigger the requirement for the Company\nto pay the termination fee, Centene\u2019s request to receive reimbursement of its expenses upon a \u201cno vote\u201d by the\nMagellan stockholders and proposed restrictions on Centene\u2019s acquisition activity prior to consummation of the\ntransaction. In addition, Weil advised the Board that Centene had expressed a desire to negotiate offers of\nemployment with certain Magellan executives, but that to date no Magellan executives had been authorized to\ndiscuss future employment opportunities or terms with Centene. The Board, upon consideration and discussion of\nthe information presented and reviewed, authorized and requested Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman to continue to engage\nin negotiations with Mr. Neidorff regarding transaction price. The Board also advised that it would not authorize any\nmembers of management to engage in discussions with Centene regarding employment until an agreement on the\ntransaction price and other material terms for the transaction had been finalized.\nOn the morning of December 31, 2020, the MCC Business Sale was consummated. A representative of Weil advised a\nrepresentative of Skadden of this development later that day.\nThroughout the day on December 31, 2020, Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman had several discussions with Mr. Neidorff\nregarding transaction price. Mr. Neidorff informed Messrs. Fasola and Shulman that Centene would not increase its\n$95.00 per share proposal and that, to the contrary, Centene had been considering decreasing its offer price. In the\nafternoon on December 31, 2020, following the discussions with Mr. Neidorff, Mr. Fasola convened an unscheduled\nteleconference with several available Board members to provide an update on the discussions regarding transaction\nprice.\nAlso in the afternoon on December 31, 2020, Mr. Fasola spoke with Mr. Hunter to discuss his earlier conversations\nwith Mr. Neidorff, including Mr. Neidorff\u2019s suggestion that Centene was considering a proposal to decrease the\ntransaction price. Mr. Hunter called Mr. Fasola subsequently and reconfirmed Centene\u2019s interest in a proposed\nacquisition of Magellan at a transaction price of $95.00 per share. However, Mr. Hunter requested a prompt response\nfrom Magellan confirming its intention to continue pursuing a proposed transaction with Centene at such price in\norder to complete all open items in time for a January 4, 2021 announcement.\nIn the evening on January 1, 2021, a meeting of the Board was held, with members of management of Magellan and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and Weil in attendance, to provide an update regarding\nthe proposed transaction. Mr. Fasola reported to the Board that Centene had reaffirmed its best and final offer of\n$95.00 per share in cash, as set forth in the November 1 proposal. At the request of members of the Board, Mr. Fasola\nalso provided his view on Magellan\u2019s outlook in the near- and longer-term. The Board and representatives of\nGoldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities engaged in a discussion of the longer-term strategies and near-term risks\nthat might negatively impact Magellan\u2019s stock price. The Board reached consensus\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand unanimously authorized Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman to continue to finalize the documentation of a transaction\nbased on Centene\u2019s offer of $95.00 per share. The Board further directed Messrs. Fasola and Shulman, in connection\nwith affirming the Board\u2019s approval of the $95.00 offer price, to seek to obtain Centene\u2019s agreement with respect to\nthe open items in the Merger Agreement relating to (1) the reduction in the size of the termination fee that could be\ndue and owing to Centene under certain circumstances, (2) the deletion of a \u201cno vote\u201d expense reimbursement\nprovision in the event the Magellan stockholders fail to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (3)\ninclusion of a \u201cclear markets provision\u201d prohibiting Centene from entering into strategic transactions that would\nreasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the proposed transaction by the outside date.\nIn the morning on January 2, 2021, Mr. Fasola detailed in an email to Mr. Hunter the terms endorsed by the Board. Mr.\nShulman also contacted Mr. Neidorff regarding these terms. Messrs. Neidorff and Shulman subsequently agreed to a\ntermination fee in an amount equal to $76,530,000, or approximately 3% of the equity value of Magellan based on the\noffer price of $95.00 per share and the exclusion of the \u201cno vote\u201d expense reimbursement provision and inclusion of\nthe \u201cclear markets provision\u201d sought by Magellan.\nOn January 2, 2021, representatives of Skadden sent representatives of Weil a draft employment letter agreement for\nMr. Fasola (which we refer to as the \u201cFasola Letter Agreement\u201d), to be effective upon the consummation of the\npotential transaction. Weil forwarded the Fasola Letter Agreement draft to Mr. Fasola and his counsel and during the\nperiod from January 2, 2021 to January 4, 2021, Mr. Fasola and his counsel exchanged drafts of, and participated in\ndiscussions regarding, the Fasola Letter Agreement with representatives of Centene, including Mr. Neidorff, and\nSkadden.\nAlso on January 2, 2021, on behalf of the Starboard Parties and their counsel, representatives of Weil shared with\nrepresentatives of Skadden comments to the draft Merger Support Agreement. From January 2, 2021 through the\nexecution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021, Skadden and counsel to the Starboard Parties exchanged\ndrafts of the Merger Support Agreement.\nDuring the period from January 2, 2021 through the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021,\nrepresentatives of Magellan and Centene and their respective legal counsel, Weil and Skadden, continued to work to\nfinalize the definitive documentation for the potential transaction.\nIn the evening on January 3, 2021, a meeting of the Board was held for the purpose of consideration of the approval\nand adoption of the Merger Agreement with Centene. Representatives of Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and\nWeil, as well as members of management of Magellan, were in attendance. Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman provided the\nBoard with an update on discussions with Centene and the resolutions of the open issues in the Merger Agreement.\nAt the meeting, Mr. Shulman and Mr. Fasola reviewed with the Board the status of the Fasola Letter Agreement as\npresented by Centene and reported on certain modifications that were being sought by Mr. Fasola, which remained\nopen items in the negotiations. The Board discussed with Messrs. Shulman and Fasola these outstanding items and\nCentene\u2019s position that the terms of Mr. Fasola\u2019s Letter Agreement needed to be finalized and agreed to prior to\nCentene\u2019s execution of definitive agreements for the potential transaction. The Board discussed alternatives to\nproceeding with the transaction with Centene, including strategic plans for capital deployment if Magellan remained\nan independent company on a standalone basis. The Board then considered and expressed their views regarding the\nadvantages of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Goldman Sachs presented to the Board a financial\nanalysis with respect to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then rendered to the Board an\noral opinion, subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated as of January 4, 2021, to the effect that, as of the date\nof its written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its written opinion, the\n$95.00 per share of Magellan common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of\noutstanding shares of Magellan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such holders. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities then presented to the Board a financial analysis\nwith respect to the proposed transaction. A representative of Guggenheim Securities then rendered an oral opinion,\nwhich was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to the Board to the effect that, as of January 4, 2021 and based\nupon and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations\nof and qualifications to the review undertaken, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to\nthe holders of shares of Magellan common stock.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDuring the meeting, the Board was informed that the financial forecasts provided to Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim\nSecurities and approved by Magellan management for use in their financial analyses had been revised by\nmanagement from those last provided to Centene and previously discussed with the Board to take into account the\ndelay in implementation of the Medi-Cal PBA Agreement, significant scope reduction of an additional PBM contract\nand the non-renewal of another PBM contract (which financial forecasts we refer to as the \u201cJanuary 2021 Forecasts\u201d\nin the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Certain Forecasts\u201d), each of which had been disclosed to and\ndiscussed with Centene during its due diligence review. Following discussion, the Board unanimously approved and\ndeclared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the\nother transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and\nits stockholders, directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption\nand resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger Agreement. During the meeting,\nthe Board also voted to adopt an amendment to the Company\u2019s bylaws to provide that the Court of Chancery in the\nState of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for the adjudication of certain disputes involving Magellan and federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the adjudication of litigation arising\nunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nIn the early morning on January 4, 2021, each of Magellan, Centene and Merger Sub executed and delivered the\nMerger Agreement and Centene and the Starboard Parties executed and delivered the Merger Support Agreement.\nMagellan and Centene issued a joint press release announcing the proposed transaction and entry into the Merger\nAgreement.\nRecommendation of the Board",

        "Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement": {
            "text": "Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement\nAt a meeting held on January 3, 2021, the Board unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger\nAgreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Board\nunanimously recommends that the Magellan stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nIn arriving at this determination and recommendation, the Board reviewed and discussed a significant amount of\ninformation and consulted with Magellan\u2019s management, legal counsel and financial advisors. The following are some\nof the significant factors that were considered by the Board and supported its decision to approve the Merger\nAgreement and recommend that the Magellan stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement (not necessarily in order of\nrelative importance):\nMerger Consideration. The Board considered that the Merger Consideration represented:\n\u2022\na 14.7% premium over the per share closing price of Magellan\u2019s common stock on December 31, 2020, the\nlast trading day prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the \u201c12/31 closing\nprice\u201d)\u037e a 24.8% premium over what the Board considered to be the Company\u2019s per share \u201cnet equity\u201d on\nDecember 31, 2020, (i.e., the 12/31 closing price net of the estimated per share after-tax cash proceeds\nreceived in the MCC Business Sale), calculated by deducting from both the Merger Consideration and the\n12/31 closing price the estimated per share after-tax cash proceeds received in the MCC Business Sale\u037e and\nan 18.3% premium over the Company\u2019s volume-weighted average share price for the 30 full consecutive\ntrading days prior to the date of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n43TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe best and final offer of Centene, in the view of the Board and Magellan\u2019s financial advisors, and the\nhighest consideration payable to Magellan stockholders that was reasonably obtainable\u037e and\n\u2022\na price per share that, in the Board\u2019s view, was unlikely to be achieved on a standalone basis in the near\nfuture.\nProspects of Magellan.\n\u2022\nthe Board considered the possibility of continuing to operate Magellan as an independent entity and the\ndesirability and perceived risks of continuing to execute on its business plan, the potential benefits to\nMagellan stockholders of this alternative and the time horizon required for the business plan to yield\nimproved financial and market performance by the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board considered Magellan\u2019s standalone business plan, financial forecasts and the risks associated\nwith Magellan\u2019s ability to execute on and achieve such business plan and forecasts, including execution\nrisks associated with implementing planned-on initiatives across new partnerships and product\nintroductions, sales efforts and business transformations\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board considered the significant financial investments that would be required to execute on its\nbusiness plan, including the timing thereof\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board considered certain industry trends and the potential risks and volatility associated with these\ndevelopments, including larger pharmacy management companies increasing competition in the middle\nmarket, rebate and other regulatory developments leading to margin erosion and insourcing risk,\nparticularly in the behavioral health market\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Board also considered the fact that certain investments in and acquisitions of unaffiliated third parties\nwere contemplated as part of the business plan and in that regard considered the potential of limited\nopportunities on financially attractive terms.\nCash Consideration\u037e Certainty of Value. The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration is a fixed cash\namount providing Magellan stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the closing of the\nMerger, in comparison to the risks and uncertainty that would be inherent in remaining a standalone company or\npursuing a transaction in which all or a portion of the consideration would be payable in stock.\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs. The Board considered the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed in a\nwritten opinion dated as of January 4, 2021, to the effect that, as of the date of its written opinion, and based upon\nand subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its written opinion, the $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan\ncommon stock to be paid to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of the shares of Magellan common\nstock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d beginning on page 49 and Annex C to this\nproxy statement.\nOpinion of Guggenheim Securities. The Board considered the financial presentation and the opinion, dated as of\nJanuary 4, 2021, of Guggenheim Securities to the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the\ndate of the opinion, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of shares of Magellan common stock, which opinion\nwas based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various\nlimitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken as more fully described under the section entitled \u201c-Opinion\nof Guggenheim Securities, LLC\u201d beginning on page 56 and Annex D to this proxy statement.\n2019 Sales Process: The Board considered the Broad Outreach and related lengthy and broad sales process\nconducted by the Company that concluded in the fall of 2019 that resulted in only one potentially interested party\nindicating an interest in acquiring all of the Company, with such indication being at a per share price that was\nsubstantially below the Merger Consideration, and which process terminated due to the Company\u2019s inability to reach\nsatisfactory terms with any potential counterparty. For additional details, please see the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c-Background of the Merger.\u201d\nNegotiations with Centene and the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the general terms and conditions of\nthe Merger Agreement (which are described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u201d), including:\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe ability of the parties to consummate the Merger, including the fact that Centene\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s\nobligations to complete the Merger are not conditioned upon the receipt of financing\u037e\n\u2022\nthe significant commitment by Centene to obtain the HSR Act Clearance and the required consents and the\nbelief of the Board that the transaction does not present significant apparent regulatory concerns that\nwould impact the ability of the parties to complete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief of the Board that the outside date (as it may be extended under the Merger Agreement) provides\nthe parties with sufficient time to obtain the HSR Act Clearance and the required consents\u037e\n\u2022\nMagellan\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information and conduct negotiations with third\nparties regarding unsolicited alternative acquisitions proposals, including that, although standstill\nrestrictions under six confidentiality agreements entered into or amended in connection with the Broad\nOutreach and/or the exploration of the MCC Business Sale remained in effect in accordance with their terms\nfollowing the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, five of which standstill restrictions\nprohibited the making of confidential proposals to the Board, Magellan would be permitted to waive such\nstandstill restrictions in certain circumstances to the extent necessary to permit the counterparty to make a\nconfidential alternative acquisition proposal to the Board\u037e\n\u2022\nMagellan\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to change its recommendation that stockholders adopt the\nMerger Agreement in the event that the Company receives a superior proposal or certain other intervening\nevents occur\u037e\n\u2022\nMagellan\u2019s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, subject to\nCentene\u2019s ability to negotiate to match such superior proposal and subject to paying a termination fee of\n$76,530,000\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Board believed that the termination fee of $76,530,000 is reasonable (in part because of the\nBoard\u2019s belief that the amount of such termination fee is generally consistent with the amount of\ntermination fees in comparable transactions) and not preclusive of other offers\u037e\n\u2022\nMagellan\u2019s general entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the Merger Agreement is subject to the adoption by Magellan stockholders, which, in the Board\u2019s\nview, would allow sufficient time for a third party to make a superior proposal to acquire Magellan if it\ndesires to do so\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the Merger Agreement is subject to the adoption by the holders of a majority of the outstanding\nshares of Magellan common stock and the Board\u2019s belief that Magellan\u2019s directors and executive officers\ndo not own a significant enough interest in Magellan common stock, in the aggregate, to influence\nsubstantially the outcome of such vote\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s view that the Merger Agreement was the product of arms\u2019-length negotiation and contained\ncustomary terms and conditions.\nTiming of Completion. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement and the structure of the transaction as a Merger and concluded that the\nMerger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner. The Board also considered that the\npotential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the period during which Magellan\u2019s business\nwould be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.\nAvailability of Appraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights under Delaware law to\nMagellan\u2019s stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who otherwise\ncomply with all of the required procedures under Delaware law, which provides those eligible stockholders with an\nopportunity to have the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determine the fair value of their shares of\nMagellan common stock, which may be more than, less than or the same as the amount such stockholders would\nhave received under the Merger Agreement.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered certain risks and other potentially negative factors\nconcerning the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including:\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe fact that, following the Merger, Magellan will no longer exist as an independent public company and\nMagellan\u2019s existing stockholders will not participate in Magellan\u2019s or Centene\u2019s future earnings or growth\nor benefit from any synergies resulting from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Agreement precludes Magellan from soliciting alternative proposals\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, as a result of a failure to\nsatisfy certain conditions, including the approval by Magellan\u2019s stockholders and the condition requiring\nthe expiration or termination of the waiting period (or any extension thereof, including any agreement\nbetween a party and a governmental authority not to consummate the transaction before a certain date)\nunder the HSR Act and the making or receipt, respectively, of certain required regulatory filings and\nconsents\u037e\n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of Magellan\u2019s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which\nmay delay or prevent Magellan from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action\nthat it might otherwise take with respect to the operations of Magellan\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger Consideration will be taxable to Magellan\u2019s\nstockholders who are entitled to receive such consideration\u037e\n\u2022\nthe significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the Merger and the\nsubstantial time and effort of management required to complete the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, which may disrupt Magellan\u2019s business operations\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and contingencies related to the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement, including the impact on Magellan\u2019s employees and its relationships with\nexisting and prospective customers, suppliers and other third parties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe requirement that Magellan pay Centene a termination fee equal to $76,530,000 if the Merger Agreement\nis terminated under certain circumstances\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that, while the Merger is expected to be completed, there can be no assurance that all conditions to\nthe parties\u2019 obligations to complete the Merger will be satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the\nMerger may not be completed even if approved by Magellan\u2019s stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Magellan\u2019s directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different from,\nand in addition to, those of Magellan\u2019s stockholders (See \u201cThe Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe other risks described in and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in our\nannual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (as updated by subsequent\nquarterly reports on Form 10-Q) incorporated by reference herein and \u201cCautionary Information Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive,\nbut includes the material factors considered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in\nconnection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable\nto, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its\ndetermination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different\nfactors.

The Company\u2019s senior management does prepare certain internal multi-year financial forecasts,\nestimates and other financial and operating data relating to the Company on an annual basis, which are typically\npresented to the Board at the Company\u2019s regularly scheduled second quarter Board meeting.\nOn July 24, 2020, the Company provided to Centene financial forecasts for fiscal years 2020 through 2024 (we refer to\nsuch forecasts as the \u201cJuly 2020 Forecasts\u201d).\nAt a meeting of the Board held on October 27, 2020, in connection with the consideration of a potential transaction\nwith Centene, the July 2020 Forecasts, adjusted by the Company\u2019s management to include a small contingency to\naccount for unspecified risks that could adversely affect the achievement of certain financial results (we refer to such\nforecasts as the \u201cOctober 2020 Forecasts\u201d), were presented to the Board.\nIn late December 2020 and early January 2021, in connection with the Merger, the Company\u2019s management prepared\nrevisions to the October 2020 Forecasts to take into account the delay in implementation of the Medi-Cal PBA\nAgreement, significant scope reduction of an additional PBM contract and the non-renewal of another PBM contract,\neach of which development had been disclosed to and discussed with Centene during its due diligence review (we\nrefer to such forecasts as the \u201cJanuary 2021 Forecasts\u201d and, together with the July 2020 Forecasts and October 2020\nForecasts, the \u201cCompany Forecasts\u201d). The Company Forecasts exclude the MCC Business. The January 2021\nForecasts were reviewed by the Board during a meeting held on January 3, 2021. The Company\u2019s management\nbelieved that the January 2021 Forecasts appropriately reflected the known and potential impact of the occurrences\nincorporated therein. The January 2021 Forecasts were made available to the Board for use in its evaluation of the\nMerger and also were provided to Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities, which were directed by the\nCompany\u2019s management to use and rely only upon the January 2021 Forecasts for purposes of their financial\nanalyses and fairness opinions.\nNotwithstanding the fact that (i) the Board no longer believes certain assumptions underlying the July 2020\nForecasts and the October 2020 Forecasts reflect the Company\u2019s prospects due to the developments described\nabove, and did not rely on the July 2020 Forecasts or the October 2020 Forecasts in approving the Merger Agreement\nand (ii) at the direction of the Company\u2019s management, neither Goldman Sachs nor Guggenheim Securities, both of\nwhich received the July 2020 Forecasts and the October 2020 Forecasts, used or relied on the July 2020 Forecasts or\nthe October 2020 Forecasts for purposes of their respective financial analyses and fairness opinions, a summary of\nthe July 2020 Forecasts and October 2020 Forecasts are being included in this proxy statement only to give Magellan\nstockholders access to certain non-public information previously made available to the Board, Goldman Sachs,\nGuggenheim Securities and Centene, as and to the extent described above.\nThe following table presents a summary of the July 2020 Forecasts prepared by the Company\u2019s management as\ndescribed above:\n($ in millions)\n2020E\n2021E\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\nRevenue\n$4,565\n$4,962\n$5,408\n$5,753\n$6,160\nSegment Profit(1)\n$ 184.8\n$ 244.5\n$ 298.0\n$ 327.3\n$ 363.1\n(1)\nSegment Profit is a non-GAAP measure that the Company defines as profit or loss from operations, before stock compensation\nexpense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest and other income, changes in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration recorded in relation to acquisitions, gain on sale of assets, special charges or benefits, and income taxes.

The Company Forecasts were based on numerous variables, estimates and assumptions\nmade by Company management at the time prepared, including with respect to industry performance and competition,\ngeneral business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters\nspecific to the Company, including the factors listed under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d set forth in the Company\u2019s Annual Report\non Form 10-K (as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, all of\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwhich are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement), all of which are difficult to\npredict and many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control.

The Company has not updated and does not intend to update or otherwise revise\nthe Company Forecasts. There can be no assurance that the results reflected in the Company Forecasts will be\nrealized or that actual results will not materially vary from the Company Forecasts. In addition, the Company\nForecasts cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.\nTherefore, you should not place undue reliance on the Company Forecasts included in this proxy statement as\nnecessarily predictive of actual future events nor construed as financial guidance.\nMagellan stockholders are urged to review the Company\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a description of risk factors\nwith respect to the Company\u2019s business. You should read the sections entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional information regarding the risks inherent in forward-looking information\nsuch as the Company Forecasts and \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d.\nThe Company Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward complying with U.S. General Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d) (including because certain metrics are non-GAAP measures, and the\nforecasts contained therein do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP), the published\nguidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither the Company\u2019s\nindependent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or\nperformed any procedures with respect to the Company Forecasts, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other\nform of assurance on the Company Forecasts or the achievability of the results reflected in the Company Forecasts,\nand they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the Company Forecasts.

LLC\nAt a meeting of the Board, Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its\nwritten opinion dated January 4, 2021, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, and based\nupon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, the $95.00 in cash per\nshare of Magellan common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of the shares of\nMagellan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated January 4, 2021, which sets forth the assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in\nconnection with Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated herein\nby reference. The summary of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion set forth as Annex C.

In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Board that the January 2021 Forecasts were\nreasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of\nthe Company. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities\n(including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed\nthat all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger\nwould be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or Centene or on the expected benefits of the Merger\nin any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs assumed that the Merger would be consummated on the terms\nset forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which\nwould be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the\nMerger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the\nCompany\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to\nsolicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination\nwith, the Company or any other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of the shares of Magellan common stock,\nas of the date of its opinion, of the $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock to be paid to such holders\npursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs did not express any view on, and its opinion does not address,\nany other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or\ninstrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger,\nincluding the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any\nother class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or\nnature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or\nclass of such persons, in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan\ncommon stock to be paid to the holders (other than\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCentene and its affiliates) of the shares of Magellan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise.\nGoldman Sachs did not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Magellan common stock would\ntrade at any time or, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company,\nCentene or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or Centene or\nthe ability of the Company or Centene to pay their respective obligations when they would come due. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no\nresponsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events\noccurring after the date of the opinion. Goldman Sachs\u2019 advisory services and its opinion were provided for the\ninformation and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and such opinion does\nnot constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Magellan common stock should vote with respect\nto the Merger or any other matter. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to the Board in\nconnection with Goldman Sachs\u2019 rendering to the Board of the opinion described above. The following summary,\nhowever, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor\ndoes the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman\nSachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables\nmust be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019\nfinancial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on\nmarket data, is based on market data as it existed on or before December 31, 2020, the last completed trading day\nbefore public announcement of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nImplied Premia and Multiples\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied premia and implied multiples described below based on the\n$95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of\nthe shares of Magellan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement:\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock\nrelative to:\n\u2022\n$82.84, the closing price of shares of Magellan common stock on December 31, 2020, the last completed\ntrading day before Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion (which we refer to as the \u201cCurrent Price\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$87.52, the highest closing trading price of shares of Magellan common stock over the 52-week period\nended December 31, 2020 (which we refer to as the \u201c52-Week High\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$80.29, the volume weighted average price (which we refer to as \u201cVWAP\u201d) of shares of Magellan common\nstock over the 30-trading-day period ended December 31, 2020 (which we refer to as the \u201c30-Day VWAP\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$79.42, the VWAP of the shares of Magellan common stock over the 60-trading-day period ended December\n31, 2020 (which we refer to as the \u201c60-Day VWAP\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\n$77.91, the VWAP of the shares of Magellan common stock over the 90-trading-day period ended December\n31, 2020 (which we refer to as the \u201c90-Day VWAP\u201d).\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe results of these calculations and comparisons are as follows:\nImplied\nPremium \nRepresented by\nthe \n$95.00 in cash\nper \nShare of\nMagellan \ncommon stock\nReference Price Per Share of Common Stock:\nDecember 31, 2020 Closing Price of $82.84\n14.7%\n52-Week High of $87.52\n8.5%\n30-Day VWAP of $80.29\n18.3%\n60-Day VWAP of $79.42\n19.6%\n90-Day VWAP of $77.91\n21.9%\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs calculated an implied equity value of the Company by multiplying the $95.00 in cash per\nshare of Company common stock by the total number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock outstanding\nas of December 28, 2020, calculated using information provided by the Company\u2019s management and the treasury\nstock method. Goldman Sachs then calculated an implied enterprise value of the Company by adding to the implied\nequity value it had calculated the Company\u2019s net debt (defined for this purpose as the Company\u2019s debt as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, as reflected in the Company\u2019s publicly available filings, less the Company\u2019s unrestricted cash and\nshort term investments balance as of September 30, 2020, as reflected in the Company\u2019s publicly available filings,\nadjusted to include $932 million of net proceeds from the MCC Business Sale, $67 million of collections in November\n2020 stemming from the Company\u2019s wind down of the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan and to exclude $91\nmillion in investments made by the Company in December 2020 and $32 million and $25 million of Medicare Part D\nprescription drug plan collections to be received by the Company in 2021 and 2022, respectively, as provided by\nCompany management).\nUsing the foregoing, Goldman Sachs calculated the following multiples:\n\u2022\nThe implied enterprise value for the Company as a multiple of the estimated earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization (which we refer to as \u201cEBITDA\u201d) of the Company for calendar years 2021 and\n2022, as reflected in the January 2021 Forecasts.\n\u2022\nThe $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock as a multiple of estimated earnings per share\n(which we refer to as \u201cEPS\u201d) of the Company for calendar years 2021 and 2022, as reflected in the January\n2021 Forecasts.\nThe results of these calculations and comparisons are as follows:\nMultiples\nImplied Enterprise Value as a Multiple of: \n2021E EBITDA\n11.1x\n2022E EBITDA\n9.1x\nMultiples\nImplied Price as a Multiple of: \n2021E EPS\n33.5x\n2022E EPS\n24.2x\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nUsing the January 2021 Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the\nCompany to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Magellan common stock.\nUsing discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 8.0%, reflecting estimates of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of\ncapital, Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for the Company, by discounting to present\nvalue as of September 30, 2020, (a) the estimates of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by the Company for\nthe period from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2024, as reflected in the January 2021 Forecasts, and (b) a range of\nillustrative terminal values for the Company, calculated by applying a range of terminal year EBITDA exit multiples of\n6.5x to 8x to the Company\u2019s estimated terminal year EBITDA as reflected in the\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nJanuary 2021 Forecasts (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from negative 0.6% to 1.7%).\nGoldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain\ncompany-specific inputs, including the company\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt,\nfuture applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United\nStates financial markets generally. The range of terminal year EBITDA exit multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs\nutilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account historical next twelve months (which we refer\nto as \u201cNTM\u201d) enterprise value/EBITDA multiples for the Company over the past five years. For purposes of this\nanalysis, Goldman Sachs used a mid-year discounting convention, except that Goldman Sachs used end of year\ndiscounting for the net proceeds from the MCC Business Sale and collections in November 2020 stemming from the\nCompany\u2019s wind down of its Medicare Part D prescription drug plan and the impact of the investments made by the\nCompany in December 2020.\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding the ranges of present\nvalues it calculated for the unlevered free cash flow and illustrative terminal values, as described above. Goldman\nSachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it had derived the Company\u2019s net debt as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 (defined for this purpose as the Company\u2019s debt as of September 30, 2020, as reflected in the\nCompany\u2019s publicly available filings, less the Company\u2019s unrestricted cash and short term investments balance as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, as reflected in the Company\u2019s publicly available filings), to derive a range of illustrative equity\nvalues for the Company. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values by the implied total\nnumber of fully diluted shares of Magellan common stock as of December 28, 2020, based on the derived range of\nillustrative equity values, and calculated using information provided by Company management and the treasury\nstock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Magellan common stock of $85.55 to\n$100.89.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nGoldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of\nMagellan common stock, based on theoretical future prices calculated by Goldman Sachs for the shares of common\nstock.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share for the shares of Magellan common stock as of\nJanuary 1 of each of 2022, 2023 and 2024 by applying illustrative NTM P/E multiples ranging from 16.0x to 24.0x to\nestimates of the EPS of the Company for each of 2022, 2023 and 2024 as reflected in the January 2021 Forecasts and\nassuming, per Company management, that the net proceeds from the MCC Business Sale would be used to repay\ndebt at maturity. By applying a discount rate of 8.5%, reflecting an estimate of the Company\u2019s cost of equity, Goldman\nSachs discounted to present value, as of September 30, 2020, the theoretical future values per share it derived for\neach applicable year, to yield present values per share of Magellan common stock ranging from $56.61 to $98.30.\nThe illustrative NTM P/E multiples used in the foregoing analysis were derived by Goldman Sachs using its\nprofessional judgement and experience, taking into account historical NTM P/E multiples for the Company over the\npast five years. Goldman Sachs derived the discount rate used in the foregoing analysis by application of the capital\nasset pricing model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as\ncertain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.\nPremia Paid Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available data obtained from Thomson and DataStream, the\npremia paid in acquisitions of publicly traded healthcare companies (excluding biotech companies) in the United\nStates (which we refer to as \u201cHealthcare Acquisitions\u201d) announced during the period from December 31, 2010\nthrough December 31, 2020 in which the target company had an implied enterprise value of $1 billion to $5 billion. For\neach calendar year through December 31, 2020, Goldman Sachs calculated the premia of the price paid in all\nHealthcare Acquisitions announced during such period as well as in any all-cash Healthcare Acquisitions\nannounced during such period, in each case, relative to the target company\u2019s closing share price at the 1-trading day\nprior to the announcement of the transaction. For the entire period from December 31, 2010 through December 31,\n2020, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, mean, 25th percentile and 75th percentile\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npremia of the price paid in all Healthcare Acquisitions announced during such period as well as in any all-cash Health\nAcquisitions announced during such period, in each case, relative to the target company\u2019s closing share price at the\n1-trading day prior to the original announcement of the transaction. The following shows a summary of the results of\nthe review:\nPremium to \n1-Trading\nDay\nEntire Period - All Deals\nMedian\n29.2%\nMean\n35.2%\n25th Quartile\n15.4%\n75th Quartile\n55.4%\nEntire Period - All-Cash Deals Only\nMedian\n29.7%\nMean\n36.0%\n25th Quartile\n17.7%\n75th Quartile\n58.2%\nBased on its review of the foregoing data and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a\nreference range of illustrative premia of 15%-60% (based on the average premia paid in the 25th percentile and 75th\npercentile of Healthcare Acquisitions announced in the entire period relative to the target company\u2019s share price over\nthe 1-trading day prior to the original announcement of the transaction) to the Current Price. This analysis resulted in\na range of implied values per share of Magellan common stock of $95.27 to $132.54.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis\nGoldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to certain acquisition transactions announced\nsince November 1, 2006 involving target companies in the behavioral health and pharmacy benefit management\nindustry with a transaction value greater than $1 billion.\nWhile none of the target companies in the selected transactions are directly comparable to the Company and none of\nthe selected transactions are directly comparable to the proposed transaction, the target companies in the selected\ntransactions are companies with certain operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to\ncertain operations of the Company.\nUsing publicly available information, for each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated the implied\nenterprise value of the applicable target company based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction, as a\nmultiple of the target company\u2019s estimated EBITDA for the twelve month period ended prior to announcement of\neach applicable transaction (which we refer to as \u201cLTM EBITDA\u201d), as disclosed in public company filings and other\npublicly available information. The selected transactions and the implied enterprise value to LTM EBITDA multiples\ncalculated for the transactions are set forth below.\nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nEnterprise\nValue / \nLTM EBITDA\nDec-18\nCenterbridge Partners\nCivitas Solutions, Inc.\n8.7x\nMar-18\nCigna Corporation\nExpress Scripts Holding Company\n9.0x\nOct-17\nExpress Scripts Holding Company\neviCore healthcare\n13.1x\nMar-15\nOptumRx\nCatamaran Corporation\n17.1x\nOct-14\nAcadia Healthcare Company, Inc.\nCRC Health Group, Inc.\n10.2x\nJul-11\nExpress Scripts Holding Company\nMedco Health Solutions, Inc.\n11.5x\nMay-10\nUniversal Health Services, Inc.\nPsychiatric Solutions, Inc.\n9.5x\nApr-09\nExpress Scripts Holding Company\nWellPoint NextRx\n11.7x\nNov-06\nCVS Health Corporation\nCaremark Rx, Inc.\n13.3x\nBased on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs\u2019 analyses of the various transactions and its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of enterprise value to LTM EBITDA\nmultiples of 9.5x to 13.5x (representing the 25th and 75th quartiles of the implied enterprise value to\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLTM EBITDA multiples calculated for the transactions as described above) to the Company\u2019s estimated EBITDA for\nthe Company\u2019s fiscal year 2020 (excluding, at the direction of the Company\u2019s management, the net proceeds from the\nMCC Business Sale), as reflected in the January 2021 Forecasts, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for the\nCompany. Goldman Sachs subtracted from this range of implied enterprise values the Company\u2019s net debt as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 (defined for this purpose as the Company\u2019s debt as of September 30, 2020, as reflected in the\nCompany\u2019s publicly available filings, less the Company\u2019s unrestricted cash and short term investments balance as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, as reflected in the Company\u2019s publicly available filings), and divided the result by the implied\ntotal number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock outstanding as of December 28, 2020, based on the\nderived range of illustrative equity values, and calculated using information provided by management and the\ntreasury stock method, to derive a range of implied values per share of Company common stock of $59.80 to $79.09.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or\nsummary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the\nanalyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In\narriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to\nfairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.\nNo company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or\nCentene or the Merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Board as to the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of the shares of Magellan common stock,\nas of the date of the opinion, of the $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock to be paid to such holders\npursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect\nthe prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon projections of future results\nare not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon\nnumerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company,\nCentene, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from\nthose forecast.\nThe consideration of $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock was determined through arm\u2019s-length\nnegotiations between the Company and Centene and was approved by the Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to\nthe Board during the Company\u2019s negotiations with Centene in connection with the Merger Agreement. Goldman\nSachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or that any specific\namount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the\nBoard in making its determination to approve the Merger. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the delivery of its fairness opinion to the\nBoard and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, attached as Annex C to\nthis proxy statement.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and\ntrading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various\npersons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in\nwhich they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold\nor vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit\ndefault swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Centene, any of their respective affiliates and third\nparties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the Merger. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial\nadvisor to the Company in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Merger.\nGoldman Sachs expects to receive fees for its services in connection with the Merger, all of which are contingent\nupon consummation of the Merger, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of Goldman Sachs\u2019 expenses\narising, and indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities that may arise, out of its engagement. Goldman Sachs\nhas provided certain financial advisory and/or\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nunderwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which its Investment Banking Division\nhas received, and may receive, compensation. During the two year period ended January 4, 2021, Goldman Sachs has\nrecognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking\nDivision to the Company and/or its affiliates of approximately $100,000. During the two year period ended January 4,\n2021, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by Centene or its affiliates to\nprovide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. Goldman\nSachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Centene and\ntheir respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division may receive compensation.\nThe Company selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment\nbanking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to an engagement letter\nbetween the Company and Goldman Sachs, dated January 10, 2017 (as reinstated and amended pursuant to a\nreinstatement of engagement letter, dated October 27, 2020), the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its\nfinancial advisors in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter provides for a transaction fee that is\nestimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $13 million, all of\nwhich is contingent upon completion of the Merger. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs\nfor certain of its expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs\nand related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nOpinion of Guggenheim Securities, LLC",

Analyses\nThis \u201cSummary of Financial Analyses\u201d presents a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by\nGuggenheim Securities and presented to the Board in connection with Guggenheim Securities\u2019 rendering of its\nopinion. Such presentation to the Board was supplemented by Guggenheim Securities\u2019 oral discussion, the nature\nand substance of which may not be fully described herein.\nSome of the financial analyses summarized below include summary data and information presented in tabular format.\nIn order to understand fully such financial analyses, the summary data and tables must be read together with the full\ntext of the summary. Considering the summary data and tables alone could create a misleading or incomplete view of\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 financial analyses.\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to\nthe most appropriate and relevant financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular\ncircumstances involved. A fairness opinion therefore is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary\ndescription, and taking portions of the financial analyses set forth below, without considering such analyses as a\nwhole, would in Guggenheim Securities\u2019 view create an incomplete and misleading picture of the processes\nunderlying the financial analyses considered in rendering Guggenheim Securities\u2019 opinion.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities:\n\u2022\nbased its financial analyses on various assumptions, including assumptions concerning general economic,\nbusiness and capital markets conditions and industry-specific and company-specific factors, all of which\nare beyond the control of the Company, Centene and Guggenheim Securities\u037e\n\u2022\ndid not form a view or opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor, whether positive or negative,\nconsidered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion\u037e\n\u2022\nconsidered the results of all of its financial analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any one\nanalysis or factor\u037e and\n\u2022\nultimately arrived at its opinion based on the results of all of its financial analyses assessed as a whole and\nbelieves that the totality of the factors considered and the various financial analyses performed by\nGuggenheim Securities in connection with its opinion operated collectively to support its determination as\nto the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of such opinion, of the Merger\nConsideration to the holders of shares of Magellan common stock to the extent expressly specified in such\nopinion.\nWith respect to the financial analyses performed by Guggenheim Securities in connection with rendering its opinion:\n\u2022\nSuch financial analyses, particularly those based on estimates and projections, are not necessarily\nindicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by these analyses.\n\u2022\nNone of the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions used in the selected precedent merger\nand acquisition transactions analysis described below is identical or directly comparable to the Merger, and\nnone of the selected publicly traded companies used in the selected publicly traded companies analysis\ndescribed below is identical or directly comparable to the Company or Centene. However, such companies\nand transactions were selected by Guggenheim Securities, among other reasons, because they represented\npublicly traded companies or involved target companies which may be considered broadly similar, for\npurposes of Guggenheim Securities\u2019 financial analyses, to the Company and Centene based on\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 familiarity with the healthcare industry.\n\u2022\nIn any event, selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis and selected publicly traded\ncompanies analysis are not mathematical. Rather, such analyses involve complex considerations and\njudgments concerning the differences in business, operating, financial and capital markets-related\ncharacteristics and other factors regarding the selected publicly traded companies to which the Company\nand Centene were compared and the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions to which the\nMerger was compared.\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nSuch financial analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which any securities may\ntrade at the present time or at any time in the future.\nCertain Definitions\nThroughout this \u201cSummary of Financial Analyses,\u201d the following defined terms are used in connection with\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 various financial analyses:\n\u2022\nCY: means calendar year.\n\u2022\nEBITDA: means the relevant company\u2019s operating earnings (after deduction of stock-based compensation)\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\u2022\nEnterprise value: represents the relevant company\u2019s net equity value (as defined below) plus (i) the\nprincipal or face amount of total debt and (ii) the book value of any non-controlling/minority interests less\n(iii) cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term marketable investments and certain other cash-like items\nand (iv) the book value of any non-consolidated investments.\n\u2022\nEPS: means the relevant company\u2019s earnings per share.\n\u2022\nNet equity value: represents the relevant company\u2019s (i) gross equity value as calculated (a) based on\noutstanding common shares, restricted stock units and performance stock units (in each of the foregoing\ncases, as applicable) plus shares issuable upon the conversion or exercise of all in-the-money convertible\nsecurities, stock options and/or stock warrants times (b) the relevant company\u2019s stock price less (ii) the\ncash proceeds from the assumed exercise of all in-the-money stock options and stock warrants.\n\u2022\nNTM: means next twelve months.\n\u2022\nUnlevered free cash flow: means the relevant company\u2019s after-tax unlevered operating cash flow (after\ndeduction of stock-based compensation) minus capital expenditures and changes in working capital.\n\u2022\nVWAP: means volume-weighted average share price over the indicated period of time.\nRecap of Implied Merger Financial Metrics\nBased on the Merger Consideration, Guggenheim Securities calculated various Merger-implied premia and multiples\nas outlined in the table below:\nMerger-Implied Premia and Merger-Implied Multiples\nMerger Consideration\n$95.00\nCompany\nStock \nPrice\nAcquisition Premium/(Discount) Relative to the Company\u2019s:\nUnaffected Stock Price @ 12/31/20\n$82.84\n14.7%\n52-Week High\n87.52\n8.5\nUnaffected VWAPs @ 12/31/20:\n30-Day\n80.29\n18.3\n60-Day\n79.42\n19.6\n90-Day\n77.91\n21.9\nTransaction Enterprise Value(1) / EBITDA:\nCY2021E\n10.8x\nCY2022E\n8.9\nMerger Consideration per Share / EPS:\nCY2021E\n33.5x\nCY2022E\n24.2\n(1)\nBased on projected debt and pro forma adjusted cash balance as of December 31, 2020 as provided by Company management.\n60\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany Change-of-Control Financial Analyses\nRecap of Company Change-of-Control Financial Analyses. In evaluating the Company in connection with rendering\nits opinion, Guggenheim Securities performed various financial analyses which are summarized in the table below and\ndescribed in more detail elsewhere herein, including a discounted cash flow analysis, a selected precedent merger and\nacquisition transactions analysis and a selected publicly traded companies analysis. Solely for informational\nreference purposes, Guggenheim Securities also reviewed the historical trading price range for the shares of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock since the Company announced its agreement to sell the MCC Business and Wall Street\nequity research analysts\u2019 price targets for the shares of Magellan common stock.\nRecap of Company Change-of-Control Financial Analyses\nMerger Consideration\n$95.00\nReference Range \nfor the Company on \na Change-of- \nControl Basis(1)\nFinancial Analyses\nLow\nHigh\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\n$87.75\n$111.50\nSelected Precedent M&A Transactions Analysis\n81.75\n96.25\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis\n71.25\n85.00\nFor Informational Reference Purposes\nThe Company\u2019s Low / High Stock Price Since MCC Business Sale Announcement\n(April 30, 2020)\n$57.38\n$87.52\nWall Street Equity Research Share Price Targets\n92.00\n98.00\n(1)\nRounded to the nearest $0.25 (except trading range).\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. Guggenheim Securities performed a stand-alone discounted cash flow analysis of\nthe Company based on projected unlevered free cash flows for the Company and an estimate of the Company\u2019s\nterminal/continuing value at the end of the projection horizon.\nIn performing its discounted cash flow analysis with respect to the Company:\n\u2022\nGuggenheim Securities utilized the January 2021 Forecasts.\n\u2022\nGuggenheim Securities used a discount rate range of 7.5% - 8.5% based on its estimate of the Company\u2019s\nweighted average cost of capital (which was estimated based on Guggenheim Securities\u2019 (i) investment\nbanking and capital markets judgment and experience in valuing companies similar to the Company and (ii)\napplication of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain (a) general inputs such as the\nprospective U.S. equity risk premium and the corresponding risk-free rate and (b) company-specific inputs\nsuch as the subject company\u2019s forward-looking equity beta reference range, the subject company\u2019s\nassumed forward-looking capital structure and the corresponding blended cost of debt, the subject\ncompany\u2019s prospective marginal cash income tax rate and, as applicable, the appropriate size/liquidity\npremium for the subject company).\n\u2022\nIn estimating the Company\u2019s terminal/continuing value for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis,\nGuggenheim Securities used a reference range of perpetual growth rates of the Company\u2019s terminal year\nunlevered free cash flow of 1.0% - 2.0%. Guggenheim Securities selected such terminal/continuing value-\nrelated perpetual growth rates based on its professional judgment, taking into account various\nconsiderations and factors, including among others (i) the nature of the Company\u2019s businesses, including\nrecent and expected trends in and competitive dynamics with respect to, and expected long-term growth\nprospects for, the industry and markets in which the Company operates, (ii) the January 2021 Forecasts and\n(iii) then-prevailing market expectations regarding U.S. long-term economic growth and U.S. long-term\ninflation. The terminal/continuing values implied by the foregoing perpetual growth rate reference range\nwere cross-checked for reasonableness by reference to the Company\u2019s implied terminal year EBITDA\nmultiples.\n61\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 discounted cash flow analysis resulted in an overall reference range of $87.75 - $111.50 per\nshare.\nSelected Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transactions Analysis. Guggenheim Securities reviewed and analyzed\ncertain financial metrics associated with selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions announced since\nJanuary 1, 2006 involving target companies in the pharmacy & specialty benefit managers and behavioral health\nsectors, and target companies in the managed care sector that Guggenheim Securities deemed relevant for purposes\nof this analysis.

Guggenheim Securities reviewed and analyzed the Company\u2019s\nhistorical stock price performance, trading metrics and historical and projected/forecasted financial performance\ncompared to corresponding data for selected publicly traded companies that Guggenheim Securities deemed relevant\nfor purposes of this analysis. Guggenheim Securities calculated, among other things, various public market trading\nmultiples for the Company and the selected publicly traded companies (in the case of the selected publicly traded\ncompanies, based on Wall Street equity research consensus estimates and each company\u2019s most recent publicly\navailable financial filings), which are summarized in the table below:\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis\nCY 2021E \nShare\nPrice / \nEPS\nPublicly Traded Companies\nProvidence Service Corporation\n25.2x\nTivity Health, Inc.\n14.4\nOption Care Health, Inc.\nNM\nUnitedHealth Group\n19.2\nCVS Health Corporation\n9.1\nCigna Corporation\n10.1\nAnthem, Inc.\n12.6\nHumana, Inc.\n18.9\nCentene Corporation\n11.4\nMolina Healthcare, Inc.(1)\n15.4\nStatistical Summary\nMedian\n14.4x\nThe Company\nManagement Forecast\n29.2x\nWall Street Forecast\n24.0\n(1)\nPro forma for Molina\u2019s acquisition of Affinity Health Plan and the MCC Business\nIn performing its selected publicly traded companies analysis with respect to the Company, Guggenheim Securities\nselected a reference range of trading price / adjusted earnings per share multiple of 13.0x - 18.0x, based on\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 professional judgment, and applied that range to CY 2021E EPS (adjusted, at the direction of\nthe Company\u2019s management, to exclude interest income associated with proceeds from the MCC Business Sale) for\npurposes of evaluating the Company on a stand-alone public market trading basis, which resulted in an overall\nreference range of $71.25-$85.00 per share for purposes of evaluating shares of Company common stock on a stand-\nalone public market trading basis.\nOther Financial Reviews Solely for Informational Reference Purposes\nIn order to obtain certain context for the financial analyses in connection with its opinion as described above,\nGuggenheim Securities undertook various additional financial reviews as summarized below solely for informational\nreference purposes. As a general matter, Guggenheim Securities did not consider such additional financial reviews to\nbe determinative methodologies for purposes of its opinion.\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHigh and Low Stock Prices since MCC Business Sale Announcement. Guggenheim Securities reviewed the trading\nprice of shares of Company common stock for the period beginning April 30, 2020 (the announcement date of the\nMCC Business Sale) and ending December 31, 2020. Among other things, Guggenheim Securities noted that the\nrange of such high and low trading prices was $57.38-$87.52.\nWall Street Equity Research Analyst Stock Price Targets. Guggenheim Securities reviewed selected Wall Street\nequity research analyst stock price targets for the Company as published prior to December 31, 2020. Guggenheim\nSecurities noted that such Wall Street equity research analyst stock price targets for the shares of Magellan common\nstock were $92.00-$98.00 per share.\nOther Considerations\nExcept as described in the summary above, the Company did not provide specific instructions to, or place any\nlimitations on, Guggenheim Securities with respect to the procedures to be followed or factors to be considered in\nperforming its financial analyses or providing its opinion. The type and amount of consideration payable in the\nMerger were determined through negotiations between the Company and Centene and were approved by the Board.\nThe Company\u2019s decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board. Guggenheim Securities\u2019\nopinion was just one of the many factors taken into consideration by the Board. Consequently, Guggenheim\nSecurities\u2019 financial analyses should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Board with respect to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of Guggenheim Securities\u2019 opinion, of the Merger\nConsideration to the holders of shares of Magellan common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of Guggenheim Securities\u2019 engagement, the Company has agreed to pay Guggenheim Securities\na cash transaction fee entirely contingent upon the consummation of the Merger, which cash transaction fee is\nestimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $13 million. In\naddition, the Company agreed to reimburse Guggenheim Securities for certain expenses and to indemnify\nGuggenheim Securities against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.\nAside from its current engagement by the Company, Guggenheim Securities has not been previously engaged during\nthe past two years by the Company and/or its affiliates known to Guggenheim Securities, nor has Guggenheim\nSecurities been previously engaged during the past two years by Centene and/or its affiliates known to Guggenheim\nSecurities, to provide financial advisory, capital markets or investment banking services for which Guggenheim\nSecurities has received compensation. Guggenheim Securities may seek to provide the Company and Centene and\ntheir respective affiliates with financial advisory, capital markets and investment banking services unrelated to the\nMerger in the future, for which services Guggenheim Securities would expect to receive compensation.\nGuggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for\nits and their own accounts and the accounts of customers, including but not limited to: asset, investment and wealth\nmanagement\u037e insurance services\u037e investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring\u037e\nmerchant banking\u037e fixed income and equity sales, trading and research\u037e and derivatives, foreign exchange and\nfutures. In the ordinary course of these activities, Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities may (i)\nprovide such financial services to the Company, Centene, other participants in the Merger and their respective\naffiliates, for which services Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities may have received, and may\nin the future receive, compensation and (ii) directly and indirectly hold long and short positions, trade and otherwise\nconduct such activities in or with respect to loans, debt and equity securities and derivative products of or relating to\nthe Company, Centene, other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates. Furthermore, Guggenheim\nSecurities and its affiliates and related entities and Guggenheim Securities\u2019 or their respective directors, officers,\nemployees, consultants and agents may have investments in the Company, Centene, other participants in the Merger\nand their respective affiliates.\nConsistent with applicable legal and regulatory guidelines, Guggenheim Securities has adopted certain policies and\nprocedures to establish and maintain the independence of its research departments and personnel. As a result,\nGuggenheim Securities\u2019 research analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and\npublish research reports with respect to the Company, Centene, other participants in the Merger and their respective\naffiliates that differ from the views of Guggenheim Securities\u2019 investment banking personnel.\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInterests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger",

You should keep this in\nmind when considering the recommendation of the Board for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. The members of\nthe Board were aware of these interests and considered them at the time they approved the Merger Agreement and in\nmaking their recommendation that Magellan stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests are\ndescribed below.\nThe amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be\naccurate as of the date referenced\u037e therefore, the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become payable may\nmaterially differ from the amounts set forth below.\nTreatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, as of the Effective Time:\n\u2022\neach outstanding Company Option will be converted into an adjusted option with the same terms and\nconditions as were applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including\ndouble-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the\nCompany\u2019s retirement policy) and relating to the number of shares of Centene common stock equal to the\nproduct of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock subject to such Company Option, multiplied\nby (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole\nshare. The exercise price per share of Centene common stock subject to any adjusted option will be an\namount equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of Magellan common stock subject to such\nCompany Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio,\nwith any fractional cents rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The exercise price per share of Centene\ncommon stock subject to any adjusted option and the number of shares of Centene common stock subject\nto any such adjusted option will be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section\n409A of the Code, and, in the case of Company Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock\noptions within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of\nthe Code\u037e\n\u2022\neach outstanding Company PSU will be converted into a restricted stock unit with the same terms and\nconditions as were applicable to such Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including\ndouble-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the\nCompany\u2019s retirement policy, but excluding the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such\nCompany PSU which will not apply from and after the Effective Time) and relating to the number of shares\nof Centene common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock\nsubject to such Company PSU based on the achievement of the applicable performance metrics at the\ntarget level of performance, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares\nrounded to the nearest whole share\u037e\n\u2022\neach outstanding Company RSA, other than those granted to nonemployee members of the Board, will be\nconverted into a restricted share award with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such\nCompany RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time (including double-trigger vesting and all other\nprovisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the Company\u2019s retirement policy) and\nrelating to the number of shares of Centene common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares\nof Magellan common stock subject to such Company RSA, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange\nRatio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share\u037e\n\u2022\neach outstanding Company Director RSA will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the\nMerger Consideration for each share of Magellan common stock subject to such Company Director RSA,\npayable as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in no event later than five (5) business days\nafter the Effective Time\u037e\n\u2022\neach outstanding Company RSU will be converted into a restricted stock unit with the same terms and\nconditions as were applicable to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including\ndouble-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award\n65TABLE OF CONTENTS\nagreements and the Company\u2019s retirement policy) and relating to the number of shares of Centene common\nstock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock subject to such Company\nRSU, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest\nwhole share\u037e and\n\u2022\neach outstanding Company PCU will be converted into a phantom cash unit with the same terms and\nconditions as were applicable to such Company PCU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including\ndouble-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the\nCompany\u2019s retirement policy) and relating to the number of shares of Centene common stock equal to the\nproduct of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock subject to such Company PCU, multiplied\nby (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share.\nThe estimated aggregated amounts that would become payable to each nonemployee member of the Board in respect\nof his or her equity awards is as follows: Steven J. Shulman, $201,590\u037e Swati Abbot, $201,590\u037e Christopher J. Chen,\n$201,590\u037e Peter A. Feld, $201,590\u037e Mural R. Josephson, $201,590\u037e G. Scott Mackenzie, $201,590\u037e Leslie V. Norwalk,\n$201,590\u037e and Guy P. Sansone, $201,590. Accordingly, the estimated aggregate amount that would become payable to\nall of the nonemployee members of the Board is $1,612,720.\nBecause the Merger Agreement does not provide for the acceleration and \u201ccash-out\u201d of any Company equity awards\nheld by the Company\u2019s executive officers, no executive officer will receive payments in respect of his or her Company\nequity awards as a result of the Merger unless such executive officer is subject to a Qualifying Termination (as\ndefined below) during the Protection Period (as defined below), except that the Merger will result in the single-trigger\nacceleration of a portion of Mr. Fasola\u2019s outstanding equity awards, as summarized below in the section entitled \u201c-\nNew Arrangement with Centene,\u201d beginning on page 69. None of the executives hold Company PCUs or participate\nin the ESPP.\nSee the section below entitled \u201c-Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d beginning on page 69 for an estimate of the\npayments to which each of the Company\u2019s named executive officers would be entitled in respect of his or her equity\nawards upon a termination of the named executive officer\u2019s employment by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or due to\nthe executive officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and agreements,\na \u201cQualifying Termination\u201d) occurring immediately following the Effective Time and the estimated aggregate values of\nMr. Fasola\u2019s outstanding equity awards subject to single-trigger acceleration in connection with the Merger. Further,\nbased on the assumptions described below, the estimated amount that would be payable in respect of the equity\nawards held by Ms. Lewis-Clapper assuming a Qualifying Termination that occurs immediately following the Effective\nTime is as follows: Company Options - $316,958, Company PSUs - $1,025,403 and Company RSUs - $657,357.\nEmployment Agreements with Executive Officers\nThe Company entered into employment agreements (we refer to each such agreement as an \u201cEmployment\nAgreement\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cEmployment Agreements\u201d) with Messrs. Fasola, Bourdon, Haddock, Kamal,\nMurray and Rubin and Ms. Lewis-Clapper.\nUnder the Employment Agreement with Mr. Fasola, upon a termination by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d (including\nby the Company's nonrenewal of the term) or a resignation by the executive for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are\ndefined in the executive\u2019s Employment Agreement), Mr. Fasola is entitled to the following severance payments and\nbenefits: (i) one and one-half times the sum of base salary plus target bonus payable over an 18-month period, (ii)\nreimbursement of the Company\u2019s portion of health insurance premiums for a period of up to 18 months after the date\nof termination, (iii) pro-rata annual bonus for the year of termination based on actual performance, (iv) continued\nvesting of the executive\u2019s sign-on Company PSUs and (v) full acceleration of the executive\u2019s sign-on Company RSUs.\nIf such termination by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or resignation by the executive for \u201cgood reason\u201d occurs on or\nprior to and in connection with, or within two years following a \u201cchange in control\u201d (as defined in the executive\u2019s\nEmployment Agreement), then, in addition to the forgoing severance, Mr. Fasola is entitled to one and one-half times\nthe sum of base salary plus target bonus payable in a single installment immediately upon termination.

The discretionary component is offered to a limited group of executive\nofficers who historically have received this contribution.

If the Employment Agreement, as amended\nby the Letter Agreement, expires after 30 months and no new employment agreement is agreed, Mr. Fasola will be\ntreated as having a Qualifying Termination under his Employment Agreement and the Letter Agreement. The Letter\nAgreement amends the Employment Agreement as follows: (i) Mr. Fasola will be employed by the Surviving\nCorporation or, at the discretion of Centene, CMC, in the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving\nCorporation, reporting to Centene\u2019s Senior Vice President, Technology Innovation and Modernization, (ii) the Letter\nAgreement sets forth Mr. Fasola\u2019s annual and long term compensation, (iii) Mr. Fasola\u2019s legacy incentive equity\nawards that converted into corresponding Centene incentive equity awards in accordance with the terms of the\nMerger Agreement (as described above) will vest 50% immediately following the Effective Time, 25% on the second\nanniversary of the Effective Time and 25% on the 30-month anniversary following the Effective Time, subject to\ncontinued employment through each vesting date or upon an earlier Qualifying Termination, and (iv)\nacknowledgement that the Merger and the changes to Mr. Fasola\u2019s compensation, benefits, duties, responsibilities or\nreporting obligations set forth in the Letter Agreement will not constitute \u201cgood reason\u201d for purposes of the\nEmployment Agreement or any other plan or agreement entered into with or sponsored by the Company or any of its\naffiliates.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the tables below present the estimated amounts of compensation\nthat each named executive officer could receive that are based on or otherwise related to the Merger.

This summary is for general information purposes only and\ndoes not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to stockholders of the\nCompany. This summary is based on current provisions of the Code, existing, proposed and temporary regulations\nthereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are\nsubject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and\nconclusions set forth in this discussion. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal\nRevenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) or any opinion of counsel\n72TABLE OF CONTENTS\nwith respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and no assurance can be\ngiven that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the\nIRS.\nThe summary applies only to stockholders of the Company in whose hands shares of Magellan common stock are\ncapital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This summary does not address foreign, state or local\ntax consequences of the Merger, nor does it address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transactions to\nspecial classes of taxpayers (e.g., stockholders that beneficially own (actually or constructively) more than 5% of the\ntotal fair market value of the shares of Magellan common stock (except as specifically described below), small\nbusiness investment companies, S corporations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,\ncontrolled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, qualified foreign pension funds or qualified\ncollective investment vehicles, persons that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, cooperatives,\nbanks and certain other financial institutions, broker-dealers, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations,\ngovernmental organizations, retirement plans, stockholders that are, or hold shares of Magellan common stock\nthrough, partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, trusts, United States\npersons whose functional currency is not the United States dollar, dealers in securities or foreign currency, traders\nthat mark-to-market their securities, expatriates and former long-term residents of the United States, stockholders\nholding shares of Magellan common stock that are part of a straddle, hedging, constructive sale, conversion or other\nintegrated security transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, stockholders who properly exercise appraisal\nrights with respect to their shares of Magellan common stock, stockholders who hold their shares of Magellan\ncommon stock as \u201cqualified small business stock\u201d or \u201csection 1244 stock,\u201d and stockholders who received shares of\nMagellan common stock in compensatory transactions (including pursuant to the exercise of employee stock\noptions, stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights, as restricted stock or otherwise as compensation). In\naddition, this summary does not address U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes (including any U.S. federal estate\nor gift tax consequences), any aspect of the U.S. alternative minimum tax or Medicare tax on net investment income,\nor any state, local or foreign tax consequence of the Merger.\nThis discussion does not address the tax consequences of acquisitions or dispositions of shares of Magellan\ncommon stock outside the Merger, or transactions pertaining to options or other equity awards of the Company in\nconnection with the Merger.\nFor purposes of this summary, the term \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of Magellan common stock\nthat, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United\nStates\u037e (ii) a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e (iii) an estate, the income\nof which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source\u037e or (iv) a trust, if (A) a United States court is\nable to exercise primary supervision over the trust\u2019s administration and one or more United States persons (within the\nmeaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have authority to control all of the trust\u2019s substantial decisions or (B) the\ntrust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For\npurposes of this summary, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of Magellan common stock\n(other than a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)\nthat is not a U.S. Holder.\nIf a partnership, or another entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds\nshares of the Magellan common stock, the tax treatment of its partners or members generally will depend upon the\nstatus of the partner or member and the partnership\u2019s activities. Accordingly, partnerships or other entities treated as\npartnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes that hold shares of Magellan common stock, and partners or\nmembers in those entities, are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the specific U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to them of the Merger.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME\nTAX CONSEQUENCES TO U.S. HOLDERS AND NON-U.S. HOLDERS. WE URGE U.S. HOLDERS, NON-U.S.\nHOLDERS AND OTHER BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH\nRESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN\n73\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT AND OTHER NON-\nINCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER APPLICABLE U.S. TAX TREATIES AND\nSTATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders. The exchange of shares of Magellan common stock for cash pursuant to the\nMerger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. Holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder\nwho receives cash in exchange for shares of Magellan common stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize capital\ngain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount\nof cash received (determined before the deduction of withholding taxes, if any) and (ii) the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in the shares of Magellan common stock surrendered for cash pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss will be\ndetermined separately for each block of shares of Magellan common stock (that is, shares of Magellan common stock\nacquired at the same cost in a single transaction) surrendered for cash pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or loss\nwould be long-term capital gain or loss, provided that the holding period for such block of shares of Magellan\ncommon stock is more than one year at the time of consummation of the Merger. Long-term capital gain recognized\nby certain non-corporate U.S. Holders is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The\ndeductibility of capital losses by a U.S. Holder is subject to certain limitations.\nTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders. Generally, the exchange of shares of Magellan common stock for cash\npursuant the Merger will not be a taxable transaction to Non-U.S. Holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nunless: (i) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the\ntaxable year of the Merger and certain other conditions are met\u037e (ii) the gain is effectively connected with the Non-\nU.S. Holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business in the United States and, if required by an applicable tax treaty,\nattributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States\u037e or (iii) the\nCompany is or has been a United States real property holding corporation, or \u201cUSRPHC,\u201d for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes at any time within the shorter of the Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period and the five-year period preceding\nthe Merger, the Non-U.S. Holder owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of the shares of\nMagellan common stock at any time within such period, and certain other conditions are satisfied.\nIn the case of clause (i) of the preceding paragraph, gain generally will be subject to tax at a flat rate of 30% (or such\nlower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by certain U.S.-source\ncapital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States).\nIn the case of clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, unless a tax treaty provides otherwise, gain will be subject to\nU.S. federal income tax at the rates generally applicable to a U.S. Holder (and such Non-U.S. Holder should generally\nprovide an IRS Form W-8ECI). A Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation also may be subject to a 30% branch\nprofits tax (or applicable lower treaty rate) with respect to gain recognized under clause (ii). In the case of clause (iii),\nNon-U.S. Holders that have actually or constructively owned more than 5% of the shares of Magellan common stock\nshould consult their tax advisors regarding the process for requesting documentation from the Company to establish\nwhether the Company is a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes and any consequences with respect thereto.\nNon-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the particular U.S. federal, state, and local, or\nforeign tax consequences the Merger and the effect of any applicable tax treaties.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding. Information reporting and backup withholding (at a rate of 24%)\nmay apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply\nto (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies under penalty of perjury that\nsuch U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a\nNon-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification signed under penalty of perjury of such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s foreign\nstatus on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (b) otherwise establishes an\nexemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the\nbackup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability,\nprovided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nThe tax discussion set forth above is included for general information only and is not tax advice. You are urged to\nconsult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you of the Merger, including the\napplicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and other tax laws and treaties.\n74\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe U.S. federal income and other tax consequences to holders or beneficial owners of options or other equity\nawards participating in the Merger or transactions in connection with the Merger with respect to such options or\nequity awards are not discussed herein and such holders or beneficial owners are strongly encouraged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors regarding such tax consequences.",

The HSR Act provides that each party must file a pre-merger\nnotification with the FTC and the DOJ. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the\nexpiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their respective HSR Act notification\nforms or the early termination of that waiting period. If the FTC or DOJ issues a Request for Additional Information\nand Documentary Material prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-\ncalendar-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the\nrequest for additional information, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier.

Unless the FTC and DOJ grant early termination of the HSR Act review period\n(subject to the FTC and DOJ\u2019s lifting of the current suspension of review period early terminations) or the FTC or\nDOJ formally requests additional information concerning the Merger, the waiting period will expire on March 12, 2021.\nAt any time before or after the Merger is completed, the FTC or DOJ could take action under U.S. federal antitrust\nlaws in opposition to the Merger, including seeking to enjoin completion of the Merger, condition adoption of the\nMerger Agreement upon the divestiture of assets of Centene, Magellan or their respective subsidiaries or impose\nrestrictions on Centene\u2019s post-Merger operations or other conditions.

except that a party may not terminate the Merger Agreement as described in\nthis bullet point if the failure of the closing to have occurred prior to 5:00 p.m. on the outside date (as it may\nbe extended) was proximately caused by such party\u2019s breach of, or such party\u2019s failure to perform or\ncomply with, in any material respect, any of its covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nany legal restraint is in effect that has become final and nonappealable, except that a party may not\nterminate the Merger Agreement as described in this bullet point if the

agreements under the Merger Agreement\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe Company stockholder approval is not obtained at the special meeting or at any adjournment or\npostponement thereof at which a vote on the

there will not be any liability or obligation on the part of any party,\nexcept that:\n\u2022\nno termination will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach\u037e\n\u2022\nno termination will affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Amended Confidentiality\nAgreement, the Clean Room Agreement and the synergies clean team agreement between them\u037e and\n\u2022\ncertain other provisions of the Merger Agreement, including provisions with respect to the allocation of\nfees and expenses, including, if applicable, the termination fees described below, will survive such\ntermination.\nTermination Fees\nWe refer to the fees described below as the termination fees.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company must pay Centene a termination\nfee, Centene\u2019s sole and exclusive remedy for any claims arising out of the Merger Agreement will be to receive\npayment of such termination fee, together with any costs and expenses incurred by Centene in enforcing payment of\nsuch termination fee. In no event will the Company be required to pay to Centene more than one termination fee.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that the Company will pay Centene a termination fee of $76,530,000 in cash

contemplated by such\nsuperior acquisition proposal is duly executed and delivered by the Company, the person making such\nsuperior acquisition proposal and all other parties thereto.\nThe Company will pay to Centene a fee in cash equal to the termination fee if (1) Centene or the Company terminates\nthe Merger Agreement due to the Company\u2019s failure to obtain the Company stockholder approval and, at the time of\nsuch termination, Centene would not have been entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement in connection with a\nBoard change of recommendation or a willful breach of the

consummates, any\nalternative acquisition for 50% or more the Company\u2019s capital stock or assets (whether or not referred to in the\nforegoing clause (2)).\nPayment of the termination fee will not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount\nthat will compensate Centene in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and\nopportunities foregone while negotiating the Merger Agreement and in reliance on the Merger Agreement and on the\nexpectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with\nprecision.\nCovenants and Agreements\nConduct of Business of the Company\nThe Company has agreed to certain covenants in the Merger Agreement restricting the conduct of its business\nbetween the date of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger.\nThe Company has agreed that, except as required by the Merger Agreement or by applicable law or as consented

The Company must keep Centene reasonably informed (orally or in writing) on a\ntimely basis of the status and material details of any alternative acquisition proposal, request, inquiry, or offer,\nincluding notifying the other party within 24 hours after the occurrence of any material amendment or modification\nthereof. The Company must also notify Centene in writing within 24 hours of determining to provide information or to\nengage in discussions or negotiations concerning an alternative acquisition proposal.\n88\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor purposes of the Merger Agreement, alternative acquisition proposal means a bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer\nfrom any person (other than Centene or one of its representatives and other than the Merger contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement) or \u201cgroup,\u201d within the meaning of Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act, for, in a single\ntransaction or series of related transactions, any:\n\u2022\nacquisition of assets of the Company and its subsidiaries equal to 25% or more of the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated assets or to which 25% or more of the Company\u2019s revenues or net earnings on a consolidated\nbasis are attributable\u037e\n\u2022\nacquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding Magellan common stock\u037e\n\u2022\ntender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person having beneficial\nownership of 25% or more of the outstanding Magellan common stock\u037e or\n\u2022\nmerger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or\nsimilar transaction involving the Company that would result in any person or \u201cgroup\u201d having beneficial\nownership of 25% or more of the outstanding Magellan common stock or 25% or more of the voting power\nof the surviving entity in a merger involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the\nCompany or such surviving entity.\nChange of Recommendation and Termination\nSubject to the following paragraph, the Board may not change its recommendation that Magellan stockholders vote\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Under the Merger Agreement, a change in recommendation will occur\nif the Board, or any committees thereof (i) changes, withholds, withdraws, qualifies, amends or modifies (or publicly\nproposes to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify), in a manner adverse to Centene, its\nrecommendation, (ii) fails to include its recommendation in this proxy statement, (iii) adopts, approves or\nrecommends, or publicly proposes to adopt, approve or recommend, an alternative acquisition proposal, (iv) if an\nalternative acquisition proposal is publicly announced or disclosed, fails to reaffirm its recommendation within 10\nbusiness days following Centene\u2019s written request to do so or (v) makes any public recommendation or public\nstatement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer, except for a recommendation against such offer or a\n\u201cstop, look and listen\u201d communication under Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. In addition, subject to the\nprovisions summarized above under \u201c-No Solicitation\u201d, neither the Board, nor any committees thereof, may cause or\npermit the Company or any of its subsidiaries, to enter into any acquisition agreement, agreement and plan of merger\nor similar definitive contract, or any other contract constituting, related to or that would reasonably be expected to\nlead to an alternative acquisition proposal or requiring the Company to abandon or terminate the Merger Agreement\nor fail to consummate the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nPrior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, the Board may, make a change of recommendation in response\nto the receipt of a written alternative acquisition proposal (with applicable thresholds in the definition of alternative\nacquisition proposal equal to 75% instead of 25%) that was not solicited in violation of the no-solicitation obligations\ndescribed above, and that the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a\nnationally recognized financial advisor) is reasonably capable of being consummated under its terms and is more\nfavorable from a financial point of view than the Merger to the Company stockholders taking into account all legal,\nregulatory and financial aspects of such proposal, including conditionality, expected timing and likelihood of\nconsummation, the identity of the person making the proposal and any other factor the Board determines in good\nfaith to be relevant, which we refer to as a \u201csuperior acquisition proposal,\u201d and the failure of the Board to make a\nchange of recommendation or to authorize termination of the Merger Agreement in response to such alternative\nacquisition proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Prior to making any such\nchange in recommendation, the Board, must provide Centene with prior written notice of its intention to change its\nrecommendation or authorize termination of the Merger Agreement, which such notice must, among other things,\nidentify the person making such alternative acquisition proposal and provide a copy of such alternative acquisition\nproposal agreement, or the latest draft thereof, and give Centene an opportunity to negotiate in good faith any\nrevisions to the Merger Agreement, which negotiation may be on a non-exclusive basis, during the five business day\nperiod following the delivery of such notice, and take into account any changes to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement proposed by Centene (in the event Centene has proposed any changes to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement and there is a subsequent amendment to any material term of the alternative acquisition proposal, the\nBoard must deliver a new\n89\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnotice to the other party, and give Centene an opportunity to negotiate in good faith any further revisions to the\nMerger Agreement during the two business day period following the delivery of such notice).\nIn addition, prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, the Board may, make a change of recommendation\nin response to a material event, change, effect, development or occurrence, subject to certain exceptions, that was not\nknown to the Board prior to such party\u2019s execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement (or, if known, the\nconsequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable), which event or circumstance, or any\nconsequence thereof, becomes known by the Board after the Company\u2019s execution and delivery of the Merger\nAgreement and before the receipt of the Company stockholder approval, which we refer to as an \u201cintervening event,\u201d\nif the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized\nfinancial advisor) that the failure to change its recommendation in response to such intervening event would be\ninconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Prior to making any such change in recommendation, the\nBoard must give Centene prior written notice that it intends to change its recommendation, which notice must\ndescribe the facts relating to the intervening event, and give Centene an opportunity to negotiate in good faith any\nrevisions to the Merger Agreement during the five business day period following the delivery of such notice.\nEfforts to Complete the Merger\nEach of Centene and the Company has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,\nand to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to\ncause the conditions to the Merger to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event no later\nthan the outside date, including making all filings to or with, and using reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents\nof, governmental authorities that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger (including the HSR\nAct Clearance, the required filings and required consents and certain other specified filings and consents pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement). In addition, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents of (i)\npersons other than governmental authorities and (ii) governmental authorities in their capacity as a customer (each of\nwhich we refer to as a \u201cthird party\u201d) that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger, except that\nthe Company will not be obligated to make, or commit or agree to make, any concession or payment to, or incur any\nliability to, any such third party to obtain any such consent, and may not make any such concession or payment or\nincur any such liability without Centene\u2019s prior written consent or be required to make, or commit or agree to make,\nany such concession or payment to, or incur any liability that is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing obligations of the Company to use reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents\nfrom such third parties, the Company\u2019s inability or failure to obtain any such consents, and any consequences to the\nextent arising out of or related to such inability or failure, including the termination by any such third party of a\ncontract between such third party and the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the extent related to the Merger, will\nin no event (1) be deemed a breach of, or failure to perform or comply with, a covenant or agreement for purposes of\nthe relevant condition to closing or (2) grant Centene any right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its\nterms or fail to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nIn furtherance and not in limitation of the above, Centene has agreed to take or cause to be taken, do or cause to be\ndone, negotiate, commit to, suffer, agree to and effect any action, commitment, condition, contingency, contribution,\ncost, donation, expense, liability, limitation, loss, obligation, payment, restriction, restraint, requirement, term or\nundertaking (including any divestiture) to the extent necessary to (i) resolve any objection that a governmental\nauthority asserts (or threatens to assert) under any applicable law related to the Merger and (ii) avoid or eliminate any\nimpediment under any applicable law asserted by any such governmental authority related to the Merger, in each\ncase, to the extent necessary to cause the relevant closing conditions to be satisfied at least three (3) business days\nprior to the outside date (which we collectively refer to as \u201cregulatory concessions\u201d). However, neither Centene nor\nany of its affiliates are required to commence or defend any action against any governmental authority in connection\nwith the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (other than administrative applications for\nreconsideration or similar administrative appeals of adverse administrative determinations brought in administrative\nforums related to the HSR Act Clearance or required consents or required filings). Further, Centene and its\nsubsidiaries are not required to take or cause to be taken, do or cause to be done, propose, negotiate, commit to,\nsuffer, agree to or effect any regulatory concession (including any divestiture) that, individually or in the aggregate\nwith all regulatory concessions, would or would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the\nbusiness, assets, liabilities, financial condition\n90\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor results of operations of (1) Centene and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (2) the Company and its subsidiaries,\ntaken as a whole, or (3) Centene and its subsidiaries (including the Company and its subsidiaries), taken as a whole,\nafter giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (which is referred to as the \u201ccombined\ncompany\u201d), except that (x) for purposes of each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (3), Centene and its subsidiaries,\ntaken as a whole, and the combined company, respectively, will be deemed to be of the size, scope and scale, and with\nthe business, assets, liabilities, financial condition and results of operations, of the Company and its subsidiaries,\ntaken as a whole, and (y) in determining whether any regulatory concession, individually or in the aggregate with all\nother regulatory concessions, would or would reasonably be expected to result in such a material adverse effect\nunder each of the above clauses (1), (2) or (3), any adverse impact on the synergies reasonably expected to be\nrealized from the Merger will (without duplication) be taken into account (any such regulatory concession,\nindividually or in the aggregate, is referred to as a \u201cburdensome condition\u201d).\nNotwithstanding the Company\u2019s covenants and agreements summarized above with respect to efforts to consummate\nthe Merger, without Centene\u2019s prior written consent, the Company will not and will not permit any of its subsidiaries\nor any of their respective representatives to take or cause to be taken, do or cause to be done, propose, negotiate,\ncommit to, suffer, agree to or effect any regulatory concession.\nEmployee Benefits Matters\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Centene agreed that each employee of the Company or their subsidiaries\nwho continues to remain employed with Centene, the surviving corporation or its subsidiaries (each of whom we refer\nto as a \u201cContinuing Employee\u201d) will, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending one year\nthereafter, be provided with (i) an annual base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than the annual base\nsalary or wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company or their subsidiaries, as applicable,\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash incentive opportunities and target long-term incentive\ncompensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee by the\nCompany or their subsidiaries, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) target long-term\nincentive compensation opportunities that are no less than those granted by the Company in connection with the\nmost recent annual long-term incentive compensation grant cycle of the Company.

        "APPRAISAL RIGHTS": {
            "text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS\nRecord holders of Magellan common stock who comply with the procedures summarized below will be entitled to\nappraisal rights if the Merger is completed. Under Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as \u201cSection 262\u201d),\nholders of shares of Magellan common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly demanded and\nperfected and not withdrawn or lost are entitled, in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration, to have the \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of their shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nMerger) at the Effective Time judicially determined and paid to them in cash by complying with the provisions of\nSection 262. Magellan is required to send a notice to that effect to each stockholder not less than 20 days prior to the\nspecial meeting. This proxy statement constitutes that notice to the record holders of Magellan common stock.\nThe following is a brief summary of Section 262, which sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal\nrights. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of the applicable requirements, and is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to Section 262, a copy of the text of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E. If you\nwish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in\nAnnex E. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 may result in the loss of your\nappraisal rights under the DGCL. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it\nconstitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.\nStockholders of record who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must do all of the following: (i) not vote in favor of\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) deliver in the manner set forth below a written demand for appraisal of the\nstockholder\u2019s shares of Magellan common stock to the Secretary of Magellan before the vote on the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement at the special meeting, (iii) continuously hold the shares of record from the date of making the\ndemand through completion of the Merger and (iv) otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262.\nOnly a holder of record of Magellan common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that\nholder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of record. The demand should set\nforth, fully and correctly, the stockholder\u2019s name as it appears on the certificates representing shares. If shares are\nowned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed\nby the fiduciary. If shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,\nthe demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent of two or\nmore joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record\u037e however, the agent must\nidentify the record owner and expressly disclose that, in exercising the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the\nrecord owner.\nA record owner, such as a broker, who holds shares as a nominee for others may exercise appraisal rights with respect\nto the shares held for all or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which the holder is the record owner. In that\ncase, the written demand must set forth the number of shares covered by the demand. Where the number of shares is\nnot expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares outstanding in the name of the record owner.\nBeneficial owners who are not record owners and who intend to exercise appraisal rights should consult with the\nrecord owner to determine the appropriate procedures for having the record holder make a demand for appraisal with\nrespect to the beneficial owner\u2019s shares. Any holder of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d who desires appraisal rights with\nrespect to those shares must take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for\nappraisal is made by the record owner of the shares.\nShares held through brokerage firms, banks and other financial institutions are frequently deposited with and held of\nrecord in the name of a nominee of a central security depository, such as Cede & Co., The Depository Trust\nCompany\u2019s nominee. A demand for appraisal with respect to such shares must be made by or on behalf of the\ndepository nominee and it must identify the depository nominee as the record owner. Any beneficial holder of shares\ndesiring appraisal rights with respect to such shares which are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other financial\ninstitution is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is made by the record holder.\nAs required by Section 262, a demand for appraisal must be in writing and must reasonably inform Magellan of the\nidentity of the record holder (which might be a nominee as described above) and of such holder\u2019s intention to seek\nappraisal of the holder\u2019s shares.\n97TABLE OF CONTENTS\nStockholders of record who elect to demand appraisal of their shares must mail or deliver their written demand to:\nMagellan Health, Inc.\n\u2003\n4801 E. Washington Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85034 \nAttention: David Haddock, General Counsel and Secretary\nThe written demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder\u2019s name and mailing address. The written demand\nmust reasonably inform Magellan that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of his, her or its\nshares. The written demand must be received by Magellan prior to the vote on the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement at the special meeting. Neither voting (via the virtual meeting website or by proxy) against, abstaining\nfrom voting on or failing to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will alone suffice to constitute a written\ndemand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. In addition, the stockholder must not vote its shares of\nMagellan common stock in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. An executed proxy that does not contain\nvoting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and will cause the\nstockholder\u2019s right of appraisal to be lost. Therefore, a stockholder who desires to exercise appraisal rights should\neither (x) refrain from executing and submitting the enclosed proxy card or (y) vote by proxy against the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement or affirmatively register an abstention with respect thereto.\nWithin 120 days after completion of the Merger, but not thereafter, either the Surviving Corporation in the Merger or\nany stockholder who has timely and properly demanded appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares and who has\ncomplied with the requirements of Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or any beneficial owner for\nwhich a demand for appraisal has been properly made by the record holder, may commence an appraisal proceeding\nby filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of\na petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of all stockholders who\nhave properly demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of Magellan as the Surviving Corporation\nto file an appraisal petition, and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the\nSurviving Corporation will file such a petition or that the Surviving Corporation will initiate any negotiations with\nrespect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should\ninitiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner\nprescribed in Section 262.\nWithin 120 days after completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with the applicable provisions of\nSection 262 will be entitled, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), to receive from the\nSurviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Magellan common stock not\nvoting in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the Surviving\nCorporation and the number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares held in a\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition or request from\nthe Surviving Corporation for the statement described in the previous sentence. Such statement must be given within\n10 days after the request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a Magellan stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the\nSurviving Corporation, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a\ncopy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and\naddresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of Magellan common stock and with\nwhom agreements as to the value of their shares of Magellan common stock have not been reached. After notice to\nwhom agreements as to the value of their shares of Magellan common stock have not been reached. After notice to\nstockholders who have demanded appraisal, if such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing upon the petition and determine those stockholders who have\ncomplied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery may\nrequire the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by\ncertificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of\nthe appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. The Delaware Court of Chancery must dismiss an\nappraisal proceeding as to all Magellan stockholders who assert appraisal\n98\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrights unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or\nseries eligible for appraisal, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of\nshares seeking appraisal exceeds $1 million, or (iii) the Merger was approved pursuant to Section 253 or Section 267\nof the DGCL. Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted, as to the shares of\nMagellan common stock owned by such stockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of\nChancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.\nAfter a hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which stockholders are entitled to\nappraisal rights and thereafter will appraise the shares owned by those stockholders, determining the fair value of the\nshares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with\ninterest to be paid, if any, upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in\nits discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in subsection (h) of Section 262,\ninterest from the date the Merger is completed through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded\nquarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharges) as established from\ntime to time during the period between the date the Merger is completed and the date of payment of the judgment. At\nany time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the combined company may pay to each former Magellan\nstockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided in\nSection 262 only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the\nshares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interests theretofore accrued, unless paid at that\ntime. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., et al., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods\nwhich are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered in an appraisal proceeding and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors\ninvolving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair\nvalue the court may consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise\nand any other facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future\nprospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be determined \u201cexclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc.,\nthe Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known\nelements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that\n\u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the\ndate of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined under\nSection 262 could be more than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration they are entitled to receive\npursuant to the Merger Agreement if they do not seek appraisal of their shares, and that opinions of investment\nbanking firms as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a transaction are not\nopinions as to fair value under Section 262. Magellan reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that\nfor purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Magellan common stock is less than the applicable Merger\nConsideration.\nThe cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the\nparties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include\nattorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that all or a portion of the expenses\nincurred by such stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to\nappraisal. In the absence of such a determination of assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nFrom and after the date of completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in\ncompliance with Section 262 will not, after completion of the Merger, be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares\nsubject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for\ndividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to completion of the Merger.\nWithin 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give notice of the date that the Merger\nbecame effective to each of Magellan\u2019s stockholders who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal, who\n99\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndid not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and who has otherwise complied with Section\n262. At any time within 60 days after completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has demanded appraisal and\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will have the right to\nwithdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the cash to which the stockholder is entitled\npursuant to the Merger. After this period, the stockholder may withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal\nonly with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery within 120 days after completion of the Merger, stockholders\u2019 rights to appraisal will cease and all\nstockholders will be entitled only to receive the Merger Consideration as provided for in the Merger Agreement. No\npetition timely filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding appraisal will be dismissed as to any stockholders\nwithout the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and that approval may be conditioned upon such terms as\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. However, the preceding sentence will not affect the right of any\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined the proceeding as a named party to withdraw\nsuch stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after\ncompletion of the Merger.\nThe foregoing is a brief summary of Section 262 that sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal\nrights. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to Section 262, a copy of the text of which is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement.\nFailure to comply strictly with all the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. Consequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are strongly urged to\nconsult a legal advisor before attempting to exercise your appraisal rights.\n100\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND DATA",
