The approval of the Advisory Compensation Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of\nCompany Capital Stock or vote at the virtual special meeting, or the failure to instruct your broker on\nhow to vote will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but,\nassuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the\nAdjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same\n20 \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will\nhave no effect on the Advisory Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.

Instead, Radius will remain an independent public company, Class A Common Stock will\ncontinue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and Radius will\ncontinue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nUnder certain circumstances, Radius will be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee and,\nunder certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay Radius the Parent Termination Fee. For\nmore information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202f\nTermination Fees\u201d.\nWhy are Company Stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Advisory\nCompensation Proposal?\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Radius to seek an advisory (nonbinding)\nvote with respect to certain payments that will or may be paid or become payable to its named executive\nofficers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby.\nWhat will happen if Company Stockholders do not approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal at the Special\nMeeting?\nThe vote on executive compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to Radius\u2019 named\nexecutive officers that is based or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the Merger Agreement\nProposal. Accordingly, Company Stockholders may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal\nand vote not to approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the Advisory\nCompensation Proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on the Company or the Board\u037e\nas the Company is contractually obligated to pay such compensation, such compensation will or may be\npaid or become payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the Mergers are\nconsummated and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.\nWhat do I need to do now?\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy\nstatement, including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this\nproxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Mergers and\nhow they affect you.

This process, which is\ncommonly referred to as \u201chouseholding\u201d, potentially provides extra convenience for Company\nStockholders and cost savings for companies.\nRadius and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy\nmaterials to multiple Company Stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary\ninstructions have been received from the affected Company Stockholders.

Radius expects to pay Innisfree M&A Incorporated a fee of $30,000, plus certain costs\nassociated with additional services, as necessary, and Innisfree M&A Incorporated will be reimbursed\nfor certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Radius has agreed to indemnify Innisfree M&A\nIncorporated against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of\nproxies (subject to certain exceptions).\nRadius also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their\nrespective agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of Company\nCapital Stock. Radius directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by\nelectronic means or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.\nWhen do you expect the Mergers to be completed?\nWe currently expect to complete the Mergers in the third quarter of 2023. However, the exact timing of\ncompletion of the Mergers cannot be predicted because the Mergers are subject to the closing\nconditions specified in the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which\nare outside of our control. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fConditions to the Closing of the Mergers\u201d.\nHow can I obtain additional information about Radius?\nRadius will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2022\nAnnual Report to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, without charge to any Company Stockholder who makes a request in writing or by\ntelephone to Radius\u2019 Investor Relations Department at 3 Bala Plaza East, Suite 502, Bala Cynwyd, PA\n19004 or +1 (610) 660-4910.

For these statements, we claim the protections of the safe harbor for forward-looking\nstatements contained in such Sections. These forward-looking statements include information about\npossible or assumed future results of our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans\nand objectives. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-\nlooking terminology, including the terms \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d or similar expressions, their negative or other variations or comparable\nterminology.\nForward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations based upon our\nhistorical performance and on our current plans, estimates and expectations in light of information available\nto us.

Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties and assumptions\nrelating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business, prospects, growth strategy and\nliquidity and the Mergers. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking\nstatements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking\nstatements as a prediction of actual results.\nCertain important factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected\nresults are summarized below. Other factors besides those listed could also adversely affect us. We operate\nin a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to\ntime, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks and uncertainties or how they may affect\nus. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor,\nor combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-\nlooking statements.\nImportant factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these\nstatements include, but are not limited

As of the Record Date, [56,452,943] votes constitute a majority of the outstanding\nshares of Company Capital Stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by Company Stockholders is a\ncondition to the consummation of the Mergers. The approval of the Advisory Compensation Proposal and\nthe Adjournment Proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the applicable\nproposal.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of\nCompany Capital Stock or vote at the virtual special meeting, or the failure to instruct your broker on how to\nvote will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a\nquorum is present, will have no effect on the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Advisory\nCompensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Each \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the\nAdvisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A so-called \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d results when\nbanks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the\napplicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not\nhave discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from\nthe beneficial owner of such shares. Radius does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting\nbecause the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary\nauthority to vote on proposals that are considered \u201croutine\u201d, whereas each of the proposals to be presented\nat the Special Meeting is considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your\nshares of Company Capital Stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. If you properly sign\nyour proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares\nrepresented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e (2)\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Advisory Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not\npresent, the chairman of the Special Meeting or the Company Board may adjourn or postpone the Special\nMeeting.\nThe Company does not intend to call a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Agreement\nProposal is approved at the Special Meeting.",

These evaluations\nhave focused on, among other things, the business and macroeconomic environment facing digital\ninfrastructure operators, as well as conditions and trends in the industry, and included Company Board\ndiscussions as to the advantages and risks of different strategies for short- and long-term value creation.\nSuch discussions included whether the Company should continue to execute on its strategy as a stand-alone\npublic company, pursue various joint ventures to fund its acquisition growth strategy, including a possible\nminority equity investment in the subsidiaries of the Company that own the Company\u2019s multinational,\ndiversified, cash-yielding portfolio of real property digital infrastructure assets (such subsidiaries,\ncollectively, \u201cYieldCo\u201d and such potential investment, a \u201cYieldCo transaction\u201d), seek to make larger scale\nacquisitions or pursue a sale of the entire Company to a third party (a \u201cWholeCo transaction\u201d).

Following execution of this mutual non-disclosure agreement,\nrepresentatives of the Company and representatives of Party A from time to time discussed potential\nbusiness relationships and strategic opportunities, including potential joint ventures, business combinations\nand other similar transactions.\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into non-disclosure agreements with each of EQT, a financial\nsponsor that we refer to as \u201cParty B\u201d and a financial sponsor that we refer to as \u201cParty C\u201d, to engage in\npreliminary discussions regarding potential capital investments in the Company and its subsidiaries.\nFollowing execution of these non-disclosure agreements, representatives of the Company, on the one hand,\nand representatives of each of EQT and Party C, on the other hand, had preliminary discussions regarding\nvarious capital investment opportunities, including a potential YieldCo transaction.\nOn February 9, 2022, William C.

Goldstein, Chief Operating\nOfficer of the Company, met with representatives of Party A in New York City (with Mr. Goldstein\nparticipating remotely) to have preliminary discussions regarding various capital investment opportunities,\nincluding a potential YieldCo transaction.\nOn February 25, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior\nmanagement of the Company in attendance, at which meeting, among other things, the Company Board\ndiscussed the strategic rationale of a potential YieldCo transaction to further fund the Company\u2019s acquisition\ngrowth strategy and determined to undertake a process to pursue a YieldCo transaction. As part of this\ndiscussion, Company management discussed with the Company Board features of a potential YieldCo\ntransaction that it would seek in any such process, including: seeking an initial contribution by a minority\ninvestor into YieldCo in the range $300 to $500 million, the proceeds of which would be used to acquire\nadditional cash yielding digital infrastructure assets\u037e subsequent contributions of cash on a pro-rata basis\nbetween the Company and any such minority investor to acquire additional digital infrastructure assets post-\nclosing\u037e and the periodic post-closing receipt by the Company of management and incentive fees and\nreimbursement of certain expenses for the ongoing management of YieldCo\u2019s business and services provided\nto YieldCo by the subsidiaries of the Company that own and operate the Company\u2019s business of developing\nand acquiring digital infrastructure assets (such subsidiaries, collectively, \u201cDevCo\u201d). Based on their\nexpertise and experience in transactions in the digital infrastructure industry, the Company Board determined\nto engage Citi (in a lead role) and Goldman Sachs to act as financial advisors to the Company Board in\nconnection with its exploration of strategic alternatives, including with a respect to a YieldCo transaction.\nFollowing the February 25, 2022 meeting of the Company Board, at the direction of the Company Board,\nmembers of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs initiated a process to\nsolicit interest from potential investors in a YieldCo transaction. During the course of the process, 14\npotential investors (including EQT, Party B, Party C and PSP) were contacted and 11 parties executed non-\ndisclosure agreements (or, in the case of EQT, Party B and Party C, amendments to existing non-disclosure\nagreements). As part of the YieldCo transaction process, Company management and representatives of the\nCompany Board\u2019s financial and legal advisors held a number of meetings with parties evaluating a YieldCo\ntransaction to discuss certain due diligence matters. Among these non-disclosure agreements executed in\nconnection with the YieldCo transaction process, three contained standstill agreements, all of which expired\nupon the Company\u2019s entry into the Merger Agreement.\nOn March 18, 2022, at the direction of the Company Board, Citi and Goldman Sachs sent a process letter\nto each of the potential counterparties that had expressed interest in a YieldCo transaction, along with a draft\nterm sheet for a YieldCo transaction, requesting the submission of written proposals and markups to a draft\nterm sheet for a YieldCo transaction that had been prepared by the Company by April 12, 2022.\n39 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDuring the weeks of March 21, 2022 and March 28, 2022, Company management and representatives of\nthe Company Board\u2019s financial and legal advisors held management presentations with potential\ncounterparties in a YieldCo transaction (including EQT, PSP, Party B, Party C, a financial sponsor that we\nrefer to as \u201cParty D\u201d and a financial sponsor that we refer to as \u201cParty E\u201d).\nOn March 28, 2022, the Company received from Party A an indication of interest to acquire the Company\nin a WholeCo transaction for $17.50 per share of Company Class A Stock in cash. Party A\u2019s indication of\ninterest in a WholeCo transaction was unsolicited. The Company Board was notified of Party A\u2019s indication\nof interest in a WholeCo transaction after receipt thereof.\nOn April 6, 2022, Mr. Berkman and a representative of Citi met with representatives of Party E to discuss\nParty E\u2019s interest in pursuing a YieldCo transaction.\nOn April 11, 2022, Mr. Berkman, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Judson, Thomas C. King, a member of the Company\nBoard, and a representative of Citi, on the one hand, and representatives of Party C, on the other hand, met\nfor dinner in New York City to continue their preliminary discussions, including with respect to a YieldCo\ntransaction.\nOn April 12, 2022, a representative of Party A contacted a representative of Citi on an unsolicited basis\nto indicate that Party A remained interested in pursuing a WholeCo transaction.\nOn April 12, 2022 and April 13, 2022, the Company received two proposals for a YieldCo transaction, one\nproposal for a minority investment in each of YieldCo and DevCo and one proposal for a majority investment\nin YieldCo. While these proposals are difficult to compare due to different characteristics and terms, the\nproposals received consisted of the following headline terms:\na written proposal from Party B to invest $500 million to acquire a 24.3% stake in YieldCo, which\nproposal included a list of issues in the draft term sheet for a YieldCo transaction\u037e\na written proposal from Party D to invest $300 million to acquire a 22.1% stake in YieldCo, which\nproposal included a markup of the draft term sheet for a YieldCo transaction\u037e a written proposal from\nPSP to invest $595 million to acquire a 25% stake in YieldCo and an amount to be determined to\nacquire a 25% stake in DevCo, which proposal included a list of issues for certain terms of its\nproposed minority investment in each of YieldCo and DevCo\u037e and\na written proposal from EQT to acquire a majority stake in YieldCo in the range of 75% to 80%\nstructured as a $1,050 million purchase of equity from YieldCo and a $200 million cash contribution to\nYieldCo (such proposals, collectively, the \u201cApril 2022 YieldCo Proposals\u201d).\nIn addition to proposing structures and investment amounts that differed from the YieldCo approach set out\nin the YieldCo process letter, the April 2022 YieldCo Proposals varied with respect to, among other things, the\nterms of the management and incentive fees for the Company and certain other terms relating to governance,\ntransfer restrictions and post-closing acquisition of digital infrastructure assets.\nIn mid-April 2022, representatives of Citi, on the one hand, and representatives of EQT, on the other\nhand, held telephone calls to discuss a YieldCo transaction. During such calls, EQT indicated to Citi that it\nwould be interested in pursuing a WholeCo transaction. EQT\u2019s indication of interest in a WholeCo\ntransaction was unsolicited.\nOn April 14, 2022, Party E, which had entered into a non-disclosure agreement with the Company on\nMarch 14, 2022 in connection with the YieldCo transaction process, submitted a proposal letter that indicated\nParty E had evaluated a YieldCo transaction, but believed it would be able to provide a significantly more\ncompelling proposal through a WholeCo transaction. Party E did not provide a valuation at which it was\nproposing to engage in a WholeCo transaction, but identified key due diligence information that it would\nneed to finalize a more concrete proposal. The Company Board was notified of Party E\u2019s indication of interest\nin a WholeCo transaction after receipt thereof. Party E\u2019s indication of interest in a WholeCo transaction was\nunsolicited.\nOn April 19, 2022, Party C submitted a written indication of interest to acquire the Company in a\nWholeCo transaction for $20.25 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash. Party C\u2019s indication of\n40 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninterest in a WholeCo transaction was unsolicited. The Company Board was notified of Party C\u2019s indication\nof interest in a WholeCo transaction after receipt thereof.\nOn April 19, 2022, members of Company management and representatives of Citi, on the one hand, and\nrepresentatives of Party E, on the other hand, held a telephone call to discuss certain of the due diligence\nmatters identified in the proposal letter received from Party E.\nOn April 22, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior\nmanagement of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel to the Company\nBoard (\u201cCravath\u201d), and Citi in attendance, at which meeting the Company Board discussed the April 2022\nYieldCo Proposals, as well as the unsolicited indications of interest in a WholeCo transaction received from\nParty A, Party C and Party E. Representatives of Citi reviewed with the Company Board its preliminary\nfinancial analyses relating to YieldCo as part of the YieldCo transaction process.\nOn April 24, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior\nmanagement of the Company and representatives of Cravath in attendance, at which meeting the Company\nBoard continued its discussion of the April 2022 YieldCo Proposals and the unsolicited indications of\ninterest in a WholeCo transaction received from Party A, Party C and Party E and the advantages and risks of\nexploring a potential YieldCo transaction only, potential WholeCo transaction only or a dual-track process.\nAdditionally, the Company Board discussed, among other things, then current macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding various future economic scenarios, and the potential impact on the Company\u2019s incremental cost of\ncapital required to support its acquisition growth strategy, the potential impact on the short- and long-term\ntrading price of shares of Class A Common Stock and the potential impact on the Company achieving the\nbenefits of greater scale over the short- and long-term (each of which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s\nfinancial performance).\nFollowing that discussion, the Company Board determined that it would direct its financial advisors to\n(a) continue discussions with Party B regarding its proposed minority investment in YieldCo and PSP\nregarding its proposed minority investment in each of YieldCo and DevCo and (b) solicit interest from\npotential counterparties in a WholeCo transaction (including EQT, in light of its proposal to acquire a\nmajority stake in YieldCo). The Company Board declined to move forward with Party D based on a holistic\nreview of the investment, structuring and other terms on which Party D had proposed to engage in a YieldCo\ntransaction.\nFollowing the April 24, 2022 meeting of the Company Board, at the direction of the Company Board, the\nCompany and its financial advisors undertook a dual-track process to continue discussions with Party B\nregarding a YieldCo transaction and with PSP regarding a minority investment in each of YieldCo and DevCo\nand to solicit interest from potential counterparties in a WholeCo transaction. During the course of this\nprocess, 20 potential buyers were contacted (including EQT, PSP, other participants from the YieldCo\ntransaction process and Party A, a potential strategic buyer that we refer to as \u201cParty F\u201d and a potential\nstrategic buyer that we refer to as \u201cParty G\u201d) and ten parties either executed non-disclosure agreements or, in\nthe case of parties that were participants in the YieldCo transaction process, had existing non-disclosure\nagreements with the Company (which existing agreements, in certain cases, were amended in connection with\nthe WholeCo transaction process). Among such non-disclosure agreements, eight contained standstill\nagreements, all of which expired upon the Company\u2019s entry into the Merger Agreement. Based on\ndiscussions with representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs, and in light of what had then become a volatile\nmacroeconomic environment with rising inflation and rising interest rates, Company management were aware\nthat potential counterparties in a WholeCo transaction process may have difficulty obtaining acquisition\nfinancing or be unable to obtain acquisition financing on terms that would support a purchase price that\nwould be attractive to Company Stockholders. The Company directed representatives of Citi and Goldman\nSachs to advise participants in the WholeCo transaction process that the Company expected its existing\nindebtedness (other than the Convertible Notes) to be portable in connection with any WholeCo transaction.\nAdditionally, as part of the WholeCo transaction process, Company management and the Company Board\u2019s\nfinancial and legal advisors held a number of meetings with parties evaluating a WholeCo transaction to\ndiscuss certain due diligence matters.\nOn May 4, 2022, at PSP\u2019s request, Mr. Berkman, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Judson and representatives of Citi and\nGoldman Sachs, on the one hand, met with representatives of PSP, on the other hand, in New York City to\nfurther discuss PSP\u2019s proposed minority investment in each of YieldCo and DevCo.\n41 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn May 6, 2022, Bloomberg reported that the Company was exploring strategic options, including a\npotential WholeCo transaction. Following the Bloomberg report, PSP informed the Company that it wished to\npursue a WholeCo transaction and that if the Company Board determined it would not pursue a WholeCo\ntransaction that PSP would continue to be interested in pursuing a minority investment in each of YieldCo\nand DevCo.\nOn May 9, 2022, the Company received from Party B a markup of the draft term sheet for a YieldCo\ntransaction, which continued to propose an investment of $500 million for a 24.3% stake in YieldCo.\nBeginning in mid-May 2022, in connection with the WholeCo transaction process, eight potential\ncounterparties (including EQT, PSP, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party E, a financial sponsor that we refer to as\n\u201cParty H\u201d and a financial sponsor that we refer to as \u201cParty I\u201d) were provided access to a virtual data room\nthat contained more information on the Company. Party G did not execute a non-disclosure agreement and\nwas not granted access to such virtual data room.\nOn May 16, 2022, at the direction of the Company Board, Citi and Goldman Sachs sent a process letter\nto each of the potential counterparties that had expressed interest in a WholeCo transaction, requesting the\nsubmission of written proposals for a WholeCo transaction by June 1, 2022.\nOn May 20, 2022, Mr. Berkman met with representatives of Party H to discuss their interest in pursuing a\nWholeCo transaction.\nOn May 24, 2022, the Company Board, acting by unanimous written consent, authorized and created the\nTransaction Committee and empowered the Transaction Committee with full authority to review, consider,\nevaluate, negotiate, accept, reject and recommend any potential WholeCo transaction in which one or more\nofficers, directors, stockholders or affiliates of the Company may have material interests that would be\nadditional to and/or materially different from the interests of disinterested Company Stockholders. The\nCompany Board determined to create the Transaction Committee at this point in recognition of the fact that,\nunlike a YieldCo transaction, a WholeCo transaction could involve such matters. The Company Board\nappointed Mr. King as chair of the Transaction Committee. The Transaction Committee retained Morris,\nNichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP (\u201cMorris Nichols\u201d) as its independent counsel and engaged Barclays, based\non its expertise and experience in transactions in the digital infrastructure industry, to act as its financial\nadvisor. The Transaction Committee met 19 times throughout the WholeCo transaction process.\nOn May 25, 2022, Party B contacted representatives of Citi to indicate that, although a YieldCo\ntransaction was its preferred transaction structure, Party B could pursue a potential WholeCo transaction if\nthe Company Board determined to move forward with a WholeCo transaction in lieu of a YieldCo transaction.\nOn June 1, 2022, the Company received three written proposals for a WholeCo transaction, one verbal\nproposal for a WholeCo transaction and one written proposal for a YieldCo transaction. The proposals were\nas follows: a written proposal for a WholeCo transaction from PSP to acquire the Company with an additional\nminority investor or co-control partner (if any such co-investor could be identified) for $18.12 per share of\nClass A Common Stock in cash\u037e a written proposal for a WholeCo transaction from Party C to acquire the\nCompany for $18.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash\u037e a written proposal for a WholeCo\ntransaction from EQT to acquire the Company for $15.50 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash\u037e a\nverbal indication from Party F that it was interested in acquiring the Company at a valuation in the range of\n$18.00 to $19.50 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash\u037e and a written proposal for a YieldCo transaction\nfrom Party A to invest $306 million to acquire a 50% stake in YieldCo. Party A did not reengage on its prior\nunsolicited proposal for a WholeCo transaction. Neither Party E nor Party I submitted a proposal for a\nWholeCo transaction.\nOn June 6, 2022, representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs engaged in discussions with each of EQT,\nPSP and Party C regarding their written proposals for a WholeCo transaction.\nOn June 6, 2022, the Transaction Committee adopted guidelines to govern discussions between\npotential counterparties in a WholeCo transaction and Company management concerning Company\nmanagement\u2019s willingness to enter into any potential rollover arrangements and/or post-closing employment\n42 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand compensation arrangements (the \u201cJune 2022 Guidelines\u201d). The June 2022 Guidelines were subsequently\nshared with the Company Board and Company management.\nOn June 7, 2022, following a request from the Company to provide its proposal for a WholeCo\ntransaction in writing, Party F informed representatives of Citi that it was no longer prepared to pursue a\nWholeCo transaction at a valuation in the range of $18.00 to $19.50 per share of Class A Common Stock in\ncash and that at that time Party F viewed the value of the Company as closer to its then current market price.\nThe shares of Class A Common Stock closed at $15.57 per share that day.\nOn June 7, 2022, Party H indicated to representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs that they intended to\nsubmit written proposals for a WholeCo transaction, but the Company ultimately did not receive any written\nproposal for a WholeCo transaction from Party H.\nOn June 9, 2022, at the direction of Company management, representatives of Citi and Goldman\ncontacted a financial sponsor that we refer to as \u201cParty J\u201d and a financial sponsor that we refer to as \u201cParty\nK\u201d to assess their interest in a WholeCo transaction. Party J subsequently informed representatives of Citi\nand Goldman Sachs that it was not interested in pursuing a WholeCo transaction. Following two preliminary\ntelephone calls with representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs regarding a WholeCo transaction, Party K\nceased engaging in the WholeCo transaction process.\nOn June 10, 2022, Party A informed representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs that it was planning to\nsubmit a written proposal for a WholeCo transaction but ultimately Party A did not submit such a proposal.\nOn June 13, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior\nmanagement of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Citi and Goldman Sachs in attendance, at which\nmeeting the Company Board directed Citi and Goldman to continue discussions with the parties interested in\na YieldCo transaction\u037e invite EQT, PSP and Party C into the next phase of the WholeCo transaction process\u037e\nand engage with PSP on potential co-bidders.\nOn June 14, 2022, representatives of Citi held separate telephone calls with representatives of each of\nEQT, PSP and Party C to discuss their respective written proposals for a WholeCo transaction and to invite\neach of EQT, PSP and Party C into the next phase of the WholeCo transaction process. Also on this date,\nrepresentatives of Citi held a telephone call with representatives of Party B to discuss Party B\u2019s potential\ninterest in pursuing a WholeCo transaction.\nBeginning on June 14, 2022 and until mid-July 2022, following indications from PSP that it would not be\nable to submit a proposal for a WholeCo transaction on its own, representatives of Citi, on the one hand, and\nrepresentatives of PSP, on the other hand, discussed potential co-bidders and the Company ultimately\nconsented to PSP\u2019s request to discuss its proposed WholeCo transaction with three potential co-bidders\n(one of which was EQT).\nBeginning in June 2022 and until October 2022, the Transaction Committee had several discussions with\nthe holders of Series A Founder Preferred Stock and their counsel concerning the rights of such holders to\nan annual dividend under the terms of the Company Charter and the treatment of such Series A Founder\nPreferred Stock in a potential WholeCo transaction in the valuation ranges under consideration by the\nTransaction Committee and the Company Board during that period. The Merger Agreement provides that\nsuch holders of Series A Founder Preferred Stock are entitled to receive the same Merger Consideration upon\ncompletion of the Company Merger as holders of Class A Common Stock.\nOn June 29, 2022, a representative of Party E contacted representatives of Citi and Goldman to inform\nthem that Party E would not be continuing to engage in discussions regarding a WholeCo transaction.\nOn July 1, 2022, in accordance with the Company Board\u2019s direction and as approved by Company\nmanagement, Citi and Goldman Sachs sent to EQT, PSP and Party C a process letter and provided such\nparties by email an auction draft of the merger agreement that had been prepared by Cravath.\nDuring July, August and September 2022, to facilitate the potential portability of the Company\u2019s existing\nindebtedness (other than the Convertible Notes), Company management\u2019s representatives began\ndiscussions with certain of the Company\u2019s lenders to obtain waivers of, or amendments to, certain change of\ncontrol provisions in the Company\u2019s existing debt agreements that would potentially be implicated by a\n43 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWholeCo transaction (which waivers and amendments we refer to in this section of the proxy statement titled\n\u201c- Background of the Mergers\u201d as the \u201cdebt waivers and consents\u201d). As a condition to providing debt\nwaivers and consents, certain of the Company\u2019s lenders insisted on retaining an ability to call an event of\ndefault under the applicable existing debt agreements if there was not continuity of Company management\nafter the closing of any WholeCo transaction, ultimately, making it clear that such lenders would not consent\nto a WholeCo transaction without certain members of Company management being retained in connection\nwith a WholeCo transaction. As a result, such lenders required the inclusion of a condition that any two of\nMr. Berkman, Mr. Bruce and Mr. Goldstein must continue in their current capacities as Chief Executive\nOfficer, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, respectively, at the closing of any WholeCo\ntransaction in order for such lenders\u2019 waivers and consents to be effective.\nOn July 15, 2022, representatives of Cravath and representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP,\noutside counsel to EQT (\u201cSimpson\u201d), held a telephone call to discuss the auction draft of the merger\nagreement.

The Company Board discussed potential next steps to take with Party C, including\nwhether to grant exclusivity, and reexamined the relative merits and considerations of strategic alternatives\nother than a WholeCo transaction that the Company could pursue, including continuing as a stand-alone\ncompany and potentially pursuing a YieldCo transaction. As part of that discussion, the Company Board\ndiscussed with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols the Company Board\u2019s obligations as they\nrelate to a WholeCo transaction to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable, including, if necessary, by\ngranting exclusivity to Party C if the Company Board believed that it would facilitate obtaining the best price.\nA representative of Cravath then reviewed with the Company Board key points that were open in the Party C\nMerger Agreement. After considering the advantages and risks of proceeding with Party C on an exclusive\nbasis in light of the open points, the Company Board directed Citi and Goldman to engage in further price\ndiscovery with Party C. The Company Board determined that it would not grant exclusivity to Party C until\nParty C had increased its proposed purchase price and shown further movement on key contractual terms\nthat were open.\nOn August 21, 2022, representatives of Citi contacted representatives of Party C to indicate that the\nCompany would not grant exclusivity unless Party C increased its proposed purchase price and showed\nfurther movement on key contractual terms that were open.\nOn August 22, 2022, representatives of Party C contacted representatives of Citi to indicate that Party C\nwas willing to increase its proposed purchase price to $17.75 per share of Class Common Stock in cash, with\na purchase price reduction for any amounts required to be paid to obtain the debt waivers and consents, in\nexchange for a two-week exclusivity period.\nOn August 22, 2022, Cravath sent to Party C\u2019s outside counsel comments to certain provisions of Party\nC\u2019s draft of the Party C Merger Agreement that would need to be accepted for the Company Board to\nconsider granting exclusivity to Party C, including with respect to the specific amounts of termination fees to\nbe payable by the parties to each other under certain circumstances contemplated by the Party C Merger\nAgreement and certain provisions regarding debt defaults, restricted remedies and the debt waivers and\nconsents.\nOn August 23, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior\nmanagement of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Citi, Goldman Sachs and\nBarclays in attendance. Company management provided an update with respect to the WholeCo transaction\nprocess and the negotiations with Party C. Representatives of Citi and Goldman noted that following receipt\nof Party C\u2019s revised bid of $17.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash, Citi had engaged in additional\nprice discovery with Party C as directed by the Company Board and that Party C had indicated it would be\nwilling to increase its bid to $17.75 per share of Class A Common stock in cash, with a purchase price\nreduction for any amounts required to be paid to obtain the debt waivers and consents, in exchange for a\ntwo-week exclusivity period. Members of the Company Board discussed whether to grant exclusivity to Party\nC on that basis.\nMembers of the Company Board continued their discussion from the prior meeting regarding the\nadvantages and risks of continuing to operate as a stand-alone company or pursuing a potential YieldCo\ntransaction given recently increased volatility in the then current macroeconomic environment, continued\nuncertainty surrounding forecasted economic conditions in the near- and long-term, and industry headwinds\nfacing the Company (each of which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial performance),\nparticularly in light of rising inflation and interest rates and challenges that financial sponsors were generally\nencountering in the then current financing markets. A representative of Cravath also provided an overview\n46 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof the status of negotiations on the definitive documentation for a transaction with Party C, noting, among\nother things, that while there remained certain open legal points to negotiate with Party C, such points could\npotentially be resolved during an exclusivity period of approximately two weeks. Following such discussion,\nthe Company Board directed Mr. Berkman, Mr. King and the representatives of Citi and Goldman to drive\nParty C to further increase its proposed purchase and show additional movement on contractual terms, while\ngranting Messrs. Berkman and King and the Company Board\u2019s advisors the authority to negotiate an\nexclusivity agreement with Party C if Party C increased its proposed purchase price to not less than $17.75\nper share of Class A Common Stock.\nLater on August 23, 2022, representatives of Citi and Goldman held a telephone call with representatives\nof Party C to discuss valuation and each of Mr. Berkman and Mr. King held separate telephone calls with\nrepresentatives of Party C to discuss valuation. At the conclusion of the telephone call among Mr. Berkman,\nMr. King and representatives of Party C, the Company and Party C had reached a tentative agreement on a\nrevised purchase price of $18.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash (without a purchase price\nreduction for any amounts required to be paid to obtain the debt waivers and consents) and an agreement to\nenter into a two-week exclusivity period provided the parties could resolve certain other key contractual\nterms, including the specific amounts of termination fees payable under certain circumstances contemplated\nby Party C and the Company and certain issues regarding debt defaults, restricted remedies and the debt\nwaivers and consents. Following the telephone call, representatives of Cravath sent to the representatives of\nParty C\u2019s counsel an initial draft of an exclusivity agreement.\nBetween August 23, 2022 and August 25, 2022, the Company and Party C tentatively agreed on certain\nterms, including the specific amounts of termination fees to be payable by the parties to each other under\ncertain circumstances and representatives of Cravath and Party C\u2019s counsel negotiated the terms of the\nexclusivity agreement, which was entered into by the Company and Party C on August 25, 2022 and provided\nParty C exclusivity until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 9, 2022 (which exclusivity period was\nsubsequently extended by the Company several times, ultimately to October 4, 2022, in light of the parties\u2019\nthen ongoing good faith negotiations of the Party C Merger Agreement as more fully described below).\nOn August 24, 2022, the Transaction Committee and Barclays executed Barclays\u2019 engagement letter.\nOn August 25, 2022, representatives of Citi held a telephone call with representatives of PSP to inform\nPSP that the Company had entered into an exclusivity agreement with another bidder.\nOn September 2, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting with representatives of Morris Nichols\nand Barclays in attendance, at which meeting the Transaction Committee (a) authorized Company\nmanagement to consent to Party C and PSP discussing PSP potentially providing equity financing in\nconnection with Party C\u2019s proposed WholeCo transaction and (b) consented to representatives of Party C\nand Party C\u2019s outside counsel having high-level discussions with certain members of Company management\nand their respective outside counsel, subject to compliance with the June 2022 Guidelines, regarding\npotential terms of rollover arrangements and post-closing employment arrangements that such individuals\nwould consider entering into in connection with Party C\u2019s proposed WholeCo transaction.\nOn September 7, 2022, members of Company management, Ashley Leeds, member of the Company Board\nand Transaction Committee, and representatives of Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morris Nichols, on the one\nhand, and representatives of Party C met for dinner in New York City for introductory purposes. During the\nrest of September 2022 and October 2022, Party C and Party C\u2019s outside counsel, on the one hand, and\ncertain members of Company management and their respective counsel, on the other hand, discussed the\nstructure and principal terms of their potential rollover arrangements.\nOn September 9, 2022, the Company and Citi executed Citi\u2019s engagement letter, and on September 11,\n2022, the Company and Goldman Sachs executed Goldman Sachs\u2019 engagement letter.\nIn September 2022 and October 2022, representatives of Cravath and Party C\u2019s outside counsel\nnegotiated and exchanged drafts of the Party C Merger Agreement, the debt waivers and consents, voting\nand support agreements to be entered into by certain Company Stockholders, the equity commitment letter\nfor Party C\u2019s equity financing and limited guarantee supporting Party C\u2019s obligation to pay a termination fee\nto the Company under certain circumstances contemplated by the Party C Merger Agreement. During this\n47 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nperiod, the Company continued to negotiate the debt waivers and consents with its lenders and Party C\nnegotiated equity financing with PSP and certain other co-investors, as well as debt financing with certain\nother financing sources.\nOn September 26, 2022, EQT submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire the Company for\n$16.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash. EQT indicated to representatives of Citi that it had\ncommitted equity financing from its affiliated funds, but that it also had a desire to explore and evaluate\npotential co-investors.\nOn September 27, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior\nmanagement of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Citi and Goldman Sachs in\nattendance, to discuss the latest developments with Party C and EQT. A representative of Citi noted that the\nCompany had entered into an exclusivity agreement with Party C on the basis of the parties\u2019 tentative\nagreement on a purchase price of $18.00 per share of Class A Common Stock, which had subsequently been\nextended until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 27, 2022 at that time\u037e Company management and the\nCompany Board\u2019s advisors had been working with Party C to resolve open items in the Party C Merger\nAgreement\u037e and Party C had indicated that its three co-investors (including PSP) had also substantially\ncompleted their review of the proposed WholeCo transaction. The representative of Citi also noted that EQT\nhad submitted a proposal on September 26, 2022 to acquire the Company in a WholeCo transaction for $16.00\nper share of Class A Common Stock in cash.\nA representative of Cravath then summarized for the Company Board the open legal issues in the draft\nParty C Merger Agreement that was being negotiated with Party C, highlighted the extensive negotiation that\nhad occurred with respect to provisions regarding debt defaults, restricted remedies and waiver agreements\nduring the exclusivity period. The Company Board discussed whether the existing exclusivity arrangement\nwith Party C should be terminated to permit the Company to explore a potential transaction with EQT. The\nCompany Board considered that, even if the Company were to engage with EQT at this time, it would likely\ntake EQT several additional weeks to advance due diligence and negotiation of definitive documentation to\nstages that were equivalent to what had been achieved with Party C to date at that time\u037e the possibility that\nParty C may reduce its proposed purchase price to amount lower than $18.00 per share of Class A Common\nStock in cash, even if it remained in exclusivity, in light of then current macroeconomic developments, highly\nvolatile financial markets and uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic conditions in the near term and\nthe long term, (each of which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial performance)\u037e and that, even if\nthe Company were not to engage directly in discussions with EQT at that time, the prospect of a competing\nbid could provide an avenue for accelerating the finalization of discussions with Party C and extracting\nadditional concessions on certain key transaction points that remained open for negotiation.\nAfter assessing the advantages and risks, the Company Board directed management to continue\ndiscussions with Party C under exclusivity until October 3, 2022 or October 4, 2022, subject to Company\nmanagement\u2019s discretion, and to try to use the prospect of termination of the exclusivity period to seek\nconcessions from Party C on terms for the definitive documentation.\nOn September 29, 2022, on behalf of the Company, Cravath sent to Party C\u2019s outside counsel a written\nnotice of the Company\u2019s election not to extend the exclusivity period with Party C beyond 11:59 p.m., Eastern\nTime, on October 4, 2022 and that termination of the exclusivity agreement would occur at such time.\nOn October 4, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior\nmanagement of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Citi and Goldman Sachs in\nattendance. The Company Board discussed the latest developments with respect to Party C and EQT.\nRepresentatives of Citi noted that Company management had extended Party C\u2019s exclusivity period until\n11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 4, 2022 and that Citi had explained to Party C that if Party C were unable\nto agree to terms by such time, the Company Board would need to engage with other potential bidders. A\nrepresentative of Cravath noted that Party C had not yet requested an extension of exclusivity and then\nproceeded to summarize for the Company Board the status of the open legal points in the definitive\ndocumentation. The Company Board discussed potential avenues to put further pressure on Party C to\nfinalize terms that did not involve an extension of the exclusivity period and whether to engage with EQT\nupon the termination of the exclusivity period with Party C. At the conclusion of such discussion, the\n48 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany Board determined that the course of action that would be in the best interest of Company\nStockholders would be for the Company to finalize a transaction with Party C at $18.00 per share of Class A\nCommon Stock in cash and to grant Company management the authority to extend exclusivity with Party C, if\nso requested, at its discretion if Company management believed based on ongoing negotiations that such an\nextension would best position the Company to reach that objective. Additionally, the Company Board\ngranted authority to management to reach out to EQT in the event that the exclusivity period with Party C\nterminated.\nAt 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 4, 2022, the exclusivity period with Party C expired and the\nexclusivity agreement terminated pursuant to its terms.\nOn October 6, 2022, representatives of Citi contacted and reengaged with EQT to discuss its revised\nproposal for a WholeCo transaction and to inform EQT that the Company had been exclusive with another\nparty and that while the Company was still engaging with that party in good faith, such engagement was no\nlonger on an exclusive basis. A representative of EQT indicated that EQT remained interested in pursuing a\nWholeCo transaction and would continue to engage in discussions with the Company and its financial and\nlegal advisors regarding a WholeCo transaction, but that EQT was no longer prepared to proceed on the\nbasis of a purchase price for the Company of $16.00 per share of Class A Common Stock.\nOn October 7, 2022, Party C informed the Company and Citi that it was declining to proceed with its\nproposal to acquire the Company in a WholeCo transaction for $18.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in\ncash, in part, due to deterioration in macroeconomic conditions that had occurred since the parties reached a\ntentative agreement on purchase price.\nOn October 23, 2022, a representative of EQT contacted representatives of Citi to schedule a telephone\ncall to discuss EQT\u2019s continued interest in pursuing a WholeCo transaction.

Party C\u2019s outside counsel sent\nto Cravath a revised draft of the Party C Merger Agreement, which Cravath shared with Morris Nichols, and\nrevised drafts of the equity commitment letter for Party C\u2019s equity financing and the limited guarantee.\nOn October 24, 2022, a representative of Citi held telephone calls with representatives of EQT to discuss\npotential next steps regarding EQT\u2019s proposal for a WholeCo transaction, including with respect to due\ndiligence and negotiation of the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents.\nOn October 25, 2022, at the direction of Company management (who had consulted with members of the\nCompany Board and the Transaction Committee), a representative of Citi had a telephone call with a\nrepresentative of Party C to inform Party C that the Company would not continue to engage with Party C on\nthe basis of a WholeCo transaction for $12.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash.\nOn October 26, 2022, EQT\u2019s access to the virtual data room containing information about the Company\nthat had been established in connection with the WholeCo transaction process was reinstated. Also on that\ndate, representatives of Citi held a telephone call with representatives of Party A to discuss their interest in\npursuing a WholeCo transaction.\nOn October 28, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior\nmanagement of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols and Citi in attendance, at which\nmeeting the Company Board discussed the status of each of EQT\u2019s and Party A\u2019s interest in pursuing a\nWholeCo transaction.\nOn October 31, 2022, Company management and representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs, on the one\nhand, and representatives of EQT, on the other hand, held a telephone call to discuss certain due diligence\nmatters regarding a WholeCo transaction.\nOn October 31, 2022, Cravath sent to Simpson a revised draft of the Merger Agreement.\n49 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 3, 2022, Party A informed representatives of Citi that it was declining to submit a written\nproposal for a WholeCo transaction and that, although Party A continued to believe in the potential strategic\nrationale of a combination with the Company, Party A was not prepared to move forward with a transaction\ngiven its preference to use its stock as part of the transaction consideration and the then current market\nprice of its stock.\nOn November 4, 2022, the Company received from EQT a revised written proposal to acquire the\nCompany in a WholeCo transaction for $14.25 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash.

The Company Board\u2019s financial and legal advisors reviewed with the Company Board the latest\nproposal received from EQT, its request for exclusivity and its indication that it may be able to increase its\nproposed purchase price if permitted to include a co-investor. Thereafter, the Company Board discussed\npotential next steps to take with EQT, including with respect to if and when to permit EQT to have\ndiscussions with potential co-investors, and how such next steps could best be deployed to drive EQT to\nincrease its proposed purchase price. Additionally, the Company Board again reviewed the relative merits\nand considerations of pursuing strategic alternatives other than a WholeCo transaction, including\ncontinuing as a stand-alone company, the potential purchase price at which the Company Board may agree\nto a WholeCo transaction given then prevailing market and macroeconomic conditions and whether in light\nof these various considerations it was advisable to continue the WholeCo transaction process given its\npotential to divert Company management\u2019s time and attention from the day-to-day operation of the\nCompany\u2019s business and execution of its other strategic initiatives.\nOn November 8, 2022 and November 9, 2022, representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs, at the direction\nof the Company Board, held telephone calls with representatives of EQT to inform them that if EQT wished to\nproceed with a WholeCo transaction it would need to increase its proposed purchase price and that Citi and\nGoldman Sachs had identified a potential co-investor for EQT.\nOn November 9, 2022, representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs held a telephone call with\nrepresentatives of PSP to inform them the Company was in discussions with a party other than Party C\nregarding a WholeCo transaction and that there may be a potential co-investment opportunity in connection\ntherewith.\nOn November 9, 2022, Street Insider reported that the Company was in discussions with a financial\nsponsor regarding a WholeCo transaction.\nOn November 11, 2022, Mr. Berkman, Mr. Bruce and Mr. Judson, on the one hand, met with\nrepresentatives of PSP, on the other hand, in New York City, to discuss PSP\u2019s interest in engaging in a\ntransaction with the Company.

In light of the Company Board\u2019s\ndirection to continue engaging with EQT in connection with a WholeCo transaction, and given that\nCompany management believed at that time that certain structural features of Party M\u2019s proposed\ntransaction would not constitute an attractive source of funding for the Company to execute on its strategy\nas a stand-alone company and would reduce the Company\u2019s scale, the Company did not engage with Party\nM in connection with Party M\u2019s proposed transaction.\nOn November 30, 2022, Bloomberg reported that the EQT was in talks to acquire the Company.\nOn December 6, 2022, Mr. Berkman and Mr. King and representatives of EQT held a telephone call to\ndiscuss EQT\u2019s proposal for a WholeCo transaction.\nAlso on December 6, 2022, representatives of Cravath and representatives of Simpson and Weil, Gotshal\n& Manges LLP, counsel to PSP (\u201cWeil\u201d), held a telephone call to discuss the debt waiver and consents.\nOn December 7, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior\nmanagement of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols and Citi in attendance, at which\nmeeting the Company Board discussed the latest developments with EQT.

            "text": "Recommendation of the Company Board and Reasons for the Mergers\nRecommendation of the Company Board\nThe Company Board and the Transaction Committee carefully reviewed and considered the terms and conditions\nof the Merger Agreement, including the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Company\nBoard, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Transaction Committee, has unanimously: (a) determined\nthat the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and\nthe Company Stockholders, (b) duly authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company\nof the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the Company of such transactions, (c) declared the Merger\nAgreement and such transactions are advisable and (d) recommended that the Company Stockholders adopt the\nMerger Agreement.\nThe Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e (2)\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Advisory Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nReasons for the Mergers\nAs described in the section titled \u201c- Background of the Mergers\u201d beginning on page 38 of this proxy\nstatement, in evaluating the Mergers, the Company Board held numerous meetings, consulted with and\nreceived the advice of representatives of the Company\u2019s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, held\ndiscussions with the Company\u2019s senior management and considered the business, assets and liabilities,\nresults of operations, financial performance, strategic direction and prospects of the Company. In addition,\nthe Transaction Committee separately evaluated the Mergers, held numerous meetings and consulted with\nand received the advice of representatives of the Transaction Committee\u2019s outside legal counsel and\nfinancial advisor. In making its determination, the Company Board considered a number of factors that it\nbelieved supported its decision to enter into the Merger Agreement and to recommend its adoption by\nCompany Stockholders. In making its determination, the Transaction Committee considered a number of\nfactors that it believed supported its conclusion that the Mergers were in the best interests of the Company\nand Company Stockholders, including its disinterested stockholders, and its decision to recommend that the\nCompany Board adopt the Merger Agreement and the related transactions. These factors included, but were\nnot limited to, the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):\nMerger Consideration\u037e Premium to the Trading Price of Class A Common Stock. The Company Board and\nthe Transaction Committee considered the current and historical market prices of Class A Common\nStock, including the market performance of Class A Common Stock relative to that of other\nparticipants in the Company\u2019s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Merger\nConsideration represented:\na premium of approximately 28.0% based on the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock\nof $11.72 on February 24, 2023, the last full trading day prior to reports that EQT was nearing a\ndeal to acquire the Company\u037e\n55 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\na premium of approximately 13.8% based on the volume weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) per\nshare of Class A Common Stock for the 30 trading-day period ended February 24, 2023 (\u201c30-day\nVWAP\u201d) of $13.18\u037e\na premium of approximately 30.8% based on the VWAP per share of Class A Common Stock for\nthe 90 trading-day period ended February 24, 2023 (\u201c90-day VWAP\u201d) of $11.46\u037e and\na premium of approximately 74.6% based on the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock\nof $8.59 on November 8, 2022, the date Radius announced its third fiscal quarter earnings.\nRisks Relating to Remaining a Standalone Company. The Company Board and the Transaction\nCommittee evaluated the Company\u2019s long-term strategic plan were it to remain an independent public\ncompany, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such plan. This evaluation\nincluded the Company Board\u2019s and the Transaction Committee\u2019s review of the Company\u2019s business,\noperations, financial condition, earnings, prospects, competitive position and the nature of the\nindustry in which the Company competes, including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified)\nof those factors on the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company Board and the\nTransaction Committee ultimately determined that the certainty of value provided by the acquisition\nof the Company by Parent for the Merger Consideration was more favorable to Company\nStockholders than the risk-adjusted value of remaining an independent public company, after\naccounting for the risks and uncertainties that the Company would face if it continued to operate on a\nstandalone public company basis, as described under the section of this proxy statement titled\n\u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nCash Consideration\u037e Certainty of Value. The Company Board and the Transaction Committee\nconsidered the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, which will provide Company\nStockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Company Capital Stock,\nenables Company Stockholders to realize value that has been created by Radius and does not expose\nthem to any future risks related to the business or macroeconomic conditions, as compared to Radius\nremaining independent.\nNo Financing Condition and Committed Equity Financing. The Company Board and the Transaction\nCommittee considered the fact that the Mergers are not subject to a financing condition, the\nSponsors have committed to make available and provide to Parent, pursuant to equity commitment\nletters, the full amount in cash necessary, together with available cash on hand at the Company of not\nless than $210,000,000 and the Rollover Amount, to pay the amounts required to be paid in\nconnection with, or as a result of, the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Company Board and the Transaction Committee also\nconsidered the fact that the Sponsors have provided termination equity commitment letters in favor of\nParent to fund its obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee that may become payable to the\nCompany under certain circumstances, as described in more detail under the section of this proxy\nstatement titled \u201c- Financing of the Mergers\u201d.\nBenefits of an Acquisition by Financial Sponsors. The Company Board and the Transaction Committee\nconsidered the possibility that an infrastructure fund or other private financial sponsor might be able\nto realize more value from the business than a public company buyer and thereby pay a higher price\nto acquire the Company, including the ability to absorb near-term dilution from (a) potential equity\ncapital required to fund growth and (b) capital expenditures in favor of longer-term growth and to\nfund developments without having to rely on the volatility of equity capital markets. For a detailed\ndiscussion of the Company Board\u2019s and the Transaction Committee\u2019s assessment of potential\ncounterparties, please see above under the heading titled \u201c- Background of the Mergers\u201d.\nThe Company\u2019s Operating and Financial Condition and Prospects. The Company Board and the\nTransaction Committee considered the Company\u2019s operating and financial performance and its\nprospects, including certain prospective forecasts for the Company prepared by the Company\u2019s\nsenior management, which reflect an application of various assumptions of senior management. The\nCompany Board and the Transaction Committee considered the challenges that senior management\nface in creating prospective forecasts (due to the difficulties associated with predicting the amount\n56 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof future acquisitions and the prices to be paid for such acquisitions) and the inherent uncertainty of\nachieving such prospective forecasts, as set forth under the heading titled \u201c- Certain Financial\nForecasts\u201d, and that as a result, the Company\u2019s actual financial results in future periods could differ\nmaterially from senior management\u2019s forecasts.\nBest Alternative for Maximizing Company Stockholder Value. After a review of a range of alternatives\nand discussions with management and the Company\u2019s financial and legal advisors, the Company\nBoard and the Transaction Committee determined that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to\nthe Company Stockholders than the potential value that might result from other options available,\nincluding, but not limited to, remaining a standalone public company or pursuing a YieldCo\ntransaction (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201c- Background of the Mergers\u201d).\nAs part of these evaluations, the Company Board and the Transaction Committee considered an\nassessment of the Company\u2019s business, assets, prospects, competitive position, historical and\nprojected financial performance, short- and long-term capital needs and the nature of the industries in\nwhich the Company competes as well as the significant risks and uncertainties associated with\nremaining a standalone public company.\nDual-Track Process. The Company Board and the Transaction Committee considered its dual-track\nprocess for soliciting and responding to offers from third parties that were believed to be the most\nwilling and able to pay the highest price for a minority investment in the case of a YieldCo transaction\nor the Company in the case of an acquisition of the Company, which included providing such parties\nwith an opportunity to conduct due diligence and conduct management sessions with members of the\nCompany\u2019s management, as described in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201c- Background of\nthe Mergers\u201d.\nCiti\u2019s, Goldman Sachs\u2019 and Barclays\u2019 Fairness Opinions and Related Financial Analyses. The Company\nBoard and the Transaction Committee, as applicable, considered:\nthe financial analysis reviewed and discussed with the Company Board by representatives of\nCiti, and the oral opinion rendered by Citi to the Company Board, which was subsequently\nconfirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date\nof Citi\u2019s written opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi\nas set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of\nshares of Class A Common Stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders\u037e\nthe financial analysis reviewed and discussed with the Company Board by representatives of\nGoldman Sachs, and the oral opinion rendered by Goldman Sachs to the Company Board, which\nwas subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the effect\nthat, as of the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion and based on and subject to the factors\nand assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other\nthan Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders\u037e and\nthe financial analysis reviewed and discussed with the Transaction Committee by\nrepresentatives of Barclays, and the oral opinion of Barclays, which was subsequently confirmed\nin writing, to the Transaction Committee that, as of the date of Barclays\u2019 opinion and based upon\nand subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, from a\nfinancial point of view, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of\nClass A Common Stock (other than the executive officers of the Company and the Excluded\nStockholders) in the Mergers is fair to such holders.\nFor more information, see the sections beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement titled \u201c-",

In connection with Citi\u2019s engagement, the Company Board requested that Citi evaluate the fairness,\nfrom a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock of the Merger\nConsideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in\nthe Merger Agreement. On March 1, 2023, at a meeting of the Company Board held to evaluate the proposed\nMergers, Citi rendered to the Company Board an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a\nwritten opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of Citi\u2019s written opinion and based on\nand subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and\nqualifications on the review undertaken by Citi as set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration\nto be received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to\nsuch holders.\nThe full text of Citi\u2019s written opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the Board, which sets forth, among other\nthings, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on\nthe review undertaken by Citi in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is\nincorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The summary of Citi\u2019s opinion set forth below is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the full text of Citi\u2019s opinion. Citi\u2019s opinion was rendered to the Board (in its\ncapacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Mergers and was limited to the fairness,\nfrom a financial point of view, as of the date of Citi\u2019s written opinion, to holders of shares of Class A\nCommon Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the terms and\nsubject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Citi\u2019s opinion did not address any other terms,\naspects or implications of the proposed Mergers. Citi\u2019s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of\nRadius to effect or enter into the proposed Mergers, the relative merits of the proposed Mergers as compared to any\nalternative business strategies that might have existed for Radius or the effect of any other transaction in which\nRadius might have engaged or considered. Citi\u2019s opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a\nrecommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the\nproposed Mergers or otherwise.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Citi:\nreviewed a draft, dated March 1, 2023, of the Merger Agreement\u037e\nheld discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of\nRadius concerning the business, operations and prospects of Radius\u037e\nexamined certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Radius as well as\nthe December 31, 2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts and other information and data relating to\nRadius that were provided to or discussed with Citi by the management of Radius\u037e\n62 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreviewed the financial terms of the Mergers as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to, among\nother things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes of Class A Common Stock, the\nhistorical and projected earnings and other operating data of Radius, and the capitalization and\nfinancial condition of Radius\u037e\nat the direction of Radius, approached and held discussions with, third parties to solicit indications of\ninterest in the possible acquisition of Radius\u037e and\nconducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and\nfinancial, economic and market criteria as Citi deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.\nThe issuance of Citi\u2019s opinion was authorized by Citi\u2019s fairness opinion committee.\nIn rendering its opinion, Citi assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy\nand completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or\notherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citi and upon the assurances of the management of Radius that\nthey were not aware of any relevant information that was omitted or that remained undisclosed to Citi. With\nrespect to financial forecasts and other information and data relating to Radius provided to or otherwise\nreviewed by or discussed with Citi, Citi was advised by the management of Radius, and Citi assumed, with\nthe consent of the Company Board, that such financial forecasts and other information and data were\nreasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments\nof the management of Radius as to, and are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate, the future financial\nperformance of Radius and the other matters covered thereby. Citi expressed no view or opinion as to any\nfinancial forecasts and other information or data (or underlying assumptions on which any such financial\nforecasts and other information or data are based) provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with\nCiti.\nCiti had assumed, with the consent of the Company Board, that the Mergers will be consummated in\naccordance with the terms, conditions and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, without waiver,\nmodification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining\nthe necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases for the Mergers, no\ndelay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Radius or the\nMergers or that otherwise would be meaningful to Citi\u2019s opinion or analysis. Representatives of Radius had\nadvised Citi, and Citi further assumed, with the consent of the Company Board, that the final terms of the\nMerger Agreement would not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by Citi. Citi had not\nmade or been provided with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent,\naccrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of Radius or any other entity nor had Citi made any\nphysical inspection of the properties or assets of Radius or any other entity.

Citi also did not express any view or opinion as to the prices at\nwhich the Class A Common Stock or any other securities would trade or otherwise be transferable at any\ntime, including following the announcement of the Mergers. Citi did not express any view or opinion with\nrespect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters, including, without limitation, as to tax or other\nconsequences of the Mergers or otherwise or changes in, or the impact of, accounting standards or tax and\nother laws, regulations and governmental and legislative policies affecting Radius or the Mergers (including\nthe contemplated benefits thereof), and Citi relied, with the consent of the Company Board, upon the\nassessments of representatives of Radius as to such matters.\nCiti\u2019s opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of its written\nopinion, of the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant\nto the Merger Agreement, without regard to individual circumstances of holders of the Class A Common\nStock that may distinguish such holders or the securities of Radius held by such holders, and did not\naddress any other terms, aspects or implications of the Mergers, including, without limitation, the form or\nstructure of the Mergers and the Rollover Agreements and any consideration payable in connection\ntherewith, the allocation of the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement among\nthe holders of, or the treatment or cancellation for no consideration of, the various types of shares of capital\nstock of Radius or any of its subsidiaries, or any terms, aspects or implications of any agreement,\narrangement or understanding to be entered into or amended or modified in connection with or\n63 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncontemplated by the Mergers, or the amount thereof relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Citi\nexpressed no view as to, and Citi\u2019s opinion did not address, the underlying business decision of Radius to\neffect or enter into the Mergers, the relative merits of the Mergers as compared to any alternative business\nstrategies that might exist for Radius or the effect of any other transaction in which Radius might engage or\nconsider. Citi also expressed no view as to, and Citi\u2019s opinion did not address, the fairness (financial or\notherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation or other consideration to any\nofficers, directors or employees of any parties to the Mergers, or any class of such persons, relative to the\nMerger Consideration or otherwise. Citi\u2019s opinion is necessarily based upon information available to Citi,\nand financial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing and disclosed to Citi, as of the\ndate of its written opinion. Although subsequent developments may affect Citi\u2019s opinion, Citi has no\nobligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. As the Company Board was aware, the credit, financial\nand stock markets, the industries in which Radius operates and the securities of Radius have experienced\nand may continue to experience volatility and Citi expressed no view or opinion as to any potential effects of\nsuch volatility on Radius or the Mergers (including the contemplated benefits thereof).\nIn preparing its opinion, Citi performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those\ndescribed below. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various\ndeterminations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of\nthose methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to\npartial analysis or summary description. Citi arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses\nundertaken by it and factors assessed as a whole, and it did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with\nregard to any one factor or method of analysis for purposes of its opinion.\nIn its analyses, Citi considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions and other matters existing as of the date of its written opinion, many of which are beyond the\ncontrol of Radius. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to\nRadius or the Mergers and an evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical\u037e rather, the analyses\ninvolve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other\nfactors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or\ntransactions reviewed or the results of any particular analysis.\nThe estimates used by Citi for purposes of its analyses and the valuation ranges resulting from any\nparticular analysis were not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses. In addition,\nanalyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the\nprices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in,\nand the results derived from, Citi\u2019s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nCiti was not requested to, and it did not, recommend or determine the specific consideration payable in\nthe proposed Mergers. The type and amount of consideration payable in the proposed Mergers were\ndetermined through negotiations Radius, on the one hand, and Parent and its affiliates, on the other hand,\nand Radius\u2019 decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board. Citi\u2019s opinion was\nonly one of many factors considered by the Company Board in its evaluation of the proposed Mergers and\nshould not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Company Board or the management of Radius with\nrespect to the proposed Mergers, the Merger Consideration or any other aspect of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nFinancial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared for and reviewed with the\nCompany Board in connection with Citi\u2019s opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the Company Board. The summary\nset forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by, and underlying the\nopinion of, Citi, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight\ngiven to those financial analyses by Citi. Certain financial analyses summarized below include information presented\nin tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of\neach summary as the tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the\ndata in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the\nmethodologies and assumptions underlying the financial\n64 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial analyses. Future results may be different from\nthose described and such differences may be material. Approximate implied equity value per share reference\nranges derived from the financial analyses described below and other per share ranges presented for\nreference purposes only were rounded to the nearest $0.05, except for data relating to intraday trading share\nprices. Except as otherwise noted, financial data utilized for Radius in the financial analyses described below\nwere based on the December 31, 2023\u202f-\u202f2032 Management Forecasts as indicated and other information and\ndata relating to Radius provided to or discussed with Citi and approved for Citi\u2019s use by the Company Board\nand as further summarized in the section titled \u201c- Certain Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 81.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nCiti conducted a discounted cash flow analysis of Radius using the December 31, 2023\u202f-\u202f2032\nManagement Forecasts (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201c- Certain Financial\nForecasts\u201d), in which Citi calculated the estimated present value (as of December 31, 2022) of the standalone\nunlevered after-tax free cash flows that Radius was forecasted to generate during calendar year 2023 through\ncalendar year 2032 as reflected in the December 31, 2023\u202f-\u202f2032 Management Forecasts. For purposes of this\nanalysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Based on its professional judgment and\nexperience, Citi calculated terminal values for Radius at the end of the projection period by applying a\nselected range of perpetuity growth rates of 3.00% to 3.50% (which Citi derived by utilizing its professional\njudgment and experience and taking into consideration, among other factors, Radius management\u2019s views\nregarding future growth, as well as long-term growth expectations for the industry and trend in the overall\neconomy generally) to the standalone unlevered after-tax fee cash flows of Radius in the terminal year as\nreflected in the December 31, 2023\u202f-\u202f2032 Management Forecasts. Citi then discounted to present value (as of\nDecember 31, 2022) the standalone unlevered after-tax free cash flows and implied estimated terminal value\nusing discount rates ranging from 7.90% to 8.60%, derived from a calculation of the weighted average cost of\ncapital of Radius, which Citi performed utilizing the capital asset pricing model with inputs that Citi\ndetermined were relevant based on publicly available data and Citi\u2019s professional judgment. This analysis\nindicated an implied firm value reference range for Radius of approximately $1,913 million to $3,072 million.\nFrom this range of implied firm values, Citi subtracted Radius\u2019 net debt as of December 31, 2022 (calculated\nas debt less cash) and the present value as of December 31, 2022 of Series A Founder Preferred Stock implied\nannual dividends calculated by Citi based on theoretical future prices for the shares of Class A Common\nStock calculated by Citi at a cap rate of 5.9% as described in the section below titled \u201c- Present Value of\nFuture Share Price Analysis\u201d and discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from 7.90% to\n8.60%, and divided the results by the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding on a fully\ndiluted basis as of February 28, 2023, calculated using the treasury stock method, based on information\nprovided by Radius management. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity\nvalue reference range for Radius, as compared to the Merger Consideration:\nImplied per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nMerger\nConsideration\n$5.95\u202f-\u202f$15.95\n$15.00\nPresent Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nCiti performed an analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Class A Common\nStock as of December 31, 2022 based on theoretical future prices calculated by Citi for the shares of Class A\nCommon Stock based on the December 31, 2023\u202f-\u202f2032 Management Forecasts. Citi derived a range of\ntheoretical future values per share for the shares of Class A Common Stock as of December 31 of each of\ncalendar years 2023 through 2032 by applying illustrative cap rates of 5.2% to 5.9% to estimates of the\nadjusted annualized in-place rent of Radius for each of calendar years 2023 through 2032, as reflected in the\nDecember 31, 2023\u202f-\u202f2032 Management Forecasts. The cap rates used by Citi were derived based on Citi\u2019s\nprofessional judgment and experience and reflected the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, of Radius\u2019\ntrading cap rates on annualized in-place rent during the twelve-month period ended February 24, 2023. By\napplying a discount rate of 12.1%, reflecting a mid-point estimate of Radius\u2019 cost of equity, Citi discounted to\npresent value as of December 31, 2022 the theoretical future values per share it derived for Radius as\ndescribed above, to yield a range of illustrative present values per share of Class A Common Stock. This\n65 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Radius, as\ncompared to the Merger Consideration.\nImplied per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nMerger\nConsideration\n$9.90\u202f-\u202f$15.95\n$15.00\nOther Information\nCiti observed certain other information with respect to Radius that was not considered part of its\nfinancial analyses with respect to its opinion, but was noted for reference purposes only, including the\nfollowing:\nHistorical Stock Trading. Citi reviewed historical intraday trading prices of Class A Common Stock for the\n52-week period ended February 24, 2023, which indicated an overall low to high intraday trading share\nprice range of $7.97 to $16.52 per share over the period.\nPrecedent Premiums Paid. Citi reviewed publicly available data relating to premiums paid in all-cash U.S.\npublicly traded company transactions announced between 2012 and 2022, with transaction values between\n$1 billion and $10 billion (excluding transactions involving financial institutions as targets). Citi applied a\nselected range of one-day premiums of 20% to 40% (derived, based on Citi\u2019s professional judgment and\nexperience, from the premiums paid in such transactions over the target companies involved in such\ntransactions unaffected closing stock price) to (a) to the closing price of Class A Common Stock of $11.72\nper share on February 24, 2023, and (ii) to the closing price of Class A Common Stock of $8.59 per share on\nNovember 8, 2022, the closing price prior to Radius\u2019 third fiscal quarter earnings announcement date, imply\napproximate per share equity value reference ranges for Radius of (i) $14.05 to $16.40 per share, and (ii)\n$10.30 to $12.05 per share, respectively.\nMiscellaneous\nRadius has agreed to pay Citi for its services in connection with the Mergers an aggregate fee of\napproximately $21,300,000, of which $2,500,000 was payable upon delivery of Citi\u2019s opinion to the Company\nBoard and the remainder is payable contingent upon consummation of the Mergers. The Company may pay\nCiti an additional discretionary fee of up to $5,000,000 based upon the Company Board\u2019s assessment of Citi\u2019s\nwork in connection with its engagement. In addition, Radius agreed to reimburse Citi for Citi\u2019s reasonable\nexpenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, and to indemnify Citi and related parties against certain\nliabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws, arising out of Citi\u2019s engagement.\nAs the Company Board was aware, although Citi and its affiliates have not provided investment\nbanking, commercial banking, capital raising or other similar financial services to Radius and/or its affiliates\nunrelated to the proposed Mergers during the past two years for which Citi and its affiliates received\ncompensation, Citi and its affiliates in the future may provide such services to Radius and/or its affiliates, for\nwhich services Citi and its affiliates would expect to receive compensation. As the Company Board was also\naware, Citi and its affiliates in the past have provided, and currently are providing, investment banking,\ncommercial banking and other similar financial services to EQT and its affiliates and controlled portfolio\ncompanies, for which services Citi and its affiliates have received and expect to receive compensation,\nincluding, without limitation, during the two-year period prior to the date of Citi\u2019s written opinion, having\nacted as financial advisor in connection with certain merger and acquisition transactions involving\ncontrolled portfolio companies of EQT, as bookrunner or arranger in connection with certain bond issuances,\nloans and credit facilities of controlled portfolio companies of EQT, as ratings advisor to a controlled\nportfolio company of EQT and as lender in connection with certain loans of EQT. For the services described\nabove for EQT and its affiliates, Citi and its affiliates received, during the two-year period prior to the date of\nCiti\u2019s written opinion, aggregate fees of approximately $12 million, as determined by Citi based on its books\nand records. As the Company Board was also aware, Citi and its affiliates in the past have provided, and\ncurrently are providing, investment banking, commercial banking and other similar financial services to PSP\nand its affiliates and controlled portfolio companies, for which services Citi and its affiliates have received\nand expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two-year period prior to the\ndate of Citi\u2019s written opinion, having acted as joint lead arranger and bookrunner in connection with certain\nbond offerings and as lender in connection with certain loans of PSP and its affiliates. For the services\ndescribed\n66 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nabove for PSP and its affiliates, Citi and its affiliates received, during the two-year period prior to the date of\nCiti\u2019s written opinion, aggregate fees of approximately $1 million, as determined by Citi based on its books\nand records. In the ordinary course of Citi\u2019s business, Citi and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the\nsecurities of Radius for Citi\u2019s own account or for the account of Citi\u2019s customers and, accordingly, may at\nany time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, Citi and its affiliates (including\nCitigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with Radius and its affiliates.\nRadius selected Citi to act as lead financial advisor in connection with the proposed Mergers based on\nCiti\u2019s reputation, experience and familiarity with Radius and its businesses.

            "text": "Opinion of Goldman Sachs\nGoldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Company Board that, as of March 1, 2023 and based upon\nand subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the\nholders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 1, 2023, which sets forth assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is\nattached as Annex C. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of\nthe Company Board in connection with its consideration of the Mergers. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion is not a\nrecommendation as to how any holder of Class A Common Stock should vote with respect to the Mergers, or any other\nmatter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses,\nGoldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Radius for the two years ended\nDecember 31, 2021\u037e\nRadius\u2019 Registration Statement on Form S-4, including the prospectus contained therein dated\nOctober 5, 2020 relating, among other things, to the issuance of Class A Common Stock\u037e\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Radius and certain\nother communications from Radius to Company Stockholders\u037e\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for Radius\u037e and\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as\napproved by the Company for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use, including the December 31, 2023 - 2032\nManagement Forecasts, (referenced in this section of the proxy statement titled \u201c- Opinion of\nGoldman Sachs\u201d as the \u201cForecasts\u201d). See the section titled \u201c- Certain Financial Forecasts\u201d.\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Radius regarding their\nassessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Radius\u037e\nreviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Class A Common Stock\u037e compared certain\nfinancial and stock market information for Radius with similar information for certain other companies the\nsecurities of which are publicly traded\u037e reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations\nin the technology, media and telecommunications (\u201cTMT\u201d) industry\u037e and performed such other studies and\nanalyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Company Board, relied\nupon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting\nand other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for\nindependent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent\n67 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nof the Company Board that the Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then\ncurrently available estimates and judgments of the management of Radius. Goldman Sachs did not make an\nindependent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or\nother off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Radius or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished\nwith any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other\nconsents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Mergers will be obtained without any\nadverse effect on the expected benefits of the Mergers in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs\nalso assumed that the Mergers will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without\nthe waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its\nanalysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Radius to engage in the\nMergers or the relative merits of the Mergers as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available\nto Radius\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\naddresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates)\nof Class A Common Stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such\nholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not express any view on, and does\nnot address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Mergers or any term or aspect of any\nother agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in\nconnection with the Mergers, including the allocation of the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement among the holders of, or the cancellation for no consideration of, the various types of\nshares of Company Capital Stock or any of its subsidiaries, the OpCo Merger and the Rollover Agreements\nand any consideration payable in connection therewith, and the fairness of the Mergers to, or any\nconsideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities (including the\nSeries A Founder Preferred Stock, the OpCo Common Units and the Rollover Equity), creditors, or other\nconstituencies of Radius\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or\npayable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Radius, or class of such persons in connection with\nthe Mergers, whether relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and\nits affiliates) of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on,\nand the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs\nassumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances,\ndevelopments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express\nany opinion as to the prices at which shares of Class A Common Stock will trade at any time, as to the\npotential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Radius, Parent or the Mergers, or as\nto the impact of the Mergers on the solvency or viability of Radius or Parent or the ability of Radius or\nParent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs\u2019 advisory services and\nopinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Company Board in connection with its\nconsideration of the Mergers and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder\nof shares of Class A Common Stock should vote or act with respect to such Mergers or any other matter.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.\nSummary of Material Financial Analysis\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the\nCompany Board in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary,\nhowever, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman\nSachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those\nanalyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented\nin tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a\ncomplete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following\nquantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on\nor before February 28, 2023, the last trading day before the public announcement of the Mergers, and is not\nnecessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nUsing the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Radius\nto derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Class A Common Stock. For purposes of this\n68 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Using the mid-year convention for\ndiscounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 7.9% to 8.7%, reflecting estimates of Radius\u2019\nweighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value, as of December 31, 2022, (i)\nestimates of unlevered free cash flow for Radius for the calendar years 2023 through 2032, as reflected in the\nForecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Radius, which were calculated by applying\nterminal growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow\nto be generated by Radius, as reflected in the Forecasts (which analysis implied annualized in-place rent\nyield of 5.5% to 7.1%). The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its\nprofessional judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding\nlong-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates\nby application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (\u201cCAPM\u201d), which requires certain company-specific\ninputs, including Radius\u2019 target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on\npermanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Radius, as well as\ncertain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Radius by adding the ranges of\npresent values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then derived a range of illustrative equity values for Radius\nby subtracting from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Radius (i) the net debt of Radius\nas of December 31, 2022 (calculated as debt less cash), as provided and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by\nthe management of Radius and (ii) the present value, as of December 31, 2022, of Series A Founder Preferred\nStock implied annual dividends calculated by Goldman Sachs based on theoretical future prices for the\nshares of Class A Common Stock which were calculated by Goldman Sachs using the Forecasts by applying\na constant cap rate of 6.2% to estimates of Radius\u2019 annualized in-place rent for each of calendar years 2022\nthrough 2026 using the methodology described in the section below titled \u201c-\u200bIllustrative Present Value of\nFuture Share Price Analysis\u201d and using discount rates ranging from 7.9% to 8.7%, reflecting estimates of\nRadius\u2019 weighted average cost of capital. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values\nit derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock as of February 28,\n2023, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Radius, using the treasury\nstock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Class A Common Stock ranging\nfrom $5.35 to $16.11.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nUsing the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of\nan illustrative future value per share of Class A Common Stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs calculated\nthe implied enterprise value of Radius as of December 31 for each of calendar years 2022 through 2025, by\napplying illustrative cap rates ranging from 4.8% to 6.2% to estimates of Radius\u2019 annualized in-place rent for\neach of the calendar years 2022 through 2025. This illustrative range of cap rates was derived by Goldman\nSachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical cap rates\non annualized in-place rent for Radius. Goldman Sachs then subtracted the net debt of Radius for each of\ncalendar years 2022 through 2025 (calculated as debt less cash), as provided by and approved for Goldman\nSachs\u2019 use by the management of Radius, from the respective implied enterprise values in order to derive a\nrange of illustrative equity values as of December 31 for Radius for each of calendar years 2022 through\n2025. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully\ndiluted outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock each of calendar years 2022 through 2025, calculated\nusing information provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Radius, to\nderive a range of implied future values per share of Class A Common Stock. For purposes of this analysis,\nboth stock-based compensation expense and the Series A Founder Preferred Stock annual dividends were\ntreated as share issuances.\nGoldman Sachs then discounted these implied future equity values per share of Class A Common Stock\nto December 31, 2025 using an illustrative discount rate of 11%, reflecting an estimate of Radius\u2019 cost of\nequity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain\ncompany-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United\nStates financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of illustrative present values per share of\nClass A Common Stock of $11.42 to $19.51.\n69 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPremia Paid Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for\nall-cash acquisition transactions announced during the period from January 1, 2013 through February 24,\n2023 involving a public company in the TMT sector based in the United States as the target where the\ndisclosed enterprise value for the transaction was greater than $1 billion. For the entire period, using\npublicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile premia\nof the price paid in the 149 transactions relative to the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to\nannouncement of the transaction and the target\u2019s highest closing stock price during the 52-week period prior\nto the date of the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price. With respect to the target\u2019s last undisturbed\nclosing stock price prior to the announcement of the transaction, this analysis indicated an overall premium\nof 28%, and a 25th percentile premium of 19% and 75th percentile premium of 46% across the entire period.\nWith respect to the target\u2019s last undisturbed 52-week high closing stock price prior to the announcement of\nthe transaction, this analysis indicated an overall premium of 6%, and a 25th percentile premium of negative\n5% and 75th percentile premium of 17% across the entire period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied\na reference range of illustrative premia of 19% to 46% to the undisturbed closing price per share of Class A\nCommon Stock of $11.72 as of February 24, 2023 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of\nClass A Common Stock of $13.95 to $17.11.\nHistorical Stock Trading Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices for shares of Class A Common Stock for the period\nbeginning January 1, 2022 and ending February 28, 2023. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the Merger\nConsideration to be paid to holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Class A Common Stock\npursuant to the Merger Agreement in relation to (i) the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock on\nFebruary 24, 2023, (ii) the high and low closing price per share of Class A Common Stock for the 52-week\nperiod ended February 24, 2023, (iii) the 30-day VWAP, (iv) the 90-day VWAP, and (v) the closing price per\nshare of Class A Common Stock on November 8, 2022, the date Radius announced its third fiscal quarter\nearnings.\nThis analysis indicated that the price per share to be paid to holders of shares of Class A Common Stock\npursuant to the Merger Agreement represented:\na premium of approximately 28.0% based on the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock of\n$11.72 on February 24, 2023\u037e\na premium of approximately 13.8% based on the 30-day VWAP per share of Class A Common Stock of\n$13.18\u037e\na premium of approximately 30.8% based on the 90-day VWAP per share of Class A Common Stock of\n$11.46\u037e and\na premium of approximately 74.6% based on the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock of\n$8.59 on November 8, 2022, the date Radius announced its third fiscal quarter earnings.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial\nanalysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above,\nwithout considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all\nof its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,\nGoldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional\njudgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above\nanalyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Radius or the contemplated transaction.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the\nCompany Board as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the Merger Consideration to be paid to\nthe holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices\n70 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nat which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are\nnot necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based\nupon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of\nRadius, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different\nfrom those forecasts.\nThe Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Radius and\nParent and was approved by the Company Board. Goldman Sachs did not recommend any specific amount of\nconsideration to Radius or the Company Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the\nonly appropriate consideration for the Mergers.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Company Board was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the Company Board in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The\nforegoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman\nSachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written\nopinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending and financing, principal\ninvesting, sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial\nactivities and services for various persons and entities.

The Capped Call Transactions consisted of the purchase by Radius of capped call options with\nrespect to, collectively, approximately 11,693,201 shares of Class A Common Stock, the aggregate number of\nshares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Convertible Notes (at the initial conversion rate of 44.2087\nshares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 in principal amount of the Convertible Notes) (with 40%\npurchased from Goldman Sachs). The Convertible Notes had an initial strike price equal to $22.62 per share of\nClass A Common Stock, subject to an initial cap price of $34.80 per share of Class A Common Stock. As of\nMay [\u2022], 2023 100% of the Capped Call Transactions remain outstanding, with a strike price of $22.62 per\nshare of Class A Common Stock and a cap price of $34.80 per share of Class A Common Stock.\nThe Capped Call Transactions were intended to offset a portion of the potential dilutive effect on\nCompany Stockholders of the conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or any potential cash payment in\nexcess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes that Radius may make in connection with a cash\nsettlement of the Convertible Notes, in each case, up to the cap price. The Capped Call Transactions, upon\nthe exercise thereof, generally require the capped call counterparties to deliver to Radius a number of shares\nof Class A Common Stock (and/or in certain circumstances, at Radius\u2019 election, cash) determined based on\nthe excess, if any, of the lower of the cap price and the price of the shares of Class A Common Stock at that\ntime (determined over a period specified in the Capped Call Transactions) over the strike price per share of\nClass A Common Stock.\nThe Capped Call Transactions may be adjusted, exercised, cancelled and/or terminated in accordance\nwith their terms in connection with certain events, including the announcement or consummation of the\nMergers, which could result in a payment from Goldman Sachs to Radius. In particular, under the terms of the\nCapped Call Transactions, each of Goldman Sachs and the other capped call counterparties, each acting\nseparately as calculation agent under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, is entitled in certain\ncircumstances to make adjustments to the cap price of the call options to reflect the economic effect of the\nannouncement of such events (including the Mergers) on the Capped Call Transactions. In addition, each of\nGoldman Sachs and the other capped call counterparties may, each acting separately as the calculation\nagent, determining party or otherwise as principal under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party,\ndetermine such adjustments in respect of such Capped Call Transactions in accordance with their terms,\nincluding on or following consummation or abandonment of such events. In its capacity as\n72 \nsm\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncalculation agent, all actions or exercises of judgment by Goldman Sachs pursuant to the terms of the\nCapped Call Transactions to which it is a party must be performed in good faith and a commercially\nreasonable manner.\nAs a result of the Capped Call Transactions, the capped call counterparties are expected to have market\nexposure to the price of the shares of Class A Common Stock. It is ordinary practice of the capped call\ncounterparties to engage in hedging activities to limit their respective market exposure to the price of the\nstock underlying privately negotiated equity derivative transactions with issuers of such stock, such as the\nCapped Call Transactions. In connection with the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, Goldman\nSachs (and its affiliates) have engaged, and will continue to engage, in accordance with applicable law in\nhedging and other market transactions (which may include the entering into or unwinding of various\nderivative transactions with respect to Class A Common Stock) that are generally intended to substantially\nneutralize Goldman Sachs\u2019 exposure as a result of the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party to\nchanges in the price per share of Class A Common Stock. Such hedging activity is at Goldman Sachs\u2019 own\nrisk and may result in a gain or loss to Goldman Sachs that may be greater than or less than the initial\nexpected contractual benefit to Goldman Sachs under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party. The\namount of any such gain or loss will not be known until the applicable Capped Call Transactions have been\nexercised, expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs shall have completed all\nof its hedge unwind activities. To mitigate the exposure from the Capped Call Transactions, as of May [\u2022],\n2023, Goldman Sachs held a net long economic position of approximately one million shares of Class A\nCommon Stock and was long and short a number of various other options on Class A Common Stock.\nGoldman Sachs provided to management of Radius, for the information of the Company Board, materials\nthat summarized, based on theoretical models, the potential effects of the announcement and of the\nconsummation of an acquisition of Radius on the Capped Call Transactions to which Goldman Sachs is a\ncounterparty. The materials included preliminary illustrative analyses by Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment\nBanking Division for a range of stated assumptions regarding takeout prices for shares of Class A Common\nStock and volatilities, as well as based on other reasonable assumptions. In accordance with industry\npractice, Goldman Sachs maintains customary institutional information barriers reasonably designed to\nprevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by personnel in its Investment Banking\nDivision to the personnel in its Securities Division who are undertaking hedging and other market\ntransactions with respect to Goldman Sachs\u2019 Capped Call Transactions. In connection with the preparation of\npresentations to senior management of Radius and the Company Board, personnel in Goldman Sachs\u2019\nInvestment Banking Division, including the representatives of Goldman Sachs who have advised Radius in\nconnection with the Mergers, from time to time, have received or may receive input from personnel in\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 Securities Division into how to model, or reports of historical measures or estimates of,\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 and/or Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division\u2019s profit and/or loss over certain\nmeasurement periods related to the Capped Call Transactions.\nGoldman Sachs has advised Radius that as of May [\u2022], 2023, Goldman Sachs expects to realize a net gain\nof up to approximately $7 million with respect to the Capped Call Transactions as a result of the merger, after\ngiving effect to its hedging activities based on the ordinary hedging practices described above and based on\na range of stated assumptions, including volatilities and other reasonable assumptions. The amount of any\nsuch gain will not be known until the Capped Call Transactions have been exercised, expired or terminated in\naccordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs and its affiliates have completed all of their unwind\nactivities, and such amount may differ from the estimates provided above.\nThe indenture governing the Convertible Notes and the forms of confirmations containing the terms of\nthe Capped Call Transactions were included as exhibits to Radius\u2019 Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the\nSEC on September 7, 2021, which contains additional disclosure regarding the Convertible Notes and a\ndescription of the Capped Call Transactions. All references in this section of this proxy statement to share\ncounts, conversion prices, cap prices and strike prices are subject to adjustment from time to time in\naccordance with the terms of the confirmations relating to the Capped Call Transactions.\nThe Company Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally\nrecognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Mergers.\nPursuant to a letter agreement dated September 11, 2022, Radius engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its\n73",

            "text": "Opinion of Barclays\nThe Transaction Committee engaged Barclays to act as its financial advisor in connection with\nevaluating a strategic transaction outside of the Company\u2019s ordinary course of business, including a\npossible sale of the Company, pursuant to an engagement letter dated August 24, 2022. On March 1, 2023,\nBarclays rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the Transaction\nCommittee that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and\nassumptions stated in its opinion, from a financial point of view, the Merger Consideration to be received by\nthe holders of shares of Class A Common Stock (other than the executive officers of the Company and the\nExcluded Stockholders) in the Mergers is fair to such holders.\nThe full text of Barclays\u2019 written opinion is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement. Barclays\u2019 written\nopinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations\nupon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in\nits entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays\u2019 opinion and the methodology that Barclays used to render its\nopinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.\nBarclays\u2019 opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays\u2019 Valuation and Fairness Opinion\nCommittee, is addressed to the Transaction Committee, addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of\nview, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock (other\nthan the executive officers of the Company and the Excluded Stockholders) in the Mergers to such holders\nand does not constitute a recommendation to any Company Stockholder as to how such holder should vote\nwith respect to the Mergers or any other matter. The terms of the Mergers were determined through arm\u2019s-\nlength negotiations between the Company and Parent and were recommended by the Transaction Committee\nand unanimously approved by the Company Board. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of\nconsideration to the Transaction Committee or the Company or that any specific form of consideration\nconstituted the only appropriate consideration for the Mergers. Barclays was not requested to address, and\nits opinion does not in any manner address, the Company\u2019s underlying business decision to proceed with or\neffect the Mergers, the likelihood of the consummation of the Mergers, or the relative merits of the Mergers\nas compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company may engage. In addition,\nBarclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the\namount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the\nMergers, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be received by the Company\nStockholders in the Mergers. No limitations were imposed by the Transaction Committee upon Barclays with\nrespect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things:\nreviewed and analyzed the Merger Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2023, and the specific terms of\nthe Mergers\u037e\nreviewed and analyzed publicly available information concerning the Company that Barclays believed\nto be relevant to its analysis, including the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2021 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31,\n2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022\u037e\nreviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations\nand prospects of the Company furnished to Barclays by the Company, including financial projections\nof the Company prepared by management of the Company\u037e\nreviewed and analyzed a trading history of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock from October 5,\n2020 to February 28, 2023 and a comparison of that trading history with those of other companies that\nBarclays deemed relevant\u037e\n74 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreviewed and analyzed a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition\nof the Company with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant\u037e\nhad discussions with management of the Company concerning its business, operations, assets,\nliabilities, financial condition and prospects\u037e and\nhas undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the\nfinancial and other information used by Barclays without any independent verification of such information\n(and had not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information).\nBarclays also relied upon the assurances of management of the Company that they were not aware of any\nfacts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the\nfinancial projections of the Company, upon the advice of the Company, Barclays assumed that such\nprojections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and\njudgments of management of the Company as to the Company\u2019s future financial performance and that the\nCompany would perform substantially in accordance with such projections. In arriving at its opinion,\nBarclays assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to any such projections or estimates or the\nassumptions on which they were based. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not conduct a physical\ninspection of the properties and facilities of the Company and did not make or obtain any evaluations or\nappraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company. In addition, Barclays was not authorized by the\nTransaction Committee to solicit, and did not solicit, any indications of interest from any third party with\nrespect to the purchase of all or a part of the Company\u2019s business. Barclays\u2019 opinion was necessarily based\nupon market, economic and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its\nopinion. Barclays assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on events or\ncircumstances that may have occurred after the date of its opinion.\nBarclays assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger\nAgreement and all the agreements related thereto. Barclays also assumed, upon the advice of the Company,\nthat all material governmental, regulatory and third-party approvals, consents and releases for the Mergers\nwould be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the Mergers will\nbe consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement without waiver, modification or\namendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof. Barclays did not express any opinion as to\nany tax or other consequences that might result from the Mergers, nor did Barclays\u2019 opinion address any\nlegal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Barclays understood the Company had obtained\nsuch advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other\nanalyses as summarized below. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values\nto the shares of Class A Common Stock but rather made its determination as to fairness, from a financial\npoint of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock\n(other than the executive officers of the Company and the Excluded Stockholders) in the Mergers to such\nholders on the basis of various financial and comparative analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a\ncomplex process and involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of\nfinancial and comparative analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances.\nTherefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor\nconsidered by it but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis\nand factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered by it and in the context of the\ncircumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays believes that its analyses must be\nconsidered as a whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all\nanalyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its\nopinion.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion\nto the Transaction Committee. The summary of Barclays\u2019 analyses and reviews provided below is not a\n75 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncomplete description of the analyses and reviews underlying Barclays\u2019 opinion. The preparation of a fairness\nopinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant\nmethods of analysis and review and the application of those methods to particular circumstances, and,\ntherefore, is not readily susceptible to summary description.\nFor the purposes of its analyses and reviews, Barclays made numerous assumptions with respect to\nindustry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many\nof which are beyond the control of the Company or any other parties to the Mergers. No company, business\nor transaction considered in Barclays\u2019 analyses and reviews is identical to the Company, OpCo, Parent,\nMerger Sub I, Merger Sub II or the Mergers, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews\nis not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and judgments\nconcerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public\ntrading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions considered in Barclays\u2019 analyses and\nreviews. None of the Company, OpCo, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, Barclays or any other person\nassumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates\ncontained in these analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis\nor review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may\nbe significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of\ncompanies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the\ncompanies, businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results\nderived from, Barclays\u2019 analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nThe summary of the financial analyses and reviews summarized below includes information presented in\ntabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses and reviews used by Barclays, the tables\nmust be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete\ndescription of the financial analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without\nconsidering the full description of the analyses and reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions\nunderlying the analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Barclays\u2019 analyses and\nreviews.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nIn order to estimate the present value of the Class A Common Stock, Barclays performed a discounted\ncash flow analysis of the Company. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology\nused to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the \u201cpresent value\u201d of estimated future cash flows of\nthe asset. \u201cPresent value\u201d refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by\ndiscounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic\nassumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate\nfactors.\nTo calculate the estimated enterprise value (\u201cEV\u201d) of the Company using the discounted cash flow\nmethod, Barclays added the Company\u2019s projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years 2023\nthrough 2032 based on the December 31, 2023\u202f-\u202f2032 Management Forecasts to the \u201cterminal value\u201d of the\nCompany as of the end of fiscal year 2032, and discounted such amount to its present value using a mid-year\nconvention and a range of selected discount rates. The after-tax unlevered free cash flows were calculated\nby taking earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and subtracting cash taxes and\ncapital expenditures. The residual value of the Company at the end of the forecast period, or \u201cterminal\nvalue,\u201d was estimated by selecting a range of perpetuity growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%, which were\nderived by Barclays using its professional judgment and experience. The range of after-tax discount rates of\n8.0% to 8.5% was selected based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company and\nthe selected comparable companies. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Class A\nCommon Stock by subtracting actual net debt as of December 31, 2022 from the estimated EV using the\ndiscounted cash flow method and dividing such amount by the fully diluted number of shares of Company\nCapital Stock, as of February 28, 2023, based on information provided by management of the Company\n(excluding the impact of potential dividends elected to be paid in stock to holders of shares of Series A\nFounder Preferred Stock).

The selected comparable companies with respect to the\nCompany were:\nTower Companies\nAmerican Tower Corporation\nCrown Castle Inc.\nSBA Communications Corporation\nTelesites, S.A.B de C.V.\nINWIT S.p.A.\nCellnex Telecom, S.A.\nVantage Towers AG\nData Center Companies\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc.\nEquinix, Inc.\nCyxtera Technologies, Inc.\nTriple-Net Lease Real Estate Interest Trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d)\nRealty Income Corporation\nNational Retail Properties, Inc.\nSpirit Realty Capital, Inc.\nAgree Realty Corporation\nEssential Properties Realty Trust, Inc.\nThe Necessity Retail REIT, Inc.\nFour Corners Property Trust, Inc.\nGetty Realty Corp.\nNETSTREIT Corp.\nGladstone Commercial Corporation\nW.P.

As part of its selected comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated\nand analyzed (a) each tower company\u2019s ratio of EV to (i) its 2022 actual or estimated (\u201c2022A/E\u201d) and 2023\nestimated (\u201c2023E\u201d) tower cash flows (\u201cTCF\u201d) and (ii) its 2022A/E and 2023E earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization and adjusted for non-recurring items (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), (b) each data center\ncompany\u2019s ratio of EV to its 2022A/E and 2023E EBITDA and (c) each triple-net lease REIT\u2019s implied\ncapitalization rate, defined as the ratio of next twelve months\u2019 (\u201cNTM\u201d) net operating income to EV. The EV\nof each company was obtained by adding its short- and long-term debt to the sum of the market value of its\ncommon equity, the value of any preferred stock (at liquidation value) and the book value of any minority\ninterest, finance leases, asset retirement obligations and subtracting its cash and cash equivalents, as\napplicable and based on the relevant financial reporting standards. All of these calculations were performed,\nand based on publicly available financial data (including FactSet, Green Street, SNL and Bloomberg) and\nclosing prices, as of February 28, 2023, the last trading date prior to the delivery of Barclays\u2019 oral opinion.\nThe results of this selected comparable company analysis are summarized below:\nTower Companies\nEV /\u200b\n2022A/E TCF\nEV /\u200b\n2023E TCF\nEV /\u200b\n2022A/E EBITDA\nEV /\u200b\n2023E EBITDA\nMean\n19.2x\n18.2x\n21.0x\n19.1x\nMedian\n18.9x\n18.1x\n22.3x\n19.3x\nData Center Companies\nEV /\u200b\n2022A/E EBITDA\nEV /\u200b\n2023E EBITDA\nMean\n17.5x\n16.1x\nMedian\n19.6x\n18.3x\nTriple-Net Lease REITs\nImplied \nCapitalization\nRate\nInverse Implied \nCapitalization\nRate\nMean\n6.7\n15.6x\nMedian\n6.4\n15.6x\nBarclays selected the comparable companies listed above because of similarities in one or more\nbusiness or operating characteristics with the Company. However, because of the inherent differences\nbetween the business, operations and prospects of the Company and those of the selected comparable\ncompanies, Barclays believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the\nquantitative results of the selected comparable company analysis. Accordingly, Barclays also made\nqualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics\nand prospects of the Company and the selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading\nvalues of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.\nThese qualitative judgments\n78 \n%\n%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrelated primarily to the differing industries, geographies, sizes, growth prospects, profitability levels and\ndegree of operational risk between the Company and the companies included in the selected company\nanalysis. Based upon these judgments, Barclays selected a range of 15.5x to 17.5x multiples of EV to 2023E\nground cash flows (\u201cGCF\u201d) for the Company and applied such range to the December 31, 2023\u202f-\u202f2032\nManagement Forecasts to calculate a range of implied prices per share of Class A Common Stock. The\nfollowing summarizes the result of these calculations:\nLow\nHigh\nImplied equity value per share of Class A Common Stock\n$12.51\n$15.36\nBarclays noted that on the basis of the selected comparable company analysis, the Merger\nConsideration was within the range of implied values per share of Class A Common Stock calculated using\nthe December 31, 2023\u202f-\u202f2032 Management Forecasts.\nOther Factors\nBarclays also reviewed and considered other factors, which were not considered part of its financial\nanalyses in connection with rendering its advice, but were references for informational purposes, including,\namong other things, the illustrative present value of future share price analysis, equity research price targets\nanalysis and historical share price analysis described below.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nBarclays performed an analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share of\nClass A Common Stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of the theoretical\nfuture value of a company\u2019s equity as a function of such company\u2019s financial projections and valuation\nmultiples. Barclays first calculated the implied future EV of the Company for fiscal years ending December 31,\n2023 through December 31, 2030 by applying ratios of multiples of the Company\u2019s EV to NTM GCF ranging\nfrom 15.5x to 17.5x to NTM GCF estimates for the Company as reflected in the December 31, 2023\u202f-\u202f2032\nManagement Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2030. The illustrative EV to NTM GCF\nmultiple estimates were derived by Barclays utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into\naccount the results from the selected comparable companies analysis and the EV to NTM GCF multiples for\nthe Company as of February 28, 2023. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Class A\nCommon Stock based on the fully diluted number of shares of Company Capital Stock as of February 28,\n2023, as provided by management of the Company (including the dilutive effect of potential stock dividends\nto holders of shares of Series A Founder Preferred Stock and corresponding distributions with respect to the\nSeries A Rollover Profits Units).\nUtilizing a range of discount rates of 12.4% to 13.3% based on an analysis of the cost of equity of the\nCompany, Barclays then derived a range of implied present values per share for Class A Common Stock by\ndiscounting to present value the implied future values per share of Class A Common Stock. The following\ntable presents the results of the analysis of the implied present value of the illustrative future value per share\nof Class A Common Stock.\nSelected NTM EV /\nGCF \nMultiple Range\nImplied Equity Value per Share\nof \nClass A Common Stock\nDiscount Rate of 12.4%\u202f-\u202f13.3%\n15.5x\u202f-\u202f17.5x\n$ 8.81\u202f-\u202f$15.09\nThe illustrative present value of future share price analysis for the Company was used for informational\npurposes only and was not included in Barclays\u2019 financial analyses.\nEquity Research Price Targets Analysis\nBarclays reviewed publicly available one-year forward price targets for the Class A Common Stock\nprepared and published by equity research firms that covered the Company as of February 28, 2023. Barclays\nnoted that the range of low to high one-year forward share price targets as of February 28, 2023 was $13.00 to\n$18.00 per share. Barclays also reviewed publicly available one-year forward price targets for the Class A\nCommon Stock prepared and published by equity research firms that covered the Company as of\n79 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFebruary 28, 2023, by deriving in each case, the implied equity value based on the number of shares\noutstanding at the end of the third quarter of 2022 mentioned in the applicable equity research firm report,\nthen adjusted based on the fully diluted number of shares of Company Capital Stock as of February 28, 2023,\nas provided by management of the Company. Barclays noted that the range of low to high one-year forward\nshare price targets as of February 28, 2023, as so adjusted, was $11.46 to $16.94 per share. The price targets\npublished by the equity research firms did not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for shares of\nClass A Common Stock and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial\nperformance of the Company and future market conditions. The equity research price targets analysis for the\nCompany was used for informational purposes only and was not included in Barclays\u2019 financial analyses.\nHistorical Share Price Analysis\nTo illustrate the trend in the historical trading prices of shares of Class A Common Stock, Barclays\nconsidered historical data with regard to the trading prices of Class A Common Stock for the period from\nFebruary 28, 2022 to February 28, 2023. Barclays noted that during the period from February 28, 2022 to\nFebruary 28, 2023, the closing price of the Class A Common Stock ranged from $7.97 to $16.52. The historical\nshare price analysis for the Company was used for informational purposes only and was not included in\nBarclays\u2019 financial analyses.\nGeneral\nBarclays is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking\nactivities, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers\nand acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids,\nsecondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate,\ncorporate and other purposes.

No independent registered\npublic accounting firm provided any assistance in preparing the Management Forecasts. Accordingly, no\nindependent registered public accounting firm has examined, compiled or otherwise performed any\nprocedures with respect to the Management Forecasts or expressed any opinion or given any other form of\nassurance with respect thereto, and they assume no responsibility for the information contained in the\nManagement Forecasts.

There can be no assurance that the projected results\nwill be realized or that actual results will not be materially lower or higher than estimated, whether or not the\nMergers are completed. None of the Company, Parent or their respective affiliates, officers, directors,\nadvisors (including financial advisors) or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results\nwill not differ from the Management Forecasts, and, except as required by applicable law, none of the\nCompany, Parent or their respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or\nreconcile, the Management Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Management\nForecasts were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the\nassumptions underlying the Management Forecasts are shown to be inappropriate.

None of the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors (including\nfinancial advisors) or other representatives assumes any responsibility to holders of shares of Company\nCapital Stock or equity interests in OpCo for the accuracy of this information. In particular, the Management\nForecasts, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily, were based on numerous variables and\nassumptions that are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,\neconomic, competitive and regulatory risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those contained in the Management Forecasts. Because the Management Forecasts cover\nmultiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are\nunlikely to anticipate each circumstance that will have an effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations,\nfinancial condition and cash flows. Important factors that may affect actual results and result in the\nManagement Forecasts not being achieved include, but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements\u201d, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside the control of the Company\nand, upon consummation of\n83 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nthe Mergers, will be beyond the control of EQT or PSP and the Surviving Entities.

The information set forth in the Management\nForecasts is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The\nManagement Forecasts were developed on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Mergers, and\ntherefore the Management Forecasts do not give effect to the Mergers or any changes to the Company\u2019s\noperations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Mergers. Furthermore, the\nManagement Forecasts do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Mergers to be completed and\nshould not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe Management Forecasts contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Company management\nbelieves are helpful in understanding the Company\u2019s past financial performance and future results. Company\nmanagement regularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for\ncomparing the Company\u2019s operating performance on a consistent basis. The non-GAAP financial measures\nare not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While the\nCompany believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding of its\nunderlying operating performance trends compared to historical and prospective periods and its peers and\nthat these measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors regarding\nfinancial and business trends relating to the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows as well as insight into the compliance with its debt covenants, there are limitations associated with the\nuse of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in\naccordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company\u2019s competitors and may not be directly\ncomparable to similarly titled measures of the Company\u2019s competitors due to potential differences in the\nexact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to a\nboard of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed business combination such as the\nMergers if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations\nof non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the Company Board, the Transaction Committee or\ntheir respective financial advisors in connection with their respective evaluations of the Mergers or their\nrespective financial analyses and fairness opinions, as applicable. Accordingly, the Company has not\nprovided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Management Forecasts to the\nrelevant GAAP financial measures.\nThe Management Forecasts summarized in this section were prepared prior to the execution of the\nMerger Agreement and have not been updated to reflect any changes after the date they were prepared. T\nH\nE\nCOMPANY DOES NOT INTEND, AND UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION, TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE\nTHE MANAGEMENT FORECASTS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING SINCE THEIR PREPARATION\nOR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE\nASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE PROJECTIONS ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE. In light of the foregoing\nfactors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Forecasts, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not\nto place undue reliance on the Management Forecasts.",

Mr. Birnbaum is\nparty to an amended and restated individual employment agreement with the Company and OpCo, dated\nApril 17, 2024 (the \u201cBirnbaum Employment Agreement\u201d and, collectively with the Existing Employment\nAgreements, the \u201cExecutive Officer Agreements\u201d). The Existing Employment Agreements provide for\nseverance payments and other benefits in the event of a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d, which includes a\ntermination of employment by the Company in anticipation of a change in control of the Company or a\ntermination by the Company other than for \u201cCause\u201d, death or \u201cDisability\u201d or by the executive for \u201cGood\nReason\u201d  (in each case, as defined in the Existing Employment Agreements) within one year following a\nchange in control of the Company. The Mergers will constitute a change in control of the Company for\npurposes of the Existing Employment Agreements.\nIn the event of a qualifying termination in anticipation of or within one year following a change in\ncontrol of the Company, each executive officer party to an Existing Employment Agreement will be entitled to\nreceive, in addition to certain accrued amounts: (a) a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of two\ntimes the sum of the executive officer\u2019s base salary and annual bonus earned in respect of the fiscal year\nimmediately prior to the termination date\u037e (b) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination based on\ntarget performance\u037e (c) any earned but unpaid bonus for the year prior to the year of termination\u037e (d) a cash\npayment equal to 24 months of COBRA premiums (regardless of whether the executive officer elects COBRA\ncontinuation coverage)\u037e and (e) accelerated vesting of all outstanding Company equity awards. Receipt of\nthe above-described payments and benefits is conditioned upon the executive officer executing (and not\nrevoking) a release of claims in favor of the Company.\nThe Birnbaum Employment Agreement reflects the terms of Mr. Birnbaum\u2019s voluntary resignation as\nSenior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary and transition into the role of special advisor on\nSeptember 1, 2023 (the \u201cTransition Date\u201d), without regard to whether the Merger occurs. If Mr. Birnbaum\ncontinues in employment until the Transition Date, or if Mr. Birnbaum\u2019s employment is terminated by the\nCompany without \u201cCause\u201d or by Mr. Birnbaum for \u201cGood Reason\u201d  (each, as defined in the Birnbaum\nEmployment Agreement) or due to death or disability prior to the Transition Date, he will generally be\nentitled to receive the payments described above in the Existing Employment Agreements (other than, in the\ncase of his continued employment until the Transition Date, accelerated vesting of long-term incentive\ncompensation awarded in 2023), as well as continued payment of base salary and advisor fees (as\napplicable). If Mr. Birnbaum\u2019s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Birnbaum\nfor Good Reason during the two-year period following the Transition date (the \u201cSpecial Advisor Period\u201d), he\nwould generally be entitled to continued advisor fees, benefits continuation through the end of the Special\nAdvisor Period and accelerated vesting of long-term incentive compensation awarded in 2023. None of the\npayments or benefits provided for in the Birnbaum Employment Agreement are in any way conditioned upon\nthe Merger (or any other change in control transaction). Mr. Birnbaum is required to execute a release of\nclaims in favor of the Company on the Transition Date and upon his termination of employment as special\nadvisor.\n86 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Executive Officer Agreements provide that, in the event part or all of the compensation, payments\nor benefits payable in connection with the respective executive officer\u2019s separation with the Company would\nconstitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, then the payments will be\nreduced to the largest amount which would result in no portion of the payments being subject to the excise\ntax if such reduction will provide the executive officer with the best net after-tax result.\nThe severance payments and benefits described above are generally subject to the applicable executive\nofficer\u2019s compliance with restrictive covenants consisting of one-year (two-year, in the case of Messrs.\nBerkman and Birnbaum) post-termination restrictions on competing with the Company and soliciting the\nCompany\u2019s employees or customers, non-disclosure of the Company\u2019s confidential information at any time,\nintellectual property assignment and a mutual non-disparagement.\nTreatment of Annual Bonuses\nThe Merger Agreement provides that each participant, including our executive officers, in a Company\nBenefit Plan (as defined below) that is an annual cash incentive plan will receive a (a) Pre-Closing Bonus (as\ndefined below) based on projected full-year actual performance, pro-rated based on the portion of the plan\nyear elapsed prior to the Closing and (b) Post-Closing Bonus (as defined below) based on full-year target\nperformance, pro-rated based on the remaining duration of the performance period. Payment of the annual\ncash bonus in respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs is generally contingent on the\nemployee\u2019s continued employment through the payment date\u037e provided, however, that in the event of the\nemployee\u2019s termination of employment without Cause (as defined in the Company Stock Plan) between the\nClosing and the end of the performance period, such employee would receive an amount equal to (i) the Pre-\nClosing Bonus and (ii) a portion of the Post-Closing Bonus, pro-rated based on the number of days such\nemployee was employed between the Closing and the end of the performance period.\nRetention and Transaction Bonuses\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may establish a cash-based retention bonus\nprogram and a cash-based transaction bonus program, in both cases for the benefit of certain employees of\nthe Company and its subsidiaries. As of the date of this proxy statement, no director or executive officer has\nbeen allocated awards under these programs.\nArrangements with EQT, PSP and Parent\nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, each of Messrs. Berkman, Bruce, Goldstein\nand Breisinger entered into a new employment agreement with Chord TopCo, LP, to be effective upon the\nCompany Merger Effective Time (the \u201cNew Employment Agreements\u201d). Upon the Company Merger Effective\nTime, Chord TopCo, LP will assign the New Employment Agreements to the Company and such New\nEmployment Agreements will replace and supersede the applicable Existing Employment Agreement for each\nsuch executive officer. The New Employment Agreements have an initial term of five years, subject to earlier\ntermination as provided in the New Employment Agreements, with automatic one-year extensions and\nprovide for (among other things): (a) an annual base salary of $571,000 for Mr. Berkman\u037e $798,000 for each of\nMessrs. Bruce and Goldstein\u037e and $654,000 for Mr. Breisinger\u037e (b) eligibility to receive a cash bonus with a\ntarget of 50% (100%, in the case of Mr. Berkman) of base salary\u037e and (c) eligibility to participate in and\nreceive equity grants or other incentive awards under the equity incentive plan of Chord TopCo, LP or one of\nits affiliates to be established in connection with or following the Closing. In the event of a qualifying\ntermination (which is generally defined to be the same as in the Existing Employment Agreements), each such\nexecutive officer would generally be entitled to the same severance payments and benefits (other than\naccelerated vesting of equity) as described above in the section titled \u201c- Severance Entitlements\u201d, and, other\nthan in connection with a qualifying termination in anticipation of or within one year following a change in\ncontrol, such severance payments and benefits (other than any prior year\u2019s bonus) are subject to cessation\nand recoupment, as applicable, if the executive officer breaches the post-termination restrictions on\ncompeting with the Company, soliciting the Company\u2019s employees or customers, or disclosing the\nCompany\u2019s confidential information, in any case, in a way that would reasonably be expected to result in\nsignificant reputational or monetary harm to the Company.\n87 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIt is possible that other members of management will enter into individual agreements with Parent and/or\none or more of its subsidiaries regarding employment following the Closing\u037e however, no such discussions\nare ongoing as of the time of this proxy statement.\nRollover Agreements\nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Mr. Berkman entered into a Rollover\nAgreement with Parent and Merger Sub II and each of Messrs. Bruce, Goldstein and Breisinger entered into a\nRollover Agreement with Merger Sub II, in each case, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to\nthe terms and conditions set forth therein, such parties agreed to roll over a portion of their existing equity\ninterests in OpCo into equity interests in the Surviving LLC. Please see the section of this proxy statement\ntitled \u201c- Rollover Agreements\u201d.\nManagement Equity Program\nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, EQT and PSP agreed to a term sheet with\ncertain executive officers setting forth the material terms of a management equity program to provide equity\nincentives to certain members of management and other service providers of the Surviving Corporation and\nits subsidiaries following the Closing. The program will consist of an equity pool of approximately 9.5% of\nthe outstanding equity of Chord TopCo, LP (or OpCo) as of the Closing (on a fully diluted basis), from which\ncertain employees, including the executive officers, will be eligible to receive profits interest units, which will\nbe subject to vesting conditions and certain call rights of Chord TopCo, LP (or OpCo). As a condition of any\ngrant of the profits interest units under the management equity program, executive officers who entered into\na New Employment Agreement would be subject to the restrictive covenants therein. As of the date of this\nproxy statement, no director or executive officer has been allocated awards under the management equity\nprogram.\nEQT and PSP further agreed to adopt a cash-based long-term incentive plan to be utilized after the\nClosing for employees (which could, in the discretion of the board of Chord TopCo, LP, include the executive\nofficers), under terms and conditions to be agreed by the board of Chord TopCo, LP and Mr. Berkman. As of\nthe date of this proxy statement, no director or executive officer has been allocated awards under this plan.\nTax Protection Agreement\nOn March 1, 2023, Mr. Berkman, EQT and PSP agreed that, upon the Closing, subject to and in\naccordance with the Merger Agreement, Mr. Berkman will, and Parent will cause the Company TPA Parties to,\nenter into the TPA, pursuant to which the Company TPA Parties will indemnify Mr. Berkman and certain of\nhis affiliated entities for any current taxes resulting from certain non-ordinary course actions that are taken\nby the Company TPA Parties. In the event that the Company TPA Parties take such actions, they will be\nliable for grossed-up tax amounts associated with the income or gain recognized by Mr. Berkman or such of\nhis affiliated entities as a result of such actions. The Company TPA Parties\u2019 liability under the TPA is capped\nat (i) $32 million in the aggregate within the first 20 years of the Closing Date and (ii) $22.5 million in the\naggregate after the twentieth anniversary of the Closing Date\u037e however, in certain limited circumstances, the\ncap will be increased to $40 million. As of the date of this proxy statement, no amounts have been paid to Mr.\nBerkman or any of his affiliated entities under the terms of the TPA.\nSection 280G Mitigation Actions\nEach of our executive officers is subject to a 280G best-net cutback, as described above in the section\ntitled \u201c- Severance Entitlements\u201d. The Company is permitted to take certain actions before the Company\nMerger Effective Time to mitigate the amount of potential \u201cparachute payments\u201d for \u201cdisqualified\nindividuals\u201d  (each, as defined in Section 280G of the Code), including accelerating the vesting or payment of\ncompensation that would have been scheduled to vest or be paid in the future into a year prior to the year in\nwhich the Closing is expected to occur, accelerating the vesting or payment of compensation that would vest\nor become payable on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement or the\nCompany Benefit Plan into a year prior to the year in which the Closing is expected to occur, entering into or\nexpanding non-competition agreements or paying out accrued vacation. As of the date of this proxy\n88 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstatement, the Company has not approved any specific actions to mitigate the expected impact of Section\n280G of the Code on the Company and any disqualified individuals.\nDirector and Officer Indemnification\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, members of the Company Board and executive officers\nof the Company will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and\nofficers\u2019 liability insurance policies following the Closing. For a more detailed description of the provisions\nof the Merger Agreement relating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy\nstatement titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fIndemnification and Insurance\u201d beginning on page 122.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company\u2019s\nnamed executive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are payable in connection with or\notherwise relates to the Mergers. The Company Stockholders are being asked to approve, on a nonbinding,\nadvisory basis, such compensation. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will\nnot be binding on either the Company, the Company Board or Parent. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement\nProposal is approved by the Company Stockholders and the Mergers are consummated, the compensation\nwill be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the\nconditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below and above under the\nsection titled \u201c- Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers\u201d.\nThe potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation\nS-K. The estimated values are based on (a) an assumption that the Mergers are consummated on September\n30, 2023, (b) the per share Merger Consideration of $15.00, (c) the named executive officers\u2019 salary and target\nbonus amounts as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, (d) the number of LTIP Units and shares of\nCompany Restricted Stock held by the named executive officers as of May 9, 2023, the latest practicable date\nto determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, less any awards expected to vest in the\nordinary course prior to September 30, 2023, and assuming no additional grants or forfeitures of Company\nequity awards prior to September 30, 2023 and (e) an assumption that each named executive officer\nexperiences a termination of employment immediately following the consummation of the Mergers under\ncircumstances that entitle such named executive officer to receive severance (i.e., a termination other than\nfor \u201cCause\u201d, death or \u201cDisability\u201d or resignation for \u201cGood Reason\u201d or, for Mr. Birnbaum only, a termination\nother than for \u201cCause\u201d or resignation for \u201cGood Reason\u201d). As such, the amounts indicated below are\nestimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions\ndescribed in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before\nconsummation of the Mergers. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive\nofficer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.\nThe amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of\na 280G best-net cutback, to which all named executive officers are subject\u037e therefore, actual payments to the\nnamed executive officers may be less than the amounts indicated below. In addition, the amounts shown\nbelow do not attempt to reflect any implication from any individual\u2019s Rollover Agreement with Parent and/or\nMerger Sub II or any amounts that Mr. Berkman may be owed under the TPA, nor do such amounts reflect\nthe payments such individuals may receive in respect of the Company Capital Stock, OpCo Class B Common\nUnits or Series B Rollover Profits Units that such individuals may hold.\nPotential Payments to Named Executive Officers\nName\nCash ($)\nEquity ($)\nOther Benefits ($)\nTotal ($)\nWilliam H.

The value of cash severance for\neach named executive officer other than Mr. Birnbaum consists of: (a) two times the sum of the\nexecutive officer\u2019s base salary and annual bonus earned in respect of the fiscal year immediately prior to\nthe termination date, (b) a pro-rata annual bonus for the year of termination based on target\nperformance, assuming a termination date of September 30, 2023 and (c) a cash payment equal to 24\nmonths of COBRA premiums (regardless of whether the executive officer elects COBRA continuation\ncoverage). The value of cash severance for Mr. Birnbaum includes continued payment of his special\nadvisor fees through the end of the Special Advisor Period. As of the date of this proxy statement, all\nbonuses for the year prior to the assumed year of termination have been paid and are not included. Each\nnamed executive officer\u2019s cash severance payments are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d, as such payments will not be\npayable solely as a result of the occurrence of the Company Merger Effective Time and will only be\npayable in the event of a qualifying termination, or, in the case of Mr. Birnbaum, upon a termination\nwithout Cause or for Good Reason, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions described in the\nsection titled \u201c- Severance Entitlements\u201d.

As described in such section\nat the OpCo Merger Effective Time or Company Merger Effective Time, as applicable, except as\notherwise agreed by Parent and the applicable award holder, including pursuant to any Rollover\nAgreement, (i) each LTIP Unit (whether vested or unvested) will vest with all applicable performance\nconditions deemed satisfied and be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment, without\ninterest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Class A Common\nStock into which such LTIP Unit is convertible immediately prior to the OpCo Merger Effective Time and\n(ii) each share of Company Restricted Stock held by an employee of the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective\nTime will be canceled and converted into an RS Payment Right\u037e provided that, if the employment of a\nholder of an RS Payment Right is terminated following the Company Merger Effective Time but prior to\nthe applicable vesting date by Parent without Cause (as defined in the Company Stock Plan) or due to\ndeath or Disability (as defined in the Company Stock Plan), then the vesting and payment of such RS\nPayment Right will be accelerated to the first payroll date after the date of such termination.

On\nApril 14, 2023, the Company responded to this demand letter by denying the allegations contained therein\nand objecting to such purported stockholder's scope of requests but indicating a proper inspection of books\nand records would be permitted, subject to negotiation of an appropriate scope of production and execution\nof a standard confidentiality agreement.\nBetween April 7, 2023 and May 1, 2023, three complaints were filed in connection with the Mergers.

The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants caused to be filed\nwith the SEC a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement relating to the Mergers in\nviolation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder.

The \u201cfair value\u201d of your\nshares of Company Capital Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less\nthan, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger\nAgreement. These rights are known as \u201cappraisal rights\u201d. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such\nappraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.\nPersons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL will not receive the Merger\nConsideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an\namount determined to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Company Capital Stock following petition to, and an\nappraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair\nvalue of their shares of Company Capital Stock determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the\nsame as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to comply\nstrictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of\nappraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, persons\nwishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to\nexercise such rights.\nA copy of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following\npublicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following\nsummary is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to Section 262 of the DGCL and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement.\nAny person who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the\nDGCL and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such\nrights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a\nrecommendation that persons seek to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Failure to\ncomply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of a\nperson\u2019s appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled\nto receive the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.\nA holder of record or beneficial owner of shares of Company Capital Stock who (a) continuously holds\nsuch shares through the Company Merger Effective Time, (b) has not consented to or otherwise voted in\nfavor of the Mergers or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (c) strictly complies with the\nprocedures under Section 262 of the DGCL, (d) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for\nappraisal of such shares and (e) in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (i) reasonably identifies in\nhis, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (ii) provides\ndocumentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement that such\ndocumentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (iii) provides an address at\nwhich such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the\nChancery List (as defined below), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of Company\nCapital Stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nMergers, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon\nthe amount determined to be the fair value.\nSection 262 of the DGCL requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a\nmeeting of stockholders, the stockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be available not less than\ntwenty (20) days before the meeting to vote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of Section\n262 of the DGCL or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which\nSection 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes the\nCompany\u2019s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Mergers, in\ncompliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL.\n94 \nAttention: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Company Capital Stock, you must satisfy each of the\nfollowing conditions: you must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of\nCompany Capital Stock before the taking of the vote on the Mergers, which demand must reasonably inform\nus of the identity of the holder of record of shares of Company Capital Stock for which appraisal is\ndemanded and, for beneficial owners only, such demand must be accompanied by documentary evidence of\nsuch beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and\ncorrect copy of what it purports to be and must provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents\nto receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List\u037e you must not vote or\nsubmit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e you must hold your shares of\nCompany Capital Stock continuously through the Company Merger Effective Time\u037e and you must comply\nwith the other applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL.\nA Company Stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail his, her or its written demand\nfor appraisal to the following address:\nRadius Global Infrastructure, Inc. \n3 Bala Plaza East, Suite 502 \nBala Cynwyd, PA 19004 \nAttention: Jay L.

There is no present intent on the part of the Company or the\nSurviving Corporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should\nassume that the Company and the Surviving Corporation will not file such a petition or initiate any\nnegotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of Company Capital Stock. Accordingly, persons who\ndesire to have their shares of Company Capital Stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for\nthe perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of\nthe DGCL. If, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Company Merger Effective Time, no\n95 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npetition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously\ndemanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Company Merger Effective Time, any person\nwho has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled,\nupon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate\nnumber of shares of Company Capital Stock not voted in favor of the Mergers and with respect to which\ndemands for appraisal were received by the Surviving Corporation and the aggregate number of holders of\nsuch shares. Such statement must be given within ten (10) days after the written request therefor has been\nreceived by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for the\ndelivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.\nUpon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the\nSurviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such\nservice, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list\ncontaining the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of Company\nCapital Stock and with whom the Surviving Corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such\nshares (the \u201cChancery List\u201d). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nshall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to\nthe Surviving Corporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery List.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will determine which persons have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and have\nbecome entitled to appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the\npersons who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of Company Capital Stock and who hold shares\nrepresented by certificates to submit their certificates of shares of Company Capital Stock to the Register in\nChancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any person fails to\ncomply with such direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.\nIf immediately before the Company Merger Effective Time, the shares of the class or series of Company\nCapital Stock as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all holders of such shares of\nCompany Capital Stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares\nentitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (2)\nthe value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal\nproceedings, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior\nto the final determination of the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the\nChancery List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not\nentitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with\nthe rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal\nproceedings. Through such proceedings the Delaware Court of Chancery shall determine the fair value of\nshares of Company Capital Stock taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Mergers, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon\nthe amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion,\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound\nquarterly from the Company Merger Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%)\nover the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the\nperiod between the Company Merger Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time\nbefore the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each person entitled\nto appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only on the sum of (1)\nthe difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of Company Capital Stock\nas determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid by the\nSurviving Corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.\n96 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhen the fair value of the shares of Company Capital Stock is determined, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to\nreceive the same.\nAlthough the Company believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to\nthe outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and persons\nshould recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the\nsame as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, the Surviving Corporation does not anticipate offering more\nthan the Merger Consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in\nany appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of the relevant\nshares of Company Capital Stock is less than the Merger Consideration.\nIn determining \u201cfair value\u201d, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant\nfactors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be\nconsidered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise\nadmissible in court\u201d should be considered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all\nrelevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making\nthis determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings\nprospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of\nthe date of the Mergers which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of\nthe DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Mergers.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme\nCourt stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of\nvalue\u201d, but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment\nor expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that\n\u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as\nof the date of the Mergers and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d In addition, the Delaware\ncourts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may\nnot be a dissenting person\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nThe cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed\nupon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs\ndo not include attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys\u2019\nand expert witness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List\nwho participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Company Capital\nStock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award\npursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nAny person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not be\nentitled to vote for any purpose any shares of Company Capital Stock subject to such demand or to receive\npayment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to\nthe holder of record at a date prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.\nNo appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any person without\nthe approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any\napplication to the Delaware Court of Chancery made under Section 262(j) of the DGCL\u037e provided, however,\nthat this provision shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding\nor joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept\nthe terms offered upon the Mergers within sixty (60) days after the Company Merger Effective Time. If no\npetition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery within one hundred twenty (120) days\nafter the Company Merger Effective Time, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously\ndemanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.\n97",

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers\nThe following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of\nCompany Common Stock with respect to the disposition of Company Common Stock in exchange for cash\npursuant to the Company Merger. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete analysis or\ndescription of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Company Merger and does not\naddress consequences to holders of Founder Preferred Stock, Company equity awards or interests in OpCo\n(including Rollover Equity). This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, all of which are\nsubject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could affect\nthe accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein. The Internal Revenue Service may not agree\nwith the tax consequences described in this discussion.\nThis discussion assumes that holders of Company Common Stock hold their shares as capital assets\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion\ndoes not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of Company\nCommon Stock in light of such holder\u2019s particular circumstances, nor does it discuss the special\nconsiderations applicable to holders of Company Common Stock subject to special treatment under the U.S.\nfederal income tax laws, such as, for example, financial institutions or broker-dealers, mutual funds,\npartnerships or other pass-through entities and their partners or members, regulated investment companies,\nreal estate investment trusts, tax-exempt organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance\ncompanies, dealers in securities or non-U.S. currencies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market\nmethod of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, U.S.\nexpatriates, holders who acquired their shares of Company Common Stock through the exercise of stock\noptions or otherwise as compensation, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, holders who exercise\ntheir appraisal rights in connection with the Company Merger, holders who hold their shares of Company\nCommon Stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as\ndefined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, accrual method holders who prepare an\n\u201capplicable financial statement\u201d  (as defined in Section 451 of the Code) and holders who own or have owned\n(directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Company Common Stock (by vote or value)\noutstanding. In addition, this discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the laws of\nany state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction or U.S. federal non-income tax consequences (e.g., the U.S. federal\nestate or gift tax or the application of the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the\nCode).\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Company\nCommon Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the\npartner and activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding Company Common\nStock, you should consult your own tax advisor.\nAll holders should consult their own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including\nthe application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange\nfor shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Company Common\nStock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\nan individual citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\na corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)\ncreated or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of\nColumbia\u037e\na trust if (1) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States\nand one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have\n98 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in effect\nunder applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes\u037e or\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nA \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or an entity or arrangement treated\nas a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of Company Common Stock that is not a U.S. holder.\nTax Consequences of the Company Merger for Holders of Company Common Stock\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the Company Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nequal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the Company Merger and\nsuch U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company Common Stock converted into cash pursuant\nto the Company Merger. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital\ngain or loss if the holder\u2019s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the Company\nMerger. Long-term capital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally\neligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal income taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to\nlimitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or at different prices,\nsuch U.S. holder must determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to\neach block of common stock.\nA U.S. holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup\nwithholding (at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received pursuant to the Company Merger, unless\nsuch holder properly establishes an exemption or provides its correct tax identification number and otherwise\ncomplies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules can be refunded or credited\nagainst a U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any\u037e provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the\nrequired information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nAny gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the Company Merger by a non-U.S. holder\ngenerally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\nthe gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if\nrequired by an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the\ncase of an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which\ncase the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S.\nholder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. corporation, such corporation may be subject to\nbranch profits tax at the rate of 30% on the effectively connected gain (or such lower rate as may be\nspecified by an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\nthe non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days\nor more in the taxable year of the Company Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case\nthe non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax at a 30% rate (or a lower applicable income tax\ntreaty rate) on any gain derived from the disposition of Company Common Stock pursuant to the\nCompany Merger (other than gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business), which may be\noffset by U.S. source capital losses\u037e or\nshares of Company Common Stock constitute a United States real property interest because the\nCompany is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d) for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Company\nMerger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held shares of Company Common Stock (the \u201crelevant\nperiod\u201d).\n99 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nThe Company believes that it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC during the relevant period.\nEven if the Company is or was a USRPHC during the relevant period, gain arising from a non-U.S. holder\u2019s\nreceipt of cash in exchange for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger will not be subject\nto U.S. federal income tax if the Company Common Stock is \u201cregularly traded\u201d, as defined in applicable U.S.\nTreasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such non-U.S. holder owned, actually and\nconstructively, 5% or less of the Company Common Stock throughout the relevant period.\nA non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup\nwithholding will apply with respect to the cash received by such holder pursuant to the Company Merger,\nunless such non-U.S. holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor\ndoes not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person as defined\nunder the Code) or such holder otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be\nrefunded or credited against a non-U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any\u037e provided that such\nnon-U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.

The terms and conditions of the Mergers are more fully set forth in the Merger\nAgreement.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft, dated March 1, 2023, of the Merger Agreement and held\ndiscussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of Radius\nconcerning the business, operations and prospects of Radius. We examined certain publicly available\nbusiness and financial information relating to Radius as well as certain financial forecasts and other\ninformation and data relating to Radius which were provided to or discussed with us by the management of\nRadius. We reviewed the financial terms of the Mergers as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to,\namong other things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes of Radius Class A Common\nStock\u037e the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of Radius\u037e and the capitalization and\nfinancial condition of Radius. In connection with our engagement and at the direction of Radius, we were\nrequested to approach, and we held discussions with, third parties to solicit indications of interest in the\npossible acquisition of Radius. In addition to the foregoing, we conducted such other analyses and\nexaminations and considered such other information and financial, economic and market criteria as we\ndeemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion.

Cynwyd, PA 19004\nMembers of the Board of Directors:\nYou have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of\nshares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cRadius Class A Common Stock\u201d), of\nRadius Global Infrastructure, Inc. (\u201cRadius\u201d) of the Merger Consideration (defined below) to be received by\nsuch holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an Agreement and Plan of\nMerger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) proposed to be entered into among Radius, APW OpCo LLC (\u201cOpCo\u201d),\nChord Parent, Inc. (\u201cParent\u201d), Chord Merger Sub I, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\nI\u201d) and Chord Merger Sub II, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub I (\u201cMerger Sub II\u201d). As more\nfully described in the Merger Agreement, (a) (i) Merger Sub I will be merged with and into Radius and (ii)\nMerger Sub II will be merged with and into OpCo (the \u201cMergers\u201d) and (b) each outstanding share of the\nRadius Class A Common Stock, other than (i) Appraisal Shares and (ii) Owned Company Common Stock\n(each as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $15.00, in cash (the\n\u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). The terms and conditions of the Mergers are more fully set forth in the Merger\nAgreement.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft, dated March 1, 2023, of the Merger Agreement and held\ndiscussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of Radius\nconcerning the business, operations and prospects of Radius. We examined certain publicly available\nbusiness and financial information relating to Radius as well as certain financial forecasts and other\ninformation and data relating to Radius which were provided to or discussed with us by the management of\nRadius. We reviewed the financial terms of the Mergers as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to,\namong other things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes of Radius Class A Common\nStock\u037e the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of Radius\u037e and the capitalization and\nfinancial condition of Radius. In connection with our engagement and at the direction of Radius, we were\nrequested to approach, and we held discussions with, third parties to solicit indications of interest in the\npossible acquisition of Radius. In addition to the foregoing, we conducted such other analyses and\nexaminations and considered such other information and financial, economic and market criteria as we\ndeemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion. The issuance of our opinion has been authorized by our\nfairness opinion committee.\nIn rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the\naccuracy and completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to\nor otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and upon the assurances of the management of Radius that\nthey are not aware of any relevant information that has been omitted or that remains undisclosed to us. With\nrespect to financial forecasts and other information and data relating to Radius provided to or otherwise\nreviewed by or discussed with us, we have been advised by the management of Radius, and we have\nassumed, with your consent, that such financial forecasts and other information and data were reasonably\nprepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the\nmanagement of Radius as to, and are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate, the future financial\nperformance of Radius and the other matters covered thereby. We express no view or opinion as to any\nfinancial forecasts and other information or data (or underlying assumptions on which any such financial\nforecasts and other information or data are based) provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with\nus.\nB-1",
