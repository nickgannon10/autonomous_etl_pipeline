(\u201cEvercore\u201d) to provide financial advisory services in connection\nwith a possible transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne. As part of this engagement, Aerojet Rocketdyne\nrequested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be\nreceived by the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. On December 19, 2020, at a meeting of the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors held to evaluate the proposed Merger, Evercore rendered to the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of that date and\nbased upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore\u2019s\nopinion, the merger consideration of $56.00 per share minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-\nClosing Dividend (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Pre-Closing Cash\nDividend\u201d) to be received by holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock in the Merger was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated December 19, 2020, which sets forth, among other things, the\nprocedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of\nreview undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated\nherein by reference. Aerojet Rocketdyne encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety.\nEvercore\u2019s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board\nof directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not\nconstitute a recommendation to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the\nMerger, including as to how any holder of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock should vote or act in respect\nof the Merger. Evercore\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business\nor financial strategies that might be available to Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor does it address the underlying business\ndecision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to engage in the Merger.\nFor more information, see the section in this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Opinion of Evercore Group\nL.L.C.\u201d\nInterests of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 79)",

Since the determination of the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend that is treated as a taxable dividend will not\nbe completed until after the closing of the Merger, it is possible that a broker, dealer, bank or other custodian that\nholds Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock beneficially owned by a Non-U.S. Holder may withhold at a rate of 30% (or\na lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend.\nStockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the\nMerger and to the Pre-Closing Dividend in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising\nunder U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction and any applicable\nincome tax treaty.",

Questions may be submitted during the special meeting through\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2021SM. Questions and answers will be grouped by topic and\nsubstantially similar questions will be grouped and answered once.\u201d\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLDING SHARES AS A STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD AND AS A\nBENEFICIAL OWNER?\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s transfer agent, Computershare, Inc.,\nyou are considered a \u201cstockholder of record\u201d or a \u201cregistered stockholder\u201d of those shares. In this case, your proxy\nmaterials have been sent to you directly by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. If your shares are held in a stock\nbrokerage account or by a bank, trust or other nominee or custodian, including shares you may own as a participant\nin the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of those shares,\nwhich are held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d The proxy materials have been forwarded to you by or on behalf of your broker,\nbank, trustee or other holder who is considered the stockholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner,\nyou have the right to direct your broker, bank, trustee or other holder of record as to how to vote your shares by\nfollowing their instructions for voting.\nWHAT ARE BROKER NON-VOTES AND HOW ARE THEY COUNTED?\nBroker non-votes occur when nominees, such as brokers and banks holding shares on behalf of the beneficial\nowners, are prohibited from exercising discretionary voting authority for beneficial owners who have not provided\nvoting instructions at least ten days before the Special Meeting. If no instructions are given within that time frame,\nthe nominees may not vote those shares on matters deemed \u201cnon-routine\u201d by the NYSE. The proposals for\nstockholder consideration herein are non-routine matters and nominees cannot vote without instructions from the\nbeneficial owner. These so-called \u201cbroker non-votes,\u201d if any, will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal 1\nand no effect on the outcome of Proposal 2 and Proposal 3. Broker non-votes are not counted for the purposes of\ndetermining the number of shares present in person or represented by proxy on a voting matter. For these reasons,\nplease promptly vote by telephone, or Internet, or mail.\nMAY I CHANGE MY VOTE?\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting\nby:\n\u2022\nReturning a signed proxy card bearing a later date\u037e\n\u2022\nSending written notice of revocation to the Company, c/o the Secretary\u037e\n\u2022\nSubmitting a new, proper proxy by telephone, Internet or paper ballot, after the date of the earlier voted\nproxy\u037e or\n\u2022\nAttending the Special Meeting via the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2021SM and\nvoting using the control number we have provided to you.\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker, bank or\nother nominee. You may also vote at the Special Meeting via the Internet at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2021SM if you obtain a legal proxy as described above.\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 1)?\nUnder applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding\nshares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to\ngive voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against\nthe proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nWHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 2)?\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, present or represented by\nproxy at the Special Meeting, is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.\nThe Special Meeting may also be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting for a proper purpose or by the\nstockholders for any other purpose per Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s bylaws.\nWHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER-RELATED NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nCOMPENSATION PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 3)?\nAssuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock,\npresent or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter, is required to\napprove the Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation Proposal (Proposal 3). The stockholders\u2019 vote\nregarding Proposal 3 is a non-binding, advisory vote. Since compensation and benefits that may be paid or provided\nin connection with the Merger are based on contractual arrangements with the named executive officers, the outcome\nof this advisory vote will not affect the obligation to make these payments and these payments may still be made\neven if the stockholders do not approve the Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation Proposal.\nWHAT CONSTITUTES A QUORUM?\nAs of the Record Date, 77,503,616 shares of common stock were outstanding. A majority of the outstanding shares\nentitled to vote at the Special Meeting, represented individually or by proxy, will constitute a quorum. Shares\nrepresented by a proxy that directs that the shares abstain from voting or that a vote be withheld on a matter will be\nincluded at the Special Meeting for quorum purposes. Shares represented by proxy as to which no voting\ninstructions are given as to matters to be voted upon will be included at the Special Meeting for quorum purposes.\nWHAT IS THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNET ADDRESS?\nThe Company\u2019s Internet address is www.AerojetRocketdyne.com. You can access this proxy statement at this\nInternet address, as well as all other Company filings with the SEC.\nThe Company will provide free of charge a print copy of the proxy materials to any beneficial owner of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock as of the Record Date who sends a written request to:\nAerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.\nAttn: Corporate Secretary\n222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500\nEl Segundo, California 90245\nWILL ANY OTHER MATTERS BE VOTED ON?\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, our management knows of no other matter that will be presented for\nconsideration at the Special Meeting other than those matters discussed in this proxy statement. If any other matters\nproperly come before the Special Meeting and call for a vote of the stockholders, validly executed proxies will be\nvoted in accordance with the recommendation of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s board of directors.\nWHO IS SOLICITING PROXIES UNDER THIS PROXY STATEMENT?\nThe proxies being solicited hereby are being solicited by our board of directors. The cost of soliciting proxies in the\nenclosed form will be borne by the Company. Officers and regular employees of the Company may, but without\nreceiving additional compensation other than their regular compensation, solicit proxies by further\n20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmailings, personal conversations, by telephone, facsimile, or electronic means. The Company will, upon request,\nreimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial\nowners of the stock. The Company has retained Okapi Partners, an independent proxy solicitation firm, to assist in\nsoliciting proxies on its behalf. The Company has agreed to pay Okapi Partners a fee of approximately $45,000, plus\ncosts and expenses, for these services. If stockholders need assistance with casting or changing their vote, they\nshould contact our proxy solicitor, Okapi Partners, toll-free at 1-888-785-6707.",

            "text": "MERGER RELATED Q & A\nWHAT IS THE MERGER?\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Lockheed Martin in an all-cash\ntransaction, which we refer to as the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d throughout this proxy statement. The acquisition will be\nimplemented by the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin with and into Aerojet Rocketdyne, with\nAerojet Rocketdyne surviving that merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin.\nWHAT WILL HOLDERS OF AEROJET ROCKETDYNE COMMON STOCK RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?\nIf the Merger is completed, holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive $56.00 per share in cash, without\ninterest and less, to the extent paid or payable as discussed further in this proxy statement, the $5.00 per share\namount of the Pre-Closing Dividend, unless the holder properly exercises their appraisal rights. This $56.00 per share\namount represents a premium of approximately 33% to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s closing stock price on December 18,\n2020 (the last trading day before the announcement of the Merger Agreement), and a premium of approximately 42%\nto Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s volume weighted average stock price in the 90 trading days prior to announcement of the\nMerger Agreement.\nWHAT WILL HOLDERS OF AEROJET ROCKETDYNE OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS,\nRESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?\nAt the effective time of the Merger, and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement:\n\u2022\nOutstanding unvested shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s restricted common stock will automatically become\nfully vested (for shares subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed achievement of maximum\nperformance) and cashed out as specified in the Merger Agreement promptly following the effective time of\nthe Merger.\n\u2022\nEach outstanding option and SAR with respect to shares of our common stock that have an exercise price\nor grant price, as applicable, that is less than the Price Per Share will be automatically canceled and cashed\nout.\n\u2022\nEach outstanding option and SAR with exercise or grant prices equal to or greater than the Price Per Share\nwill be canceled for no consideration.\n\u2022\nEach outstanding restricted stock unit (for units subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed\nachievement of maximum performance), to the extent granted prior to the execution of the Merger\nAgreement, will be automatically canceled and, upon delivery of a notice and acknowledgment, cashed out\nas specified in the Merger Agreement within ten business days following the effective time of the Merger\nor at such other time or times to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of additional income taxes\nunder Section 409A of the Code.\n\u2022\nEach outstanding restricted stock unit with respect to shares of our common stock that was granted on or\nafter the execution of the Merger Agreement will be automatically canceled. With respect to each cancelled\nrestricted stock unit, (i) for individuals who remain employed by Lockheed Martin or its affiliates through\nthe applicable grant date of such replacement award, Lockheed Martin will grant a replacement award of\nLockheed Martin restricted stock units based on the total number of shares of our common stock subject to\nsuch cancelled restricted stock units (for units subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed\nachievement of maximum performance) multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (as defined in the\nMerger Agreement) or (ii) for individuals who do not remain\n21TABLE OF CONTENTS\nemployed by Lockheed Martin or its affiliates through the applicable grant date of the replacement awards\nreferenced in the immediately preceding clause (i), Lockheed Martin will pay an amount in cash as specified\nin the Merger Agreement within ten business days following such holder\u2019s termination of employment.\nWHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?\nWe are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in\nthe second half of 2021. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the\nMerger is subject to the closing conditions described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement - Conditions to the Merger,\u201d many of which are outside of our control.\nIF THE MERGER IS COMPLETED, HOW WILL I RECEIVE THE CASH FOR MY SHARES?\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, promptly after the effective time of the Merger, a designated paying agent will\nsend each holder of record of a certificate representing shares of common stock or of uncertificated shares of\ncommon stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger a customary letter of transmittal and instructions\nadvising such holder as to how to surrender or transfer such shares of common stock in exchange for the Merger\nConsideration. The paying agent will promptly pay such holders the Merger Consideration upon (i) the surrender of a\ncertificate representing shares of common stock to the paying agent (or compliance with the reasonable procedures\nestablished by the paying agent for transfer of uncertificated shares) and (ii) delivery of a properly completed letter of\ntransmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the paying agent or Lockheed Martin. Interest will not\nbe paid or accrue in respect of cash payments. The amount of any cash payments paid to you will be reduced by any\napplicable withholding taxes.\nYou should not surrender your shares of common stock without a letter of transmittal.\nSee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Payment for the Shares.\u201d\nAM I ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER DELAWARE LAW?\nIf the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of Proposal 1 (adoption of the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions contemplated thereby) and who properly demand appraisal of their shares will be entitled to\nappraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the\n\u201cDGCL\u201d). This means that holders of shares of common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of common stock,\nexclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with\ninterest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. Stockholders who\nwish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to\nthe exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising\nappraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL\nregarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex D to this proxy statement.\nWILL I BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX UPON THE EXCHANGE OF COMMON STOCK FOR\nCASH PURSUANT TO THE MERGER?\nIf you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Material U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend\u201d), the exchange of common stock for\ncash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will\nrequire a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the Merger.\nA Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Material U.S. federal\nIncome Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend\u201d) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has\ncertain connections to the United States.\n22\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPlease see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend.\u201d We recommend that you consult your own tax advisor\nregarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you in light of your own particular\ncircumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or\nforeign taxing jurisdiction and any applicable income tax treaty.\nDO ANY OF AEROJET ROCKETDYNE\u2019S DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER\nTHAT MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS GENERALLY?\nIn considering the recommendation of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s board of directors with respect to the proposal to adopt\nProposal 1 (adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby), you should be aware\nthat our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the\ninterests of stockholders generally, including golden parachute payment mitigation actions, payments upon\ntermination following a change-in-control, cashing out of equity-based awards held by our directors and executive\nofficers and continued indemnification and insurance coverage for our directors and executive officers. In (i)\nevaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger\u037e and (iii)\nrecommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s board of directors was\naware of and considered these interests, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger.\u201d\nWHO CAN HELP ANSWER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS?\nIf you have any questions concerning the Merger, the Special Meeting or this proxy statement, would like additional\ncopies of this proxy statement or need help voting your shares of our common stock, please contact our proxy\nsolicitor:\nOkapi Partners\n1212 Avenue of the Americas, 24th Floor\nNew York, NY 10036\ntoll-free at 1-888-785-6707\ninfo@okapipartners.com\nDIVIDEND RELATED Q & A",

            "text": "DIVIDEND RELATED Q & A\nIS PAYMENT OF THE PRE-CLOSING DIVIDEND CONTINGENT ON APPROVAL OF THE MERGER?\nNo. On December 19, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s board of directors declared a one-time cash dividend of $5.00 per\nshare payable on March 24, 2021 to stockholders of record of common stock as of the close of business on March 10,\n2021. Payment of this Pre-Closing Dividend is not conditioned on approval of the Merger.\nDOES THE PRE-CLOSING DIVIDEND IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION I WILL RECEIVE IN THE\nMERGER?\nYes. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, the $56.00 per share price will be reduced\nby the $5.00 per share Pre-Closing Dividend to the extent it is paid prior to closing or payable after closing. As a\nresult:\n\u2022\nIf the Merger closes before the close of business on March 10, 2021, which we do not expect to be the case,\nno dividend will be paid to stockholders and stockholders will receive $56.00 in cash per share of common\nstock at the closing. In this situation, no dividend will be paid to stockholders because all shares of our\ncommon stock will have been canceled prior to the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date.\n\u2022\nIf the Merger closes after the close of business on March 10, 2021, but before payment of the Pre-Closing\nDividend on March 24, 2021, which we do not expect to be the case, stockholders will receive $51.00 in cash\nper share of common stock in consideration at closing. In this situation, the Merger Agreement provides\nthat, on March 24, the Surviving Corporation will pay the $5.00 per share dividend to stockholders of\nrecord as of the close of business on March 10, 2021.\n23TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nIf the Merger closes after the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend on March 24, 2021, as we expect will be\nthe case, stockholders will receive $51.00 in cash per share of common stock in consideration at closing. In\nthis situation, stockholders of record as of the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date will have already received\nthe $5.00 per share dividend by the effective time of the Merger.\nWILL I BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON THE PRE-CLOSING DIVIDEND?\nAlthough the tax treatment of the Pre-Closing Dividend is not entirely clear, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed\nMartin intend to report the Pre-Closing Dividend as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that this characterization applies, the amount of this distribution\nwould be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of a U.S. Holder\u2019s (as defined in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing\nDividend\u201d) pro rata share of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes), then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder\u2019s basis in its\nAerojet Rocketdyne common stock, and finally as capital gain from the sale or exchange of Aerojet Rocketdyne\ncommon stock.\nAssuming the Pre-Closing Dividend is treated as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common shares\nfor United States federal income tax purposes, a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend\u201d)\ngenerally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable\nincome tax treaty) with respect to the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend treated as a taxable dividend unless certain\nexceptions apply. Since the determination of the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend that is treated as a taxable\ndividend will not be completed until after the closing of the Merger, it is possible that a broker, dealer, bank or other\ncustodian that holds Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock beneficially owned by a Non-U.S. Holder may withhold at a\nrate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend.\nPlease see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend.\u201d We recommend that you consult your own tax advisor\nregarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Pre-Closing Dividend to you in light of your own particular\ncircumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or\nforeign taxing jurisdiction and any applicable income tax treaty.\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE SPECIAL MEETING",

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, with the assistance of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management, regularly\nevaluates Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s prospects and strategy in light of its performance, the business and economic\nenvironment, as well as developments in the aerospace and defense industries, and opportunities and challenges\nfacing Aerojet Rocketdyne and other participants in such industries, all with a view toward maximizing stockholder\nvalue. These reviews have included, among other things, consideration of potential strategic alternatives, including\nthe possibility of strategic acquisitions, divestitures and business combination transactions, as well as other uses of\ncompany resources, including potential recapitalization transactions and other capital deployment transactions.\nAerojet Rocketdyne has for many years served as a supplier to United Launch Alliance (\u201cULA\u201d), a joint venture\nbetween Lockheed Martin and The Boeing Company (\u201cBoeing\u201d). ULA currently provides launch services using the\nAtlas and Delta launch vehicles, which both use Aerojet Rocketdyne-made rocket engines. In light of the nature of\nthe businesses of Aerojet Rocketdyne and each of Lockheed Martin, Boeing and ULA and the commercial\nrelationship between Aerojet Rocketdyne and each of those companies, members of Aerojet Rocketdyne\nmanagement are generally familiar with those other companies\u2019 businesses, and representatives of Aerojet\nRocketdyne have periodically discussed Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s commercial relationships with ULA with\nrepresentatives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\nOn January 28, 2020, Gregory A. Jones, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business Development of Aerojet\nRocketdyne, contacted representatives of Boeing regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s potential interest in a strategic\nbusiness combination involving Boeing\u2019s Space and Launch division and/or Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s acquisition of\nBoeing\u2019s interest in ULA. During February and March 2020, Mr. Jones had additional discussions with\nrepresentatives of Boeing concerning Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s potential interest in any such potential transaction.\nOn March 18, 2020, Mr. Jones contacted Mr. Robert E. Mullins, Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy and\nBusiness Development of Lockheed Martin, and Mr. Jones indicated that Aerojet Rocketdyne might have potential\ninterest in acquiring ULA. During this call, the discussion expanded into a broader discussion about the strategic\nrelationship between Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin and the possibility of a potential business\ncombination involving the two companies. Later that day, Mr. Jones informed Warren G. Lichtenstein, Executive\nChairman of Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Eileen P. Drake, Chief Executive Officer and President of Aerojet Rocketdyne,\nabout this discussion with Lockheed Martin.\nDuring April 2020, Mr. Jones had several discussions with Mr. Mullins and Mr. Gregory L. Psihas, Vice President,\nCorporate Development of Lockheed Martin, regarding the possibility of a potential business combination involving\nAerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin.\nIn April 2020, members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management began to have discussions with representatives of Citi\nregarding Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s potential retention of Citi as a financial advisor to Aerojet Rocketdyne and the\nAerojet Rocketdyne board of directors to assist in analyzing an array of potential business and financial\n35TABLE OF CONTENTS\nmatters, including a possible strategic transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne and other strategic alternatives.\nThereafter members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management and representatives of Citi engaged in a number of\ndiscussions regarding various business and financial matters.\nOn April 14, 2020, Boeing informed Aerojet Rocketdyne that no decision had been made or was expected to be made\nin the foreseeable future to either divest their 50% equity ownership interest in ULA or pursue a possible strategic\ncombination involving Aerojet Rocketdyne, given Boeing senior leadership\u2019s increasing attention being devoted\ntowards the impact of COVID-19.\nOn May 4, 2020, Mr. Jones and Mr. Psihas had a telephone call during which Mr. Psihas confirmed Lockheed Martin\u2019s\ninterest in continuing preliminary discussions with Aerojet Rocketdyne concerning a potential business combination\ntransaction and the timing for potential next steps in the process, including the execution of an appropriate\nconfidentiality agreement between Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin and a potential management\npresentation by Aerojet Rocketdyne with respect to its business and operations. Later that day, Mr. Jones provided\nMr. Psihas with a draft confidentiality agreement prepared by Arjun L. Kampani, Senior Vice President, General\nCounsel and Secretary of Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nOn May 6, 2020, as part of a regularly-scheduled meeting of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, Mr. Jones\nprovided a summary to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors of his various discussions with Lockheed Martin\nand Boeing, and noted that Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin agreed that a confidentiality agreement would\nbe appropriate in order to facilitate further discussions with Lockheed Martin.\nOn May 19, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin entered into a confidentiality agreement (the\n\u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d) that included, among other things, customary confidentiality provisions and a 15-\nmonth standstill provision prohibiting Lockheed Martin from engaging in certain types of actions, including making\nany acquisition proposal with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne (subject to certain exceptions), except that the\nConfidentiality Agreement did not restrict Lockheed Martin from initiating and engaging in private discussions with,\nand submitting certain confidential proposals to, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors. The Confidentiality\nAgreement also provided that the standstill provisions would terminate and be of no further effect upon the\noccurrence of certain fundamental change events.\nOn May 20, 2020, certain members of management of Aerojet Rocketdyne (including Ms. Drake, Mr. Jones, Paul R.\nLundstrom, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s then-current Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Kampani, and Mark Tucker, Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s then-current Senior Executive and former Chief Operating Officer) and representatives of Citi\nparticipated in a conference call with certain members of Lockheed Martin\u2019s management team (including Mr. Psihas),\nvarious representatives from Lockheed Martin\u2019s financial advisors, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d)\nand Ardea Partners LP (\u201cArdea\u201d), and representatives of Hogan Lovells US LLP (\u201cHogan Lovells\u201d), legal advisor to\nLockheed Martin. During this meeting, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management provided a presentation on Aerojet\nRocketdyne, which included an introduction to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s executive management team, a review of\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business, strategy and operations and a review of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Management\nPresentation Forecast (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 73), which was Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s then-current 10-year\nfinancial forecast and which was subsequently updated and superseded by a new forecast in the latter half of\nSeptember 2020. See the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information\u201d for a summary of this Management Presentation Forecast as well as other later forecasts.\nOver the course of the next few weeks, continuing into June 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne management and Citi provided\nadditional information, through written responses to questions and during conference calls, to Lockheed Martin and\nits representatives, including Goldman Sachs, Ardea and Hogan Lovells. In connection with that process,\nrepresentatives of Citi had multiple discussions with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Ardea.\nIn June 2020, Mr. Lichtenstein had a discussion with representatives of Evercore regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\npotential retention of Evercore as an additional financial advisor to Aerojet Rocketdyne and the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors to assist in analyzing an array of potential business and financial matters, including potential\nrecapitalization transactions and other strategic alternatives. Thereafter and continuing into July 2020, Mr.\nLichtenstein and representatives of Evercore had various discussions regarding various business and financial\nmatters. Other members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management also began to have preliminary discussions with\nrepresentatives of Evercore in late July 2020 regarding business and financial matters.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDuring the week of July 6, 2020, Ms. Drake had a telephone call with Frank A. St. John, Chief Operating Officer of\nLockheed Martin, to follow up on prior discussions and to inquire whether Lockheed Martin intended to submit a\ntransaction proposal to Aerojet Rocketdyne regarding a business combination transaction.\nOn July 14, 2020, Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas provided Ms. Drake, Mr. Jones and Mr. Lundstrom a presentation\nregarding Lockheed Martin\u2019s views regarding the strategic rationale, strategic fit and valuation of a potential\nbusiness combination transaction between Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin, and a preview of Lockheed\nMartin\u2019s preliminary merger proposal. The presentation described Lockheed Martin\u2019s view that Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nrevenues would grow at a substantially lower rate than was included in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s 10-year revenue\nprojections included in the Management Presentation Forecast. The presentation also indicated that while the loss of\nAerojet Rocketdyne profits on certain sales to Lockheed Martin as a result of government procurement laws would\nhave a negative impact on the value of the combined entity, Lockheed Martin had been able to identify significant\ncost and revenue synergy opportunities, which could potentially offset the profit loss. During this presentation, the\nLockheed Martin management team indicated that Lockheed Martin would be submitting to Aerojet Rocketdyne an\nindication of interest letter for an all-cash merger transaction at $47.50 per share.\nFollowing the presentation, Mr. Jones called Mr. Psihas and indicated that Aerojet Rocketdyne was extremely\ndisappointed in Lockheed Martin\u2019s $47.50 price per share offer and was not prepared to present it to the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors, as Aerojet Rocketdyne management believed that the offer was opportunistic based\non the recent stock market downturn and significantly undervalued Aerojet Rocketdyne in light of Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s business, prospects and position in the aerospace and defense industry. During this discussion, Mr.\nPsihas indicated to Mr. Jones that the indication of interest letter had already been sent.\nThe indication of interest letter from James D. Taiclet, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lockheed Martin, that\nwas delivered to Ms. Drake set forth a preliminary, non-binding proposal for the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne in\nan all-cash merger transaction at a price of $47.50 per share. The letter identified key elements of context for Lockheed\nMartin\u2019s diligence review and valuation framework with respect to a potential acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nAmong other things, Lockheed Martin reiterated the negative financial implications of the loss of Aerojet\nRocketdyne profits on sales to Lockheed Martin as a result of government procurement laws and its expectation that\nthere would be both cost and growth synergies available to Lockheed Martin to offset this economic reality.\nLockheed Martin also noted that there was long-term uncertainty in the Space Launch System (\u201cSLS\u201d) program of the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (\u201cNASA\u201d) as well as uncertainty regarding the number of\nhypersonics programs that ultimately would be funded through production. Aerojet Rocketdyne did not formally\nrespond in writing to the letter. Aerojet Rocketdyne management consulted with representatives of Citi in connection\nwith these matters.\nIn mid-July 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne and its management team began to analyze and focus on one or more potential\ncapital deployment transactions as alternatives to a strategic business combination transaction with Lockheed\nMartin or any other company.\nBetween July 14 and August 4, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne management and Citi engaged in discussions with\nLockheed Martin management and Lockheed Martin\u2019s financial advisors regarding Lockheed Martin\u2019s proposal and\nthe significant gap between the respective valuations of Aerojet Rocketdyne by Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed\nMartin. During these discussions, Aerojet Rocketdyne management and Citi provided additional information\nconcerning Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business and prospects.\nOn August 4, 2020, Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas provided an updated presentation to Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones, and\nindicated that Lockheed Martin would be delivering a revised merger proposal for an all-cash merger transaction at\n$52.00 per share. While Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas noted that the increased price reflected Lockheed Martin\u2019s better\nunderstanding of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business and financial forecast, they also noted that the price continued to\nreflect uncertainty regarding the SLS program and the number of hypersonics programs that would be funded over\nthe next 10 years. During this discussion, the Aerojet Rocketdyne management team noted to Mr. St. John and Mr.\nPsihas that they were again disappointed in Lockheed Martin\u2019s $52.00 per share offer, and that they believed it was\nstill opportunistic, inadequate and not sufficient to merit making a counterproposal or engaging in a negotiation, but\nthey indicated a willingness to provide certain additional financial information on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s strategic plan\nand the Management Presentation Forecast.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAfter the presentation, a letter from Mr. Taiclet was delivered to Ms. Drake setting forth a revised preliminary, non-\nbinding proposal for the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne in an all-cash merger transaction at a price of $52.00 per\nshare. Except for the proposed price per share, this August 4, 2020 letter was otherwise substantially similar to Mr.\nTaiclet\u2019s July 14, 2020 letter. Aerojet Rocketdyne management consulted with representatives of Citi concerning the\nterms of this revised proposal.\nOn August 5, 2020, at a regularly-scheduled meeting of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, Mr. Jones\npresented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors information regarding the indication of interest letter that\nAerojet Rocketdyne had received from Lockheed Martin on July 14, 2020 proposing an all-cash merger transaction at\n$47.50 per share, the subsequent discussions that Aerojet Rocketdyne management and Citi had with Lockheed\nMartin and its advisors during the past several weeks regarding the significant gap in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s and\nLockheed Martin\u2019s respective valuations of Aerojet Rocketdyne, the revised indication of interest letter Aerojet\nRocketdyne received from Lockheed Martin on August 4, 2020 proposing an all-cash merger transaction at $52.00 per\nshare and Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s views that Lockheed Martin\u2019s latest offer was still inadequate. Mr.\nJones also presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors information about various Aerojet Rocketdyne\nstrategic alternatives, including Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s organic growth plan, potential inorganic growth opportunities\nthrough acquisitions, and the likelihood that various potential merger and acquisition targets might be available to\nAerojet Rocketdyne. Aerojet Rocketdyne management also reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors\nmanagement\u2019s assessment of Lockheed Martin in comparison to other companies potentially interested in a business\ncombination with Aerojet Rocketdyne and management\u2019s view that Lockheed Martin represented the best fit for\nAerojet Rocketdyne from a business, synergy and timing perspective. Management reviewed with the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors management\u2019s views that (1) Company A, while potentially a good fit, had timing\nrestrictions, (2) Company B, while potentially a good fit, had timing issues due to various business challenges and\nhad other priorities, (3) Company C, while a moderate fit, was focused on other business areas and had low synergy\npotential, (4) Company D had some product overlap and unclear interest in the defense business, and (5) Company E\nhad timing issues due to various business challenges and had low synergy potential. After discussion, the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors confirmed that the $52.00 per share price offer from Lockheed Martin was inadequate\nand not sufficient to merit making a counterproposal or engaging in a negotiation with Lockheed Martin, and the\nAerojet Rocketdyne board of directors instructed management to proceed with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s organic growth\nplan while continuing to seek out and assess opportunities under its inorganic acquisition growth plan and consider\nthe timing of potentially approaching any other parties that might have potential interest in a strategic transaction\ninvolving Aerojet Rocketdyne. Management noted that it would reassess any revised indication of interest that\nLockheed Martin might submit in the future, at a higher price per share, and report on its analysis of any such revised\nindication of interest.\nOn August 7, 2020, Mr. Jones again communicated to Mr. Psihas that Lockheed Martin\u2019s $52.00 per share offer was\ninadequate and not sufficient to merit making a counterproposal or engaging in a negotiation. Aerojet Rocketdyne\ndid not otherwise respond to this letter, but Mr. Jones indicated to Mr. Psihas in the conversation that Aerojet\nRocketdyne believed that a price of at least $60.00 per share was justified. Aerojet Rocketdyne management then\ncontinued to focus on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s organic growth plan, potential capital deployment transactions and\nother alternatives to a strategic business combination transaction.\nOver the next couple of weeks, members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne senior management team, representatives of Citi\nand representatives of Lockheed Martin and its financial advisors engaged in discussions regarding Lockheed\nMartin\u2019s revised proposal from August 4, 2020 and the remaining significant gap between the respective valuations\nof Aerojet Rocketdyne by Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin. Mr. Jones also provided further information\nabout Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business and prospects to Mr. Psihas.\nOn August 14, 2020, Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones had a telephone call with Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas, and Mr. St. John\nand Mr. Psihas presented Lockheed Martin\u2019s views on various matters relating to a potential business combination\ntransaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin.\nBetween August 14, 2020 and August 17, 2020, members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management met with\nrepresentatives of Citi and two other financial advisors to conduct an assessment of the market, and Aerojet\nRocketdyne management received feedback from representatives of Citi and the other two financial advisors\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nregarding the likelihood that certain potential strategic buyers of Aerojet Rocketdyne would be interested in a\nstrategic transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne. During this time, Mr. Lichtenstein also had conversations with senior\nexecutives at Company A, Company C and Company D regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business and prospects.\nOn August 18, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors increased its size from seven to eight members and\nappointed Audrey A. McNiff as a director.\nOn August 27, 2020, Ms. Drake, Mr. Jones, Mr. Kampani, Tyler Evans, Senior Vice President, Defense Business Unit,\nJames Maser, Senior Vice President, Space Business Unit, and other members of Aerojet Rocketdyne senior\nmanagement had a discussion with and provided additional information to Mr. St. John, Mr. Psihas and other\nmembers of Lockheed Martin\u2019s management team concerning Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business, including its\nhypersonics and space exploration-related businesses. Aerojet Rocketdyne management also described additional\nemerging business opportunities that could potentially add, over a 10-year period, $500 million more revenue, and\nassociated profit and cash flow, to the Management Presentation Forecast that was previously provided in May 2020.\nThese additional opportunities were subsequently incorporated into the Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s Base\nCase Forecast (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 73) for Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business for the years 2020\nthrough 2029, which was provided to Lockheed Martin on September 18, 2020.\nOn August 31, 2020, Mr. Lichtenstein, Ms. Drake and other members of Aerojet Rocketdyne senior management had\na telephone call with Kenneth R. Possenriede, Chief Financial Officer of Lockheed Martin, Mr. St. John and Mr.\nPsihas, during which Mr. Lichtenstein indicated that Lockheed Martin\u2019s latest $52.00 per share price proposal was not\nsufficient and expressed a view that Aerojet Rocketdyne could be reasonably valued at a price of at least $60.00 per\nshare based on Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s then-current view of the Management Presentation Forecast as\ndiscussed during the August 27 discussion. During this conversation, Mr. Lichtenstein and members of Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s senior management provided further insights into Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business and prospects and\ntheir views about the inadequacy of the price offered pursuant to Lockheed Martin\u2019s two prior indication of interest\nletters. During the call, Mr. Psihas indicated that Lockheed Martin continued to have a differing view of Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s 10-year revenue projections in the Management Presentation Forecast.\nDuring September and the first half of October 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne management continued to evaluate,\nconsider and, in one case, implement various alternatives to a strategic business combination transaction. Aerojet\nRocketdyne management was focused on the effective utilization of the substantial amount of cash on its balance\nsheet, and therefore gave careful consideration to potential deployment of cash for alternative strategies, including\nthe deployment of capital for a special dividend, redemptions and repurchases of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s outstanding\nconvertible notes, a tender offer for shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock and repurchases of shares of\nAerojet Rocketdyne common stock pursuant to a share repurchase program that had been approved by the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors in March 2020, as well as the possibility of potential acquisitions by Aerojet\nRocketdyne of other businesses. From time to time during this period, Aerojet Rocketdyne sought advice from\noutside advisors regarding these strategic actions, including financial advice from two financial advisory firms and\nlegal advice from its outside securities counsel, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP (\u201cGibson Dunn\u201d) and Morrison &\nFoerster LLP (\u201cMorrison & Foerster\u201d), and its outside mergers and acquisitions and governance counsel, Jenner &\nBlock LLP (\u201cJenner & Block\u201d).\nBetween September 2 and September 14, 2020, Ms. Drake had several telephone calls with Mr. St. John, during which\nthey discussed the parties\u2019 respective positions on valuation and other issues relating to the terms and conditions of\nany potential transaction. On one of these calls on September 14, 2020, Mr. St. John informed Ms. Drake that the\nupper range of Lockheed Martin\u2019s assessment would not reach $60.00 per share. Ms. Drake reiterated the difference\nof views the two companies had on valuation. She indicated that she had no authority to negotiate below $60.00 per\nshare. She further indicated that, if there were a compelling offer, she would take it to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board\nof directors for consideration. Mr. St. John indicated that he would discuss the matter further with the Lockheed\nMartin board of directors later that month.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, on September 4, 2020, Mr. Jones had a conversation with a senior executive from Company A regarding a\npotential business combination transaction, as a follow-up to the conversation that Mr. Lichtenstein had with\nCompany A in mid-August 2020. Mr. Jones was informed by that senior executive that Company A was not in a\nposition to pursue a potential business combination involving Aerojet Rocketdyne at this time.\nOn September 9, 2020, Citi and Lockheed Martin\u2019s financial advisors from Goldman Sachs and Ardea had a call to\ndiscuss their respective approaches to the calculation of transaction multiples for a potential business combination\ntransaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin and other comparable transactions.\nOn September 18, 2020, Mr. Jones delivered an updated set of Aerojet Rocketdyne financial projections to Mr. Psihas.\nThese updated financial projections consisted of Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s Base Case Forecast (as defined\nin the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d\nbeginning on page 73) for Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business for the years 2020 through 2029, which was based upon\nand reflected, among other things, an assumption that the NASA SLS manifest would ramp up from one launch per\nyear to two launches per year beginning in 2028. See the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger -\nCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 73 for more information about these\nprojections. The Base Case Forecast was an update of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s 10-year Management Presentation\nForecast, with the addition of $500 million more revenue, and associated profit and cash flow, over the 10-year period\nfrom the emerging opportunities that were discussed between Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin on August\n27, 2020. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Jones had a telephone discussion with Mr. Psihas during which Mr. Jones reviewed\nthe Base Case Forecast in further detail. At the direction of Aerojet Rocketdyne management, Citi also delivered a\ncopy of the Base Case Forecast to Goldman Sachs and Ardea.\nOn September 30, 2020, Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones had a telephone call with Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas, during which\nMr. St. John communicated a revised indication of interest from Lockheed Martin proposing an acquisition of Aerojet\nRocketdyne in an all-cash merger transaction at a price of $56.00 per share, with the same non-price terms and\nconditions as had been communicated in Lockheed Martin\u2019s August 4 letter. Mr. St. John also noted that there would\nbe no financing contingency and that the proposal had the full support of the Lockheed Martin board of directors.\nFrom October 2020 through December 2020, various members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors had\nvarious meetings and calls from time to time with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management and, at times,\nrepresentatives of Citi, representatives of Evercore, representatives of Jenner & Block and/or representatives of\nGibson Dunn. A range of strategic and other matters were discussed from time to time with various members of the\nAerojet Rocketdyne board of directors including valuation matters, assessments of strategic alternatives to a\nbusiness combination transaction involving Lockheed Martin, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s standalone business plan and\nstrategy, the terms and conditions of a potential transaction involving Lockheed Martin, regulatory matters, and\nfiduciary considerations.\nOn October 2, 2020, Ms. Drake and Mr. St. John had another telephone call to discuss the parties\u2019 respective\npositions on valuation and other issues relating to the terms and conditions of any potential transaction involving\nthe two companies.\nOn October 8, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and certain\nmembers of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management attended the meeting. Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones updated the\nAerojet Rocketdyne board of directors regarding the further indication of interest communicated by Lockheed Martin\nto Ms. Drake on September 30 for an all-cash merger transaction at a price of $56.00 per share. In describing the\nfurther indication of interest, Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones noted that while the $56.00 per share price offered had been\nauthorized by the Lockheed Martin board of directors, they believed that it may not represent Lockheed Martin\u2019s\nbest and final offer, thus potentially leaving room for further negotiation of price. Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones then\nprovided a detailed review of Lockheed Martin\u2019s proposed terms and recapped for the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors the timeline of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s discussions with Lockheed Martin to date. In connection with this\nmeeting, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors was provided with (1) the Base Case Forecast and (2) a more\nconservative set of financial projections consisting of Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s Adjusted Base Case\nForecast (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information\u201d beginning on page 73) for Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business for the years 2020 through 2029\n(which was based upon and reflected an assumption that the NASA\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSLS manifest would remain at about one launch per year). See the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe\nMerger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 73 for more information about the\nBase Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast.\nAt this meeting, Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones then presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors an overview\nof the anticipated strategic opportunities and benefits from a potential combination with Lockheed Martin, along\nwith, among other things, an analysis of (1) Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s 10-year Base Case Forecast and Adjusted Base\nCase Forecast, (2) valuation matters and (3) potential Lockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne synergy\nopportunities. Aerojet Rocketdyne management also noted to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors\nmanagement\u2019s view about increasing uncertainty related to NASA\u2019s SLS launch manifest and human space\nexploration program. Aerojet Rocketdyne management also presented a preliminary downside risk-based sensitivity\nanalysis relating to the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, which downside analysis assumed that NASA\u2019s schedule for\nlanding a human presence on the moon could potentially be delayed and that space exploration-related new business\nmight not be funded or won at the same rate assumed in the Adjusted Base Case Forecast.\nAerojet Rocketdyne management then presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors information about\nvarious potential strategic combination alternatives, including Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s assessment of\nLockheed Martin in comparison to other companies that might potentially be interested in a business combination\nwith Aerojet Rocketdyne and management\u2019s view that Lockheed Martin continued to represent the best fit for\nAerojet Rocketdyne from a business, synergy and timing perspective. Management reviewed with the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors management\u2019s views that (1) Company A, while potentially a good fit, had timing\nrestrictions and had communicated that it was not in a position to pursue a transaction, (2) Company B, while\npotentially a good fit, had timing issues due to various business challenges and had other priorities, (3) Company C,\nwhile a moderate fit, was focused on other business areas and had low synergy potential, (4) Company D had some\nproduct overlap and no interest in the defense business, and (5) Company E had timing issues due to various\nbusiness challenges and had low synergy potential.\nAt this same meeting, Daniel L. Boehle, who had been appointed Chief Financial Officer of Aerojet Rocketdyne in\nAugust following Mr. Lundstrom\u2019s departure, then presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors multiple\npotential recapitalization and capital deployment alternatives Aerojet Rocketdyne could consider in lieu of a strategic\nbusiness combination transaction with Lockheed Martin or another company, including the redemption of Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s currently outstanding convertible notes and share repurchases. In connection with this discussion,\nMr. Boehle presented information on the status of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s share repurchase program, an overview of\nthe terms of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s outstanding convertible notes and a number of potential refinancing alternatives\nfor the notes, including a full or partial redemption of the notes using Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s cash on hand, a\nredemption of the notes using the proceeds of a new convertible note offering, term loan, high yield bond or other\ndebt issuance, or a privately-negotiated repurchase of a portion of the notes from various holders, and presented an\noverview of the pros and cons of these various potential alternatives. Management then presented various valuation\nmodels for various potential recapitalization scenarios, including a potential future sale of Aerojet Rocketdyne\nfollowing a recapitalization. Mr. Kampani provided to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors a summary of their\nfiduciary duties in connection with its consideration of these matters. Throughout these presentations the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors asked questions and discussed the issues. After further discussion, the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors directed that Aerojet Rocketdyne management provide further information about the\nassumptions and uncertainty underlying the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, a review of\nvarious strategic transactions Aerojet Rocketdyne could potentially consider and a review of potential\nrecapitalization and other capital deployment alternatives that Aerojet Rocketdyne could consider in lieu of a\nstrategic transaction.\nOn October 13, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met again to, among other things, receive an update\nfrom Aerojet Rocketdyne management about the matters requested at its October 8, 2020 meeting. All Aerojet\nRocketdyne directors and certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management attended the meeting. Mr.\nJones discussed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors further information about the modeling assumptions\nunderlying Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s 10-year Adjusted Base Case Forecast and an Aerojet Rocketdyne management\nvaluation model based on the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, each as previously presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors at its October 8, 2020 meeting. Aerojet Rocketdyne management then presented in further detail its\nviews regarding various growing risk factors and other\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nuncertainties present even in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s 10-year Adjusted Base Case Forecast, particularly the current\nhuman space exploration budgetary environment, management\u2019s view of the increasing uncertainty related to\nNASA\u2019s SLS launch manifest, potential future competition and uncertainties associated with a potential new\nPresidential administration. Management then provided additional information about the outlook for Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s Defense Business Unit. Mr. Jones then discussed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors an\nassessment of a possible sale of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Space Business Unit and Defense Business Unit operations in\nseparate transactions. Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones then discussed Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s proposed formal engagement\nof Citi and Evercore as financial advisors, the advisors\u2019 relevant experience and Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s proposed\napproach for the structuring of their respective fees and other terms and conditions of their engagements.\nAt this meeting, management then reviewed (1) the views of representatives of Citi and Evercore regarding the\nlikelihood that certain other companies would have interest in a strategic transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne,\n(2) Mr. Lichtenstein\u2019s preliminary conversations earlier in the year with senior executives at Company A (who\nsubsequently communicated that it was not in a position to pursue a transaction), Company C and Company D\nregarding Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business and prospects and (3) the potential of performing a more explicit market test\n(and related risks of leaks and any potential impact on the ongoing discussions with Lockheed Martin). Management\nalso reviewed a summary of the material potential transaction terms and conditions proposed by Lockheed Martin\nand Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s contemplated positions with respect to those terms and conditions, based on further\nassessment of the risks and uncertainties associated with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s forecasts in view of changing\ncircumstances. Mr. Kampani then reviewed a preliminary regulatory assessment of a potential transaction with\nLockheed Martin, and management discussed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors potential negotiation\nstrategies for engaging with Lockheed Martin, with a view towards achieving an offer of a higher price per share.\nAt this meeting, Aerojet Rocketdyne management then further reviewed various business, financial and legal\nconsiderations relating to potential recapitalization transactions and other capital deployment alternatives that\nAerojet Rocketdyne could consider pursuing in lieu of a strategic business combination. Management\u2019s review\naddressed, among other things, various mechanisms and legal requirements relating to a redemption of Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s outstanding convertible notes, various legal requirements and other considerations relating to\nprivately-negotiated repurchases of the notes, mechanisms and legal requirements relating to a tender offer for\nAerojet Rocketdyne shares, and considerations relating to the Aerojet Rocketdyne share repurchase program and\nother share repurchases. Management also discussed valuation, timing and other risks, uncertainties and\nconsiderations relating to any decision to defer a potential business combination transaction (including a potential\ntransaction with Lockheed Martin) until after the completion of a recapitalization transaction, and various other\ndisclosure and other legal considerations relating to a potential recapitalization transaction. Mr. Kampani reminded\nthe Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors of its fiduciary obligations in connection with consideration of the matters\ndiscussed at this meeting and reviewed various fiduciary considerations.\nIt was at this meeting that the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors confirmed, based on its assessment of the\nrelative risks and uncertainties associated with its business (particularly management\u2019s view of increasing\nuncertainty related to NASA\u2019s SLS launch manifest and potential shifting priorities in space exploration under a\npotential new Presidential administration) and available alternative capital deployment and other strategies, that\nAerojet Rocketdyne should shift its focus to pursue in earnest a transaction involving Lockheed Martin, but at a\nhigher price than currently offered at that time by Lockheed Martin. The Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors also\ndetermined that it would be useful to have the benefit of multiple advisory perspectives, including in respect of\nvaluation matters, the market generally and other companies potentially interested in a business combination\ntransaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne. Throughout these presentations the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors asked questions and discussed the issues. After discussion, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors\nthen directed that management (1) review further with the assistance of outside advisors any financial and legal\nconsiderations regarding a potential near-term recapitalization or other capital deployment transaction, (2) pursue in\nearnest the possibility of a transaction with Lockheed Martin and begin negotiations to seek a higher price than\nLockheed Martin\u2019s September 30 indication of interest, based on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s then-current belief that $56.00\nper share may not represent the best and final offer from Lockheed Martin, and (3) finalize the terms\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s formal engagement of each of Citi and Evercore as financial advisors and have those\nadvisors review with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors their respective preliminary financial analyses of\nAerojet Rocketdyne and potential strategic alternatives to a potential business combination with Lockheed Martin.\nOn October 14, 2020, Mr. Kampani conferred with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s outside securities counsel at Gibson Dunn\nand Morrison & Foerster regarding legal considerations pertaining to recapitalization and other transactions, as well\nas other matters. Management of Aerojet Rocketdyne also consulted with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s financial advisors\nregarding financial considerations relating to recapitalization and other transactions that Aerojet Rocketdyne might\nconsider.\nOn October 15, 2020, Mr. St. John contacted Ms. Drake to inform her that the Lockheed Martin board of directors\nwould be meeting on October 23, 2020, and that the Lockheed Martin board of directors would want Lockheed Martin\nto either begin confirmatory due diligence on Aerojet Rocketdyne or move on to other strategic initiatives.\nOn October 17, 2020 and October 19, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into engagement letter agreements with Citi\nand Evercore, respectively.\nOn October 18, 2020, Mr. St. John contacted Ms. Drake to reiterate that Lockheed Martin\u2019s latest offer of $56.00 per\nshare was at the top end of its valuation.\nOn October 19, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met again. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and\ncertain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management attended the meeting, and representatives of Citi and\nEvercore attended portions of the meeting. Mr. Lichtenstein commented on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s transaction review\nprocess and provided an update regarding the engagement of Citi and Evercore as financial advisors.\nRepresentatives of Citi and Evercore then reviewed their respective preliminary financial analyses of Aerojet\nRocketdyne, as well as their views on other potential buyers of Aerojet Rocketdyne. A discussion then ensued\namong the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management and the financial\nadvisors regarding the analyses presented, and strategic considerations in terms of next steps in the transaction\nprocess and further discussions with Lockheed Martin regarding a potential transaction. Management of Aerojet\nRocketdyne also reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors management\u2019s plan to commence\nnegotiations with Lockheed Martin on price and submit a non-binding counterproposal for a $60.00 per share\ntransaction that would involve (1) Lockheed Martin\u2019s issuance of $55.00 per share of Lockheed Martin stock at\nclosing (subject to a 10% collar) in exchange for each share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock and (2) Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s payment of a $5.00 per share cash dividend shortly after public announcement of the transaction,\nsubject to further discussion amongst both parties\u2019 advisors concerning the allocation of regulatory approval risk\nand other key transaction terms. The dividend was intended to accelerate the delivery of cash to Aerojet Rocketdyne\nstockholders prior to a transaction closing. The Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors authorized management to\nsubmit the proposed non-binding counterproposal to Lockheed Martin. At the meeting, the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors also approved and ratified the engagement of Citi and Evercore. Prior to approving and ratifying\nthose engagements, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors considered the written disclosures from Citi and\nEvercore, respectively, regarding their respective material relationships with Lockheed Martin.\nOn October 20, 2020, Ms. Drake spoke with Mr. St. John via telephone and communicated Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s non-\nbinding counterproposal that had been approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors the previous day as\ndetailed in the prior paragraph. Ms. Drake followed up with a letter that same day to Mr. St. John that further\ndescribed the terms and conditions of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s non-binding counterproposal. The letter also noted that\nat this price, Aerojet Rocketdyne would consider a break-up fee at the higher end of the customary range. The letter\nfurther indicated that Aerojet Rocketdyne sought Lockheed Martin stock as consideration because it believed in the\nprospects for success of the combined businesses and because equity, rather than cash, consideration would\nprovide a tax advantage for Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s stockholders. Finally, the letter noted that an appropriate efforts\nprovision and appropriate remedial commitments from Lockheed Martin related to regulatory review would need to be\nincluded in the merger agreement and that a customary \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provision would also need to be included in\nthe merger agreement.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn October 21, 2020, Mr. St. John contacted Ms. Drake to inform her that Lockheed Martin had reviewed her letter\nand that the counterproposal was not acceptable, including the contemplation of stock as a form of consideration.\nMr. St. John also reiterated that Lockheed Martin would not agree to a $60.00 per share price and that the only path to\ncontinue discussions would be if the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors could support a transaction at a price\nbelow $60.00 per share.\nLater that day on October 21, 2020, Ms. Drake spoke by telephone with Mr. St. John, who again relayed Lockheed\nMartin\u2019s disappointment that Aerojet Rocketdyne had not reduced its required price below $60.00 per share. Ms.\nDrake asked Mr. St. John to take the Aerojet Rocketdyne counterproposal to the Lockheed Martin board of directors,\nand Mr. St. John indicated that if Aerojet Rocketdyne was not willing to make any price movement he would\ncommunicate to the Lockheed Martin board of directors that discussions may come to an end.\nOn October 22, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met and was provided an update on the current state\nof Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s discussions with Lockheed Martin. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and certain members\nof Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management attended the meeting, and representatives of Citi and Evercore attended\na portion of the meeting. Ms. Drake provided details on her latest discussions with Lockheed Martin, including\nLockheed Martin\u2019s rejection of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s October 20 counterproposal, and the Aerojet Rocketdyne board\nof directors discussed whether to continue to pursue negotiations with Lockheed Martin or consider other initiatives.\nRepresentatives of Citi and Evercore then discussed their views on potential next steps in the transaction process\nand further discussions with Lockheed Martin and other transaction-related considerations.\nOn October 24, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met again. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and\ncertain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management attended the meeting, and representatives of Citi,\nEvercore and Jenner & Block attended portions of the meeting. Management discussed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors various transaction structuring and related considerations, including appropriate remedial\ncommitments from Lockheed Martin pertaining to regulatory matters that could be included in a merger agreement.\nMr. Kampani provided to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors a summary of their fiduciary duties, and\nrepresentatives of Jenner & Block further commented on the directors\u2019 fiduciary obligations in the context of their\nconsideration of any potential transactions. Representatives of Jenner & Block also commented on transaction\nstructuring matters and deal terms considerations. After further discussion, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors unanimously authorized management to submit to Lockheed Martin a non-binding counterproposal for a\n$58.00 per share (50% cash and 50% stock) transaction containing the following terms: (1) allowance for Aerojet\nRocketdyne to issue up to a $5.00 cash dividend (which would reduce the purchase price on a dollar-for-dollar basis\nby the amount of the dividend)\u037e (2) a ticking fee of $0.25 per share per month if regulatory approval would exceed six\nmonths from signing\u037e and (3) the stock consideration portion of the purchase price would be subject to a +/- 10%\ncollar (with a floating exchange ratio within the collar and fixed exchange ratio outside the collar).\nOn October 26, 2020, Ms. Drake delivered a letter to Mr. St. John communicating Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s revised non-\nbinding counterproposal that had been approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors on October 24,\nincluding the financial terms as outlined in the prior paragraph. The letter also communicated information relating to\nthe capitalization of Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nOn October 26, 2020, Ms. Drake and Mr. St. John discussed Ms. Drake\u2019s October 26 letter to Mr. St. John. Mr. St. John\nstated that he was unable to commit to accepting a price of $58.00 per share, but he would take the proposal to the\nLockheed Martin board of directors. Mr. St. John indicated that any dividend payment would need to reduce the\npurchase price on a dollar-for-dollar basis and that he was opposed to Lockheed Martin issuing stock as part of the\nmerger consideration.\nOn October 30, 2020, Mr. Jones had a telephone call with Mr. Psihas, during which Mr. Psihas indicated that\nLockheed Martin would be sending a letter to Aerojet Rocketdyne reflecting their best and final offer of $56.00 per\nshare. Later that day on October 30, 2020, Mr. Taiclet delivered to Ms. Drake a letter setting forth an updated non-\nbinding acquisition proposal from Lockheed Martin. The letter indicated that Lockheed Martin was not prepared to\nproceed based on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s most recent counterproposal, and that Lockheed Martin wished to make a\nfinal attempt to communicate the basis on which Lockheed Martin was prepared to proceed with a transaction. The\nletter stated that it replaced in its entirety the earlier proposals included in Lockheed\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMartin\u2019s letters dated July 14, 2020 and August 4, 2020, and superseded the views expressed by Mr. St. John in his\ndiscussions with Ms. Drake on September 30, 2020. The letter stated that Lockheed Martin\u2019s final proposal would be\nan all-cash merger at a price of $56.00 per share, and that Lockheed Martin was not prepared to offer stock\nconsideration or to include a ticking fee. It did, however, state that Lockheed Martin was prepared to include\nprovisions giving Aerojet Rocketdyne the option of declaring a special cash dividend of up to $5.00 per share at the\ntime a transaction would be announced, and that if such a dividend was declared, the cash consideration at the\nclosing of the merger would be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of the dividend. Similar to\nLockheed Martin\u2019s July 14 and August 4 letters, the letter also identified key elements underlying Lockheed Martin\u2019s\nvaluation framework with respect to a potential acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne, including an explanation that\nLockheed Martin projected a lower growth rate for Aerojet Rocketdyne than was included in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nBase Case Forecast. The October 30, 2020 letter also outlined the remedies and restrictions to which Lockheed Martin\nwould be willing to agree in the context of regulatory approval of such a transaction.\nOn November 2, 2020, Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones had a telephone call with Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas regarding the\nterms of Lockheed Martin\u2019s revised proposal and related matters.\nOn November 2, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met again. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and\ncertain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management attended the meeting, and representatives of Citi,\nEvercore and Jenner & Block attended portions of the meeting. Ms. Drake provided the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors an update on Mr. Lichtenstein\u2019s and Ms. Drake\u2019s recent discussions about desirable parameters of a\npotential counterproposal of $57.00 per share that Aerojet Rocketdyne could make to Lockheed Martin in response to\nits indication of interest for an all-cash merger transaction at $56.00 per share. Ms. Drake also provided an update on\nher and Mr. Jones\u2019 recent call with Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas. Mr. Lichtenstein then provided a further overview of\ndiscussions over the weekend among Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management, representatives of Citi and Evercore and\nother members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors. Management then presented an overview and analysis\nof Lockheed Martin\u2019s current indication of interest at a $56.00 per share price, including a comparison of key metrics\nof a potential Aerojet Rocketdyne / Lockheed Martin transaction at $56.00 per share to those metrics as reflected in\nthe 2018 Northrop Grumman / Orbital ATK transaction. Management also reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors management\u2019s views on increasing risks to and uncertainties associated with the Adjusted Base\nCase Forecast, with a particular focus on growing uncertainties to Aerojet Rocketdyne regarding NASA\u2019s Space\nExploration (Artemis) Program, including potential shifting priorities in space exploration under a potential new\nPresidential administration. Aerojet Rocketdyne management reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors, among other things, (1) the fact that NASA\u2019s Artemis-related business accounted for approximately 25% of\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s annual revenues, and (2) Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s view about increasing uncertainty\nrelated to NASA\u2019s SLS launch manifest and space exploration program and that the schedule for landing a human\npresence on the moon could potentially be delayed, which schedule delay could result in greater competitive\npressure on Aerojet Rocketdyne from new competitive entrants into Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s industry.\nIn connection with this meeting, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors was provided with (1) another copy of\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s 10-year Adjusted Base Case Forecast and (2) Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s Risk\nAdjusted Case Analysis (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 73), which represented a downside risk-based\nsensitivity analysis prepared by Aerojet Rocketdyne management in respect of the Adjusted Base Case Forecast\ntaking into account Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s evolving and expanding view that there was growing\nuncertainty in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s space exploration business prospects. See the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 73. Aerojet\nRocketdyne management also reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s 10-\nyear Adjusted Base Case Forecast and Risk Adjusted Case Analysis and Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s view\nthat a $56.00 per share price was at the top end of management\u2019s valuation range based on the Risk Adjusted Case\nAnalysis and within management\u2019s valuation range based on the Adjusted Base Case Forecast.\nRepresentatives of Citi and Evercore then reviewed their respective preliminary financial analyses of Aerojet\nRocketdyne, and a discussion ensued regarding the analyses presented, and strategy in terms of next steps with\nLockheed Martin. Mr. Kampani provided the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors a summary of their fiduciary\nduties, and representatives of Jenner & Block further commented on the directors\u2019 fiduciary obligations in the\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncontext of a potential transaction, including by referencing prior discussions of these matters with the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors. A discussion of the proposed deal terms and conditions and required regulatory\napprovals ensued, with representatives of Jenner & Block, Citi and Evercore commenting on such matters,\ncontemplated transaction execution timelines and other related items.\nAfter further discussion, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors unanimously approved management\u2019s\nrecommendation to authorize Ms. Drake to submit to Lockheed Martin a non-binding counterproposal for an all-cash\ntransaction at a $57.00 price per share or, if such a higher price could not be achieved, a $56.00 price per share, with\nany discussions and negotiations for a $56.00 per share transaction to include an Aerojet Rocketdyne request for a\nlower break-up fee. In connection therewith, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors noted its belief that, in light\nof its assessment of the value of Aerojet Rocketdyne, the substantial premium of each such price to Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s then-current trading price and its consideration of certain risks and uncertainties associated with\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s projected performance (particularly in the space exploration sector), either price would\nrepresent a significant value enhancement for Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders and be in their best interests.\nOn November 3, 2020, Ms. Drake delivered a letter (dated November 2, 2020) to Mr. Taiclet communicating Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s latest non-binding counterproposal for a $57.00 per share all-cash merger transaction. The letter noted\nthat the merger agreement would need to include provisions giving Aerojet Rocketdyne the option of declaring a\nspecial cash dividend of up to $5.00 per share at the time a transaction is announced, provided that if such a dividend\nis declared and paid the cash consideration delivered to Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders at closing would be\nreduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such dividend. The letter also noted that Aerojet Rocketdyne\nwould want to include in the merger agreement appropriate efforts provisions and appropriate regulatory remedial\ncommitments from Lockheed Martin. The letter further indicated that Lockheed Martin would have no financing\ncontingency and that a customary \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provision would be included in the merger agreement.\nOn November 10, 2020, Ms. Drake contacted Mr. St. John by telephone to discuss the status of Lockheed Martin\u2019s\nconsideration of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s latest proposal. Mr. St. John indicated that the Lockheed Martin management\nteam had engaged in numerous conversations, including with the Lockheed Martin board of directors, and that\nLockheed Martin management team believed that their previous $56.00 per share offer price remained at the high end\nof the valuation range and that they were unable to change their valuation position. Ms. Drake reiterated the counter-\noffer of $57.00 per share, but Mr. St. John stated that he was directed to send Aerojet Rocketdyne a letter affirming\ntheir $56.00 per share offer.\nOn November 12, 2020, Ms. Drake received a letter (dated November 10, 2020) from Mr. Taiclet responding to Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s November 2, 2020 counterproposal. The letter noted that Lockheed Martin was prepared to proceed\nwith confirmatory due diligence and to negotiate a definitive merger agreement at an all-cash price of $56.00 on the\nterms set forth in that letter. The letter also stated that Lockheed Martin\u2019s price was firm and that it believed its\nproposal reflected appropriately the risk to and uncertainty associated with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Base Case\nForecast. On that same date, Ms. Drake communicated to Mr. St. John that the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors\nwould be meeting the next day.\nOn November 13, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors held a meeting. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors\nand certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management attended the meeting. Ms. Drake reviewed her\nrecent discussions with Mr. St. John and the recent letter she had received from Lockheed Martin, which indicated\nthat Lockheed Martin would only pursue a transaction at a price of $56.00 per share and that Lockheed Martin\u2019s price\nwas firm. Management then reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors certain deal protection\nprovisions, including termination fee amounts, contained in various merger agreements for recent transactions\ninvolving companies in the aerospace and defense industry. At this meeting, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors confirmed that, consistent with its prior deliberations, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors was\nprepared to move forward with an all-cash merger transaction with Lockheed Martin (with appropriate terms and\nconditions) at a price of $56.00 per share. In connection therewith, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors noted\nits belief that, in light of its assessment of the value of Aerojet Rocketdyne, the substantial premium of such price to\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s then-current trading price and its consideration of certain risks and uncertainties associated\nwith Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s projected performance (particularly uncertainties in the space exploration sector), this\nprice would represent a significant value enhancement for Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders and be in their best\ninterests.\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin then continued discussions based on an all-cash merger transaction at a\nprice of $56.00 per share with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors having the ability to declare a special cash\ndividend of up to $5.00 per share (which dividend would reduce the per share purchase price on a dollar-for-dollar\nbasis), subject to the parties reaching agreement on other terms and conditions of a potential transaction.\nOn November 14, 2020, Mr. Jones had a telephone call with Mr. Psihas to discuss various key terms and provisions to\nbe contained in the merger agreement, including Lockheed Martin\u2019s required remedial measures related to regulatory\nclearance, the \u201cno-shop\u201d and \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provisions, and related break-up fee provisions.\nOn November 16, 2020, members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management and members of Lockheed Martin management\nhad a further discussion concerning various key terms and conditions to be included in the merger agreement.\nAmong other things, Aerojet Rocketdyne indicated to Lockheed Martin that Aerojet Rocketdyne expected that the\nmerger agreement would contain a customary \u201cfiduciary out\u201d to any \u201cno-shop\u201d provision included in the merger\nagreement. Aerojet Rocketdyne also proposed that the break-up fee that would be payable by Aerojet Rocketdyne\nupon any termination of the merger agreement for certain customary events would be on the low end of the\ncustomary range of break-up fees, measured as a percentage of equity value represented in the transaction. Lockheed\nMartin responded that such a low break-up fee was not acceptable to it in light of the substantial premium it believed\nwas represented by its $56.00 per share offer price in relation to the recent trading prices of Aerojet Rocketdyne\nstock.\nOn November 17, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Jenner & Block, Hogan Lovells and\nMcDermott, Will & Emery LLP (\u201cMcDermott Will\u201d), antitrust counsel to Lockheed Martin, had a further discussion\nabout various key deal points, including the level of the break-up fee that was appropriate under the circumstances.\nIn the context of these discussions, a representative of Lockheed Martin indicated that if Aerojet Rocketdyne were to\ncontact other potential buyers at this time, Lockheed Martin would immediately terminate its merger discussions with\nAerojet Rocketdyne. The parties also discussed Lockheed Martin\u2019s required efforts and remedial measures related to\nregulatory clearance.\nLater that same day on November 17, 2020, certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management and the independent\nmembers of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors had a discussion with representatives of Citi, Evercore and\nJenner & Block to review the open material transaction terms and conditions and the status of the merger discussions\nwith Lockheed Martin, including Lockheed Martin\u2019s refusal to accept Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s request for a lower break-\nup fee. The independent directors were further advised by Aerojet Rocketdyne management of Lockheed Martin\u2019s\nassertion that it would retract its offer and cease discussions if Aerojet Rocketdyne were to conduct any further\nmarket check at this time. Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s financial advisors also discussed their views regarding whether\ncertain companies in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s industry (including Company B) would likely be interested in pursuing a\npotential business combination transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne. Based on this discussion and other information\npreviously reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, the independent directors believed that it was\nunlikely that there were other viable counterparties for a potential business combination involving Aerojet\nRocketdyne. The independent directors and representatives of Citi and Evercore also discussed the risk that new\ncompetitive entrants could disrupt Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s industry, which could result in a negative impact on Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s business and standalone value. As part of this discussion, the independent directors also considered\nthe level of break-up fees in a number of recent merger transactions, including merger transactions in the aerospace\nand defense industry. At this time, the independent directors of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors\nconsidered the level of a break-up fee in the context of any transaction involving Lockheed Martin and determined,\nbased on its consideration and evaluation of input from Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s financial and legal advisors, that a\nbreak-up fee at the level proposed by Lockheed Martin fell within the generally acceptable range of customary break-\nup fees and would not likely preclude a potentially superior proposal for the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nOn November 19, 2020, Mr. Psihas sent an email to Mr. Jones purporting to reiterate Lockheed Martin\u2019s\nunderstanding of various conversations over the past week on a number of items, including a price of $56 per share\n(subject to dollar-for-dollar reduction for any dividend). Mr. Psihas\u2019 email also noted that in order to facilitate\nregulatory clearance for the proposed transaction, Lockheed Martin was prepared to take certain remedial measures if\nnecessary to obtain clearance, but that Lockheed Martin would not agree to a reverse break-up fee in the context of a\nfailure to obtain regulatory approval, which Aerojet Rocketdyne had proposed.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe email also noted that Lockheed Martin expected a break-up fee at a level based on at least 3% of the equity value\nof the transaction (including any special cash dividend that Aerojet Rocketdyne may declare), and that it anticipated\nthat the members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors would execute voting and support agreements and\nthat a similar voting and support agreement would be sought from one of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s stockholders, Steel\nPartners Holdings L.P. (\u201cSteel Partners\u201d).\nOn November 20, 2020, Mr. Jones responded to Mr. Psihas that Aerojet Rocketdyne agreed that his email addressed\nthe parties\u2019 prior discussions around the price and dividend and the general contours of antitrust-related covenants,\nbut rejected the requirement of voting and support agreements from Steel Partners and the Aerojet Rocketdyne\ndirectors. Mr. Jones then outlined the process and timing of allowing Lockheed Martin to proceed with its\nconfirmatory due diligence and also noted that Aerojet Rocketdyne believed that the transaction process would best\nbe advanced by Lockheed Martin sending Aerojet Rocketdyne its proposed draft merger agreement, which Lockheed\nMartin had previously indicated was in process, and that all remaining issues would need to be resolved in the\ntotality of the deal terms and conditions as embodied in the merger agreement.\nShortly thereafter, on November 20, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne provided various Lockheed Martin\nrepresentatives access to a virtual data room so that Lockheed Martin could begin its confirmatory due diligence.\nDuring the course of Lockheed Martin\u2019s confirmatory due diligence, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne had\nvarious discussions with representatives of Lockheed Martin regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business, operations,\nfinancial performance and financial outlook, including Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s then-current forecasts and related\nuncertainties associated with NASA\u2019s human space exploration program.\nOn November 30, 2020, Hogan Lovells delivered to Jenner & Block a draft Merger Agreement along with a draft of a\nform of voting and support agreement, which Lockheed Martin indicated they expected would be executed by each of\nthe Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and Steel Partners.\nOn December 3, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Jenner & Block and Hogan Lovells\nheld a teleconference to discuss various key issues that Aerojet Rocketdyne and its representatives had identified\nbased on their review of the draft Merger Agreement and the draft form of voting and support agreement. The key\nissues discussed included Lockheed Martin\u2019s request that the Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and Steel Partners sign\nvoting and support agreements, the proposed terms of the \u201cno-shop\u201d covenant and related \u201cfiduciary out\u201d and other\nprovisions that would give the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors flexibility to comply with its fiduciary duties in\nthe event a third party were to submit a proposal for a potentially superior transaction, the proposed requirement that\nAerojet Rocketdyne redeem its outstanding convertible notes promptly after redemption becomes permissible under\nthe related indenture, the scope of Lockheed Martin\u2019s remedial commitments related to regulatory review, the scope\nof various Lockheed Martin termination rights, Lockheed Martin\u2019s proposed $150 million termination fee and the\ncircumstances under which Aerojet Rocketdyne would become obligated to pay the termination fee, and the scope of\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s representations and warranties and interim operating covenants.\nOn December 5, 2020, Jenner & Block delivered to Hogan Lovells a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, reflecting\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s position on the key open issues.\nOn December 8, 2020, Hogan Lovells delivered to Jenner & Block a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, reflecting\nLockheed Martin\u2019s response to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s positions on the issues.\nOn December 9, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Jenner & Block and Hogan Lovells\nheld a teleconference to discuss various key issues that Aerojet Rocketdyne and its representatives had identified\nbased on their review of the latest draft of the Merger Agreement. The key issues that were discussed included\nLockheed Martin\u2019s continuing request that each of the Aerojet Rocketdyne directors (but no other stockholder) sign\nvoting and support agreements, the scope of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s representations and warranties, the proposed\nscope and substance of the interim operating covenants, the proposed terms of the \u201cno-shop\u201d covenant and related\n\u201cfiduciary out\u201d and other provisions that would give the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors appropriate flexibility\nto comply with its fiduciary duties in the event a third party were to submit a proposal for a potentially superior\ntransaction, the proposed scope of remedial commitments related to regulatory review, the conditions to Lockheed\nMartin\u2019s obligation to close the Merger, the scope of various Lockheed Martin termination rights and Lockheed\nMartin\u2019s proposed $150 million termination fee and the circumstances under which Aerojet Rocketdyne would\nbecome obligated to pay such a fee.\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 10, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met to consider the status of the potential\ntransaction. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors attended the meeting, and certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nsenior management and representatives of Citi, Evercore and Jenner & Block attended portions of the meeting. Mr.\nJones provided an update on the transaction process and the status of Lockheed Martin\u2019s confirmatory due diligence\nreview. Mr. Boehle and Mr. Kampani then provided an overview of the process and timing for the declaration and\npayment of the $5.00 per share special cash dividend being contemplated in connection with the signing of the\nMerger Agreement. Mr. Kampani then reviewed the status of the negotiations with Lockheed Martin on the proposed\nMerger Agreement and the key terms and provisions reflected in the latest draft of the Merger Agreement, including\nthe \u201cno-shop\u201d and \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provisions, the interim operations covenants, Lockheed Martin\u2019s closing\nconditions and various termination and break-up fee payment provisions. Mr. Kampani also noted that Lockheed\nMartin had not yet dropped its request that all members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors execute voting\nand support agreements with Lockheed Martin in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement and that\nfurther Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors discussion of the terms of such agreements may be needed if\nLockheed Martin continued to insist on those agreements as part of the Merger transaction. Mr. Kampani then\nreviewed various regulatory considerations and the related provisions being negotiated in the Merger Agreement.\nAndreas Wagner, Chief Human Resources Officer of Aerojet Rocketdyne, provided an overview of the employee\nretention arrangements anticipated to be adopted in connection with the Merger Agreement and intended to help\nensure appropriate management continuity pending the closing of the Merger transaction. Throughout these\npresentations the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors asked questions and discussed the issues. In an executive\nsession of this Board meeting, representatives of Jenner & Block also reviewed certain legal considerations in\nconnection with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors\u2019 consideration of the Merger. This session included a\nreview and discussion of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors\u2019 fiduciary obligations in connection with its\nconsideration of these matters, including deal protection terms that might be included in the Merger Agreement.\nFollowing the executive session, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors directed Aerojet Rocketdyne\nmanagement to continue negotiating the Merger Agreement as discussed during the meeting.\nOn December 12, 2020, Jenner & Block delivered to Hogan Lovells a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, reflecting\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s position on the open issues.\nOn December 13, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin executed a Supplemental Confidentiality\nAgreement Governing the Establishment of a \u201cClean Team,\u201d effective as of December 6, 2020, by and between\nAerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin to set forth certain procedures and restrictions in respect of the sharing of\ncertain competitively sensitive information.\nAlso on December 13, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Jenner & Block and Hogan\nLovells had a lengthy negotiation session on the Merger Agreement. Key issues remaining unresolved after that\nsession included Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s flexibility to issue equity and other compensatory awards to various\nemployees and officers in 2021, the scope and terms of a transaction bonus pool that Aerojet Rocketdyne would\nissue in order to incentivize and reward employees through the closing of the Merger, the proposed terms of the \u201cno-\nshop\u201d covenant and related \u201cfiduciary out\u201d and other provisions that would give the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors flexibility to comply with its fiduciary duties in the event a third party were to submit a proposal for a\npotentially superior transaction, the scope of Lockheed Martin\u2019s remedial commitments related to regulatory review,\ncertain conditions to Lockheed Martin\u2019s obligation to close the Merger, the scope of various Lockheed Martin\ntermination rights and the circumstances under which Aerojet Rocketdyne would become obligated to pay a\ntermination fee.\nBetween December 13 and December 18, 2020, representatives of Jenner & Block, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP\n(\u201cFreshfields\u201d) (additional antitrust counsel to Aerojet Rocketdyne) and McDermott Will had further discussions\nregarding regulatory-related provisions in the Merger Agreement.\nOn December 14, 2020, the Organization & Compensation Committee of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors\n(the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d) held a meeting with certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management\nand invited advisors, including a representative of Jenner & Block and a representative of the Compensation\nCommittee\u2019s outside compensation consultant, to review and consider information about change in control tax issues\nrelated to executive compensation as well as proposed actions to mitigate adverse effects on executives and Aerojet\nRocketdyne.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 16, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Jenner & Block, Hogan Lovells and\nMcDermott Will had a number of telephone conferences to negotiate open issues relating to the Merger Agreement.\nSeveral issues were resolved during these discussions, including the terms of the \u201cno-shop\u201d and \u201cfiduciary out\u201d and\nother provisions designed to provide the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors appropriate flexibility to comply with\nits fiduciary duties if a potentially superior proposal were to arise after the signing of the Merger Agreement and prior\nto the receipt of the requisite stockholder vote, and Lockheed Martin withdrew its request that Aerojet Rocketdyne\ndirectors execute voting and support agreements.\nOn December 17, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met again to consider the status of the potential\nMerger transaction. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors, certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Citi, Evercore and Jenner & Block attended the meeting.

The discussion in this section is\nnot intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors, but rather includes the material factors considered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors. In view of\nthe wide variety of factors considered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors in connection with its evaluation\nof the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors did not consider it\npracticable, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it\nconsidered in reaching its decision. In addition, individual members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors\nmay have given different weight to different factors. The Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors made its\nrecommendation based on the totality of the information available to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors,\nincluding discussions with, and questioning of, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management and legal counsel and financial\nadvisors.\nThe Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors considered, among other things, the following factors as supporting its\ndecision to recommend that Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement:\n\u2022\nthe per share merger consideration of $56.00, which is expected to be reduced to $51.00 per share after the\npayment of the $5.00 per share Pre-Closing Dividend, constitutes a premium of:\n\u25cb\n33.2% over the closing price of shares of Aerojet

approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors.\n\u2022\nthe Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors\u2019 belief, based on discussions and negotiations among members\nof Aerojet Rocketdyne

subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi as described in Citi\u2019s\nwritten opinion, the merger consideration of $56.00 per share minus, to the extent paid, the amount per\nshare of the Pre-Closing Dividend, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Aerojet\nRocketdyne

including the deployment of\ncapital for potential redemptions and repurchases of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s outstanding convertible notes,\na tender offer for Aerojet Rocketdyne shares or other share repurchases, or undertaking other potential\nstrategic initiatives) and the timing and likelihood of actually achieving additional value for stockholders\nfrom these alternatives, that none of these

not expose them to any future risks and uncertainties related to the\nbusiness or the financial markets generally, as compared to a transaction in which stockholders receive\nequity or other securities, or as compared to Aerojet Rocketdyne remaining independent)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the price Lockheed Martin will pay to Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders was the result of\nextensive

any\ngrowth or share gains with current customers, and any increase in demand from customers in the industries\nin which Aerojet Rocketdyne operates.\nIn addition to considering the factors described

With respect to each of the\nAerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts and other information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne provided to or\notherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citi, Citi was advised by the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that such\nforecasts and other information and data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne as to the future financial performance of Aerojet\nRocketdyne under the scenario reflected therein.\nCiti assumed, with the consent of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, that the proposed Merger would be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms, conditions and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, without\nwaiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining\nthe necessary regulatory or third-party approvals, consents and releases for the proposed Merger, no delay,\nlimitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Merger meaningful to\nits opinion and analysis. Representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne advised Citi, and Citi further\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nassumed, with the consent of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, that the final terms of the Merger\nAgreement would not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by Citi. Citi did not make and was not\nprovided with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Aerojet\nRocketdyne nor did Citi make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Citi was not\nrequested to, and it did not, solicit third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a part of\nAerojet Rocketdyne, nor was it requested to consider, and Citi\u2019s opinion did not address, the underlying business\ndecision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to effect the proposed Merger, the relative merits of the proposed Merger as\ncompared to any alternative business strategies that might have existed for Aerojet Rocketdyne or the effect of any\nother transaction in which Aerojet Rocketdyne might have engaged. Citi also expressed no view as to, and Citi\u2019s\nopinion did not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any\ncompensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the proposed Merger, or any class of such\npersons, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Citi\u2019s opinion was necessarily based upon information\navailable to Citi, and financial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing, as of the date of its\nopinion. The credit, financial and stock markets, the industries in which Aerojet Rocketdyne operates, and the\nsecurities of Aerojet Rocketdyne have experienced and may continue to experience volatility and Citi expressed no\nview or opinion as to any potential effects of such volatility on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the Merger.\nIn preparing its opinion, Citi performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those described\nbelow. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to\nthe most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the\nparticular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary\ndescription. Citi arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and factors assessed as a\nwhole, and it did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis for\npurposes of its opinion.\nIn its analyses, Citi considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions\nand other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nNo company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to Aerojet Rocketdyne or the\nMerger, and an evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical\u037e rather, the analyses involve complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect\nthe public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions reviewed or the results of\nany particular analysis.\nThe estimates used by Citi for purposes of its analyses and the valuation ranges resulting from any particular\nanalysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the\nvalue of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or\nsecurities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Citi\u2019s\nanalyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nCiti was not requested to, and it did not, recommend or determine the specific consideration payable in the Merger.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the proposed Merger was determined through negotiations\nbetween Aerojet Rocketdyne, on the one hand, and Lockheed Martin and its affiliates, on the other hand, and\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board\nof directors. Citi\u2019s opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors in\nits evaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors or the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne with respect to the proposed Merger, merger\nconsideration or any other aspect of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nFinancial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared for and reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors in connection with Citi\u2019s opinion, dated December 19, 2020, to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses\nperformed by, and underlying the opinion of, Citi, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent\nthe relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nby Citi. Certain financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to\nfully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the\ntables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables\nbelow without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and\nassumptions underlying the financial analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial\nanalyses. Future results may be different from those described, and such differences may be material. Approximate\nimplied equity value per share reference ranges derived from the financial analyses described below and other per\nshare ranges presented for reference purposes only were rounded to the nearest $0.25, except for data relating to\nintraday trading share prices. Except as otherwise noted, financial data utilized for Aerojet Rocketdyne in the financial\nanalyses described below were based on the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast as indicated\nand other information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne provided to or discussed with Citi and approved for\nCiti\u2019s use by Aerojet Rocketdyne and as further summarized in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe\nMerger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 73. For purposes of the financial\nanalyses described below, the term \u201cEBITDA,\u201d when used with respect to any company, other than Aerojet\nRocketdyne, generally refers to that company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\nexpenses\u037e the term \u201cadjusted EBITDA,\u201d when used with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne, generally refers to EBITDA\nexcluding EBITDA attributable to its real estate segment and income/(expense) related to re-measurement of net\nenvironmental remediation asset/liability.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nCiti conducted a discounted cash flow analysis of Aerojet Rocketdyne using the Base Case Forecast and the\nAdjusted Base Case Forecast. For each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts, Citi calculated a range of present\nvalues (as of September 30, 2020) of the estimated unlevered after-tax free cash flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was\nforecasted to generate under that set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year\nending December 31, 2020 through the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2029 (such cash flows referred to as the\n\u201cprojected cash flows\u201d). For purposes of this analysis, the projected cash flows provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nmanagement were adjusted with management\u2019s approval to exclude the impact of cash pension contributions and\nreimbursements, net environmental remediation cash flows and real estate cash flows (collectively, the \u201cadditional\ncash flow items\u201d). The additional cash flow items were excluded from the projected cash flows on the basis that they\nare significant items that Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management believes are non-perpetual. The impact of cash pension\ncontributions and reimbursements was reflected as a liability on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s balance sheet, and each of the\nnet environmental cash flows and real estate cash flows were reflected as assets. For purposes of this analysis, stock\nbased compensation was treated as a cash expense. Citi also calculated a range of estimated terminal values for\nAerojet Rocketdyne under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts, by applying an illustrative range of perpetuity\ngrowth rates of 2.0% to 3.0% to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated terminal year unlevered after-tax free cash flows\n(excluding the additional cash flow items) under that set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts. The illustrative range of\nperpetuity growth rates applied was selected by Citi based on its professional judgment and experience. The range of\nestimated terminal values for Aerojet Rocketdyne under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts was then\ndiscounted to present values (as of September 30, 2020) and added to the estimated present values of the projected\ncash flows under that set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts in order to derive ranges of implied adjusted firm values\nfor Aerojet Rocketdyne under that set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts.\nIn calculating the ranges of implied adjusted firm values for Aerojet Rocketdyne, Citi discounted the projected cash\nflows and estimated terminal values using discount rates ranging from 7.8% to 9.0%. Citi derived this range of\ndiscount rates based on a calculation of the weighted average cost of capital of Aerojet Rocketdyne it performed\nutilizing the capital asset pricing model with inputs that Citi determined were relevant based on publicly available data\nand Citi\u2019s professional judgment.\nFrom the range of implied adjusted firm values it derived under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts, Citi\nsubtracted Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s reported net debt and other as of September 30, 2020 (calculated as debt, excluding\nin-the-money convertible debt, plus the tax-effected net present value of net Cost Accounting Standards (\u201cCAS\u201d)\nreimbursements and cash pension contributions/other post-employment benefits (\u201cOPEB\u201d) payments, less cash,\ncash equivalents, a range of tax-effected net present values of real estate cash flows and reported net environmental\nasset/(liability)), and divided the results by the number of shares of Aerojet\n60\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRocketdyne common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury share method and\ntreating in-the-money convertible debt as converted to shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, based on\ninformation provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne management. The net present value of net CAS reimbursements and\ncash pension contributions/OPEB payments was calculated by discounting CAS reimbursements and cash pension\ncontributions/OPEB payments reflected in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts using, at the direction of Aerojet\nRocketdyne management, a 2.7% after tax cost of debt and 0% perpetuity growth rate. The range of tax-effected net\npresent values of real estate cash flows was calculated by discounting projected cash flows from real estate provided\nby Aerojet Rocketdyne management using a range of discount rates of 7.8% to 9.0%, which Citi derived from a\ncalculation of the weighted average cost of capital of Aerojet Rocketdyne. This analysis indicated the following\napproximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Aerojet Rocketdyne (rounded to the nearest $0.25)\nunder the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, as compared to $56.00 per share:\nImplied per Share \nEquity Value Reference\nRange\nBase Case Forecasts\n$53.00 - $71.00\nAdj. Base Case Forecasts\n$49.75 - $66.25\nPresent Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nCiti performed an analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common\nstock as of December 18, 2020 based on theoretical future prices calculated by Citi for the shares of Aerojet\nRocketdyne common stock under each of the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast. Citi derived\na range of theoretical future values per share for the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock as of December 31\nof each of 2021, 2022 and 2023 using each of the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast. For each\nset of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts, Citi derived this range of theoretical future values per share by (i) applying\nillustrative one year forward adjusted firm value to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined, and as calculated as described, in\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d)\nmultiples of 9.5x to 10.9x to estimates of the Adjusted EBITDA of Aerojet Rocketdyne for each of calendar years 2022,\n2023 and 2024, as reflected in that set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts, (ii) adjusting the resulting range of firm\nvalues to a range of equity values by subtracting Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated net debt and other for each period\nending as of December 31 (calculated as estimated debt, excluding in-the-money convertible debt, plus estimated tax\neffected unfunded pension/OPEB liability, less estimated cash, cash equivalents, mid-point estimate of tax effected\nnet present value of real estate cash flows and estimated net environmental asset/(liability)), and (iii) dividing the\nresulting range of equity values by the number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock outstanding on a\nfully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury share method and treating in-the-money convertible debt as\nconverted to shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, based on information provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\nmanagement. The firm value to Adjusted EBITDA multiples used by Citi were derived based on Citi\u2019s professional\njudgment and experience and taking into account historical firm value to Adjusted EBITDA multiples of Aerojet\nRocketdyne during the period from December 18, 2018 through December 18, 2020. By applying a discount rate of\n8.7%, reflecting a mid-point estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s cost of equity, Citi discounted to present value as of\nDecember 18, 2020 the theoretical future values per share it derived for Aerojet Rocketdyne under each set of Aerojet\nRocketdyne Forecasts, to yield under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts a range of illustrative present values\nper share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share\nequity value reference range for Aerojet Rocketdyne (rounded to the nearest $0.25) under each of the Base Case\nForecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, as compared to $56.00 per share:\nImplied per Share \nEquity Value Reference\nRange\nBase Case Forecasts\n$43.50 - $48.50\nAdj. Base Case Forecasts\n$42.00 - $46.75\n61\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Public Companies Analysis\nCiti reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne and the nine publicly\ntraded companies listed below whose operations, for the purposes of Citi\u2019s analysis and based on its experience and\nprofessional judgment, Citi considered generally relevant in evaluating those of Aerojet Rocketdyne, based on\nbusiness sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics (such companies collectively, the\n\u201cselected companies\u201d).\nFor the selected companies, Citi calculated and reviewed, among other information, firm values (calculated as fully\ndiluted market equity value, plus net debt, preferred equity and non-controlling interests, and less unconsolidated\ninvestments and non-operating assets, as applicable) as multiples of estimated calendar year 2021 EBITDA. All\ncalculations in this review were based on closing share prices on December 18, 2020 and, with respect to the selected\ncompanies, financial data (pro forma as applicable) were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019\nestimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Citi also calculated and reviewed the adjusted firm\nvalue of Aerojet Rocketdyne as a multiple of its estimated Adjusted EBITDA of Aerojet Rocketdyne for calendar year\n2021, based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019 estimates, as well as based on the Base Case Forecast\nand the Adjusted Base Case Forecast. The estimated calendar year 2021 EBITDA multiples observed for the selected\ncompanies and for Aerojet Rocketdyne were as follows:\nSelected Company\nFirm Value / 2021 EBITDA\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.\n34.7x\nAeroVironment, Inc.\n23.9x\nMercury Systems, Inc.\n22.7x\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.\n13.4x\nChemring Group PLC\n12.2x\nOHB SE\n12.1x\nElbit Systems Ltd.\n11.9x\nCACI International Inc.\n11.5x\nAvio S.p.A.\n9.4x\nMedian\n12.2x\nAerojet Rocketdyne (For Reference)\nFirm Value / 2021 Adj. EBITDA\nAerojet Rocketdyne (Wall Street Research)\n9.5x\nAerojet Rocketdyne (Base Case Forecasts)\n9.2x\nAerojet Rocketdyne (Adj. Base Case Forecast)\n9.4x\nBased on the multiples calculated and observed for the selected companies as described above and its professional\njudgment and experience, Citi identified and applied a selected illustrative range of firm value to calendar year 2021\nEBITDA multiples of 11.2x to 13.2x to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated calendar year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA, reflected\nin each of the Base Case Forecasts and the Adjusted Base Case Forecasts, to derive a range of implied adjusted firm\nvalues for Aerojet Rocketdyne under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts. Citi subtracted from the range of\nimplied adjusted firm values it derived under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nreported net debt and other as of September 30, 2020 (calculated as debt, excluding in-the-money convertible debt,\nplus tax effected reported unfunded pension/OPEB liability, less cash, cash equivalents, mid-point estimate of tax\neffected net present value of real estate cash flows and reported net environmental asset/(liability)) and divided the\nresults by the number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated\nusing the treasury share method and treating in-the-money convertible debt as converted to shares of Aerojet\nRocketdyne common stock, based on information provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne management. This analysis\nindicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Aerojet Rocketdyne (rounded\nto the nearest $0.25) under each of the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, as compared to\n$56.00 per share:\nImplied per Share \nEquity Value Reference\nRange\nBase Case Forecasts\n$50.00 - $57.75\nAdj. Base Case Forecasts\n$48.75 - $56.25\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, Citi reviewed certain financial data relating to the six transactions listed below\ninvolving target companies whose operations, for the purposes of Citi\u2019s analysis and based on its experience and\nprofessional judgment, Citi considered generally relevant in evaluating those of Aerojet Rocketdyne, based on\nbusiness sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics (such transactions collectively, the\n\u201cselected transactions\u201d).\nCiti calculated and reviewed, among other information, the implied firm value for the target company involved in each\ntransaction at the time of announcement (calculated based on (i) the aggregate consideration paid or to be paid in\nsuch transaction, or, if and as applicable, (ii) the fully diluted equity value implied by the per share purchase price in\nsuch transaction, plus net debt, preferred equity and non-controlling interests, and less unconsolidated investments\nand non-operating assets, as applicable) as a multiple of the applicable target company\u2019s publicly available EBITDA\n(or metric functionally equivalent thereto) for the last twelve-month period (\u201cLTM\u201d) prior to the announcement of the\napplicable transaction (such multiples, \u201cFirm Value / LTM EBITDA\u201d). The Firm Value / LTM EBITDA multiples\nobserved for the selected transactions were as follows:\nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nFirm Value / \nLTM EBITDA\n01/20/2020\nBAE Systems plc\nCollins Aerospace Military Global\nPositioning System business\n14.1x\u2007\u2007\n12/17/2019\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.\nDynetics, Inc.\n12.6x(1)\n07/25/2019\nAdvent International\nCobham plc\n13.2x\u2007\u2007\n10/14/2018\nHarris Corporation\nL3 Technologies, Inc.\n14.6x\u2007\u2007\n09/18/2017\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation\nOrbital ATK, Inc.\n14.4x\u2007\u2007\n09/4/ 2017\nUnited Technologies Corp.\nRockwell Collins, Inc.\n15.9x\u2007\u2007\n(1)\nRepresents an NTM multiple given lack of publicly reported LTM financials.\nBased on the multiples calculated and observed for the selected transactions and its professional judgment and\nexperience, Citi identified and applied a selected illustrative range of Firm Value / LTM EBITDA multiples of 12.6x to\n15.9x to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s LTM Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020, to\nderive a range of implied adjusted firm values for Aerojet Rocketdyne. Citi subtracted from the range of implied\nadjusted firm values it derived Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s reported net debt and other as of September 30, 2020 (calculated\nas described above under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger - Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. - Selected\nPublic Companies Analysis\u201d), and divided the results by the number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock\noutstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury share method and treating in-the-money\nconvertible debt as converted to shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, based on information provided by\nAerojet Rocketdyne management. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value\nreference range for Aerojet Rocketdyne (rounded to the nearest $0.25), as compared to $56.00 per share:\nImplied per Share \nEquity Value Reference Range\n$48.25 - $59.25\nOther Information\nCiti observed certain other information with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne that was not considered part of its\nfinancial analyses with respect to its opinion, but was noted for reference purposes only, including the following:\n\u2022\nhistorical intraday trading prices of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock for the 52-week period ended\nDecember 18, 2020, which indicated an overall low to high intraday trading share price range of $32.15 to\n$57.27 per share over the period\u037e and\n\u2022\npublicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019 one-year forward price targets, prepared and published in\nrelation to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, which indicated an overall low to high price target\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrange of $43.00 to $55.00 per share, implying a range of approximately $39.50 to $50.50 per share on a\ndiscounted basis (rounded to the nearest $0.25) when discounted one year at a discount rate of 8.7%,\nreflecting a mid-point estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s cost of equity.\n\u2022\nFor the years 2010 through 2020 (as of December 18, 2020), Citi calculated, using publicly available\ninformation, the median one-day unaffected stock price premia paid for acquisition transactions announced\nduring the period from 2010 through 2020 (as of December 18, 2020) involving 100% cash consideration\nwith a transaction value between $1 billion to $10 billion that Citi deemed appropriate in its professional\njudgment, which indicated a median one-day unaffected stock price premium of 30%. Based on the\nforegoing review and its professional judgment and experience, Citi applied a premia reference range of 20%\nto 40% to (i) the closing share price of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on December 18, 2020 of $42.04\nand (ii) the cash-adjusted share price of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on December 18, 2020 of $31.20\n(calculated as price less $10.84 cash per share based on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s reported cash balance as of\nSeptember 30, 2020). This analysis indicated an illustrative range of prices per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne\ncommon stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of $50.50 to $58.75, based on the closing share price of\nAerojet Rocketdyne common stock on December 18, 2020, and $48.25 to $54.50 (including $10.84 cash per\nshare) based on the cash-adjusted share price of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on December 18, 2020.\nMiscellaneous\nAerojet Rocketdyne has agreed to pay Citi for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee of $15\nmillion, $2 million of which became payable upon delivery of Citi\u2019s opinion to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors, and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon the consummation of the proposed Merger. In\naddition, Aerojet Rocketdyne agreed to reimburse Citi for certain expenses incurred by Citi in performing its services,\nand to indemnify Citi and related parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws,\narising out of Citi\u2019s engagement. Although Citi and its affiliates have not provided investment banking, commercial\nbanking or other similar financial services to Aerojet Rocketdyne during the two-year period prior to the date of Citi\u2019s\nopinion for which Citi and its affiliates received compensation, Citi and its affiliates in the future may provide such\nservices to Aerojet Rocketdyne and/or its affiliates, for which services Citi and its affiliates would expect to receive\ncompensation.\nAs Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s board of directors was aware, Citi and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are\nproviding and in the future may provide certain investment banking, commercial banking and other similar financial\nservices to Lockheed Martin unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which services Citi and such affiliates have\nreceived and expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two-year period prior to the\ndate of Citi\u2019s opinion, having acted as joint bookrunner for an offering of senior notes by Lockheed Martin in May\n2020. For the services described above for Lockheed Martin and its affiliates, Citi and its affiliates received, during\nthe two-year period prior to the date of Citi\u2019s opinion, aggregate fees of approximately $1.8 million.\nIn the ordinary course of Citi\u2019s business, Citi and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of Aerojet\nRocketdyne or Lockheed Martin for Citi\u2019s own account or for the account of Citi\u2019s customers and, accordingly, may at\nany time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, Citi and its affiliates (including Citigroup Inc.\nand its affiliates) may maintain relationships with Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin and their respective\naffiliates.\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s board of directors selected Citi as a financial advisor in connection with the Merger based on\nCiti\u2019s reputation, experience and familiarity with Aerojet Rocketdyne and its business. Citi is an internationally\nrecognized investment banking firm that regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities in\nconnection with mergers and acquisitions and other purposes.\nOpinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.",

As part\nof this engagement, Aerojet Rocketdyne requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. On\nDecember 19, 2020, at a meeting of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors held to evaluate the proposed Merger,\nEvercore rendered to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors its oral opinion, which was\n64TABLE OF CONTENTS\nsubsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of December 19, 2020 and based upon and subject to the\nassumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore\u2019s opinion, the merger consideration of\n$56.00 per share minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend, to be received by\nholders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nholders. Evercore\u2019s written opinion noted that shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock owned by Lockheed\nMartin or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, shares held by Aerojet Rocketdyne or any of its\nsubsidiaries, and dissenting shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) would not be converted into the right to\nreceive the merger consideration.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated December 19, 2020, which sets forth, among other things, the\nprocedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of\nreview undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated\nherein by reference. Aerojet Rocketdyne encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety.\nEvercore\u2019s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board\nof directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not\nconstitute a recommendation to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the\nMerger, including as to how any holder of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock should vote or act in respect\nof the Merger. Evercore\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business\nor financial strategies that might be available to Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor does it address the underlying business\ndecision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to engage in the Merger.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Evercore, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne that it\ndeemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates and reviewed certain\nadditional business and financial information made available to Evercore by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne prepared and furnished to\nEvercore by management of Aerojet Rocketdyne, as approved for Evercore\u2019s use by Aerojet Rocketdyne,\nincluding the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast (collectively, the \u201cAerojet\nRocketdyne Forecasts\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\ndiscussed with management of Aerojet Rocketdyne their assessment of the past and current operations of\nAerojet Rocketdyne, the current financial condition and prospects of Aerojet Rocketdyne, and the Aerojet\nRocketdyne Forecasts, including their views on the alternative business scenarios underlying the Base\nCase Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, respectively\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne and its stock market trading multiples with\nthose of certain other publicly traded companies that it deemed relevant\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne and the valuation multiples relating to the\nMerger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that it deemed\nrelevant\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated December 17, 2020, of the Merger Agreement\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nperformed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that it deemed\nappropriate.\nSet forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nboard of directors on December 19, 2020 in connection with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however,\ndoes not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses\ndescribed and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by\nEvercore. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market\ndata, is based on market data that existed on or before December 18, 2020 (the last full trading date prior to the\nrendering of Evercore\u2019s opinion), and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions, industry sector performance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of\nits opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Aerojet Rocketdyne. The estimates contained in Evercore\u2019s\nanalyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or\nless favorable than those suggested by Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating\nto the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which\ncompanies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived\nfrom, Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nFor purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the\nfinancial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to,\ndiscussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent verification of such information (and Evercore has\nnot assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and Evercore further\nrelied upon the assurances of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that they were not aware of any facts or\ncircumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Base Case Forecast\nand the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, respectively, Evercore assumed with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s consent that they\nwere reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of\nmanagement of Aerojet Rocketdyne as to the future financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne in the alternative\nbusiness scenarios underlying the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, respectively. Evercore\nexpressed no view as to the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast or the alternative business\nscenarios or other assumptions on which they were based.\nFor purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the final\nexecuted agreement would not differ from the draft of the Merger Agreement reviewed by Evercore, that the\nrepresentations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party\nwill perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that\nall conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. Evercore\nfurther assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals\nor releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or\ncondition that would have an adverse effect on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the consummation of the Merger or reduce\nthe contemplated benefits to the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock of the Merger. The credit, financial\nand stock markets had been experiencing unusual volatility and Evercore expressed no opinion or view as to any\npotential effects of such volatility on the parties or the Merger. In addition, Evercore relied, without independent\nverification, on the assessments of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne as to (i) the validity of, and risks\nassociated with, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s intellectual property, technology, products and services, and (ii) the\nmarketability, commercial viability and market adoption of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s current and future products and\nservices.\nEvercore did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Aerojet Rocketdyne and did not make\nor assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including\nany contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor was Evercore\nfurnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor has Evercore evaluated the solvency or fair value of Aerojet\nRocketdyne under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore\u2019s opinion\nis necessarily based upon information made available to Evercore as of the date of its opinion and financial,\neconomic, market and other conditions as they existed and as could be evaluated on the date of its opinion. It is\nunderstood that subsequent developments may affect Evercore\u2019s opinion and that Evercore does not have any\nobligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.\nEvercore was not asked to pass upon, and Evercore expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne common\nstock. Evercore did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, the fairness of the proposed\ntransaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of\nsecurities, creditors or other constituencies of Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of\nany compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Aerojet Rocketdyne, or any\nclass of such persons, whether relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Evercore was not asked to, nor did\nEvercore express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without limitation, the structure or form of the Merger, or\nany term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or\namended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Evercore\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of the\nMerger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor does\nit address the underlying business decision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to engage in the Merger. In arriving at its opinion,\nEvercore was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any third party with respect to the acquisition\nof any or all of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock or any business combination or other extraordinary transaction\ninvolving Aerojet Rocketdyne. Evercore\u2019s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of\nAerojet Rocketdyne common stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore was not expressing any\nopinion as to the prices at which shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock will trade at any time, as to the\npotential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the Merger or as to\nthe impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of Aerojet Rocketdyne or the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to\npay its obligations when they come due. Evercore is not a legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and has assumed\nthe accuracy and completeness of assessments by Aerojet Rocketdyne and its advisors with respect to legal,\nregulatory, accounting and tax matters.\nThe following summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order\nto fully understand the analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables\nare not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses.\nConsidering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses,\nincluding the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete\nview of such analyses.\nSummary of Evercore\u2019s Financial Analyses\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nEvercore performed discounted cash flow analyses of Aerojet Rocketdyne to calculate the estimated present value of\nthe standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was forecasted to generate during\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s fiscal years 2021 through 2029 based on each of the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted\nBase Case Forecast. For purposes of this analysis, the projected cash flows provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nmanagement were adjusted with management\u2019s approval to exclude the impact of cash pension contributions and\nreimbursements, net environmental remediation cash flows and real estate cash flows (collectively, the \u201cadditional\ncash flow items\u201d). The additional cash flow items were excluded from the projected cash flows on the basis that they\nare significant items that Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management believes are non-perpetual. The impact of cash pension\ncontributions and reimbursements was reflected as a liability on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s balance sheet, and each of the\nnet environmental cash flows and real estate cash flows were reflected as assets. Evercore calculated terminal values\nfor Aerojet Rocketdyne by applying perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0%, which range was selected based on\nEvercore\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash\nflows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was forecasted to generate based on the Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts. The cash\nflows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2020 using discount\nrates ranging from 7.50% to 8.75%, which were based on an estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s weighted average cost\nof capital and the mid-year cash flow discounting convention. Based on this range of implied enterprise values,\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s total debt (excluding convertible notes), cash and marketable securities (excluding restricted\ncash and cash used to repurchase shares since September 30, 2020 per Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management) and net\nenvironmental asset position resulting from government and other reimbursements that Aerojet Rocketdyne\nmanagement projects will more than fully offset Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s payments related to its environmental\nremediation liabilities as of September 30, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s present value of forecast cash contributions to\nfund pension liabilities, net of federal government reimbursement for certain pension expenses, for fiscal years 2021\nthrough 2029, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s average estimated present value of real estate and the number of fully diluted\nshares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, in each case as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management, this\nanalysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to the\nnearest $0.25 of $52.00 to $71.00 in the case of the Base Case Forecast and a range of implied equity values per share\nof Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $48.75 to $66.25 in the case of the Adjusted\nBase Case Forecast, each as compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne\ncommon stock minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Public Company Trading Analysis\nEvercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of Aerojet Rocketdyne to corresponding financial\nmultiples and ratios for the following selected publicly traded companies in the defense industry (the \u201cselected\ncompanies\u201d) which Evercore deemed most relevant to consider in relation to Aerojet Rocketdyne, based on its\nprofessional judgment and experience, because they are public companies with operations that, for purposes of its\nanalysis, Evercore considered similar to the operations of Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nFor each of the selected companies, Evercore calculated, based on closing share prices as of December 18, 2020 (i)\nenterprise value (defined as equity market capitalization plus total debt, plus after-tax unfunded pension and other\npost-employment benefits (\u201cOPEB\u201d) obligations as of December 31, 2019, plus minority interest, less cash and cash\nequivalents and investments in unconsolidated affiliates, all as of latest available publicly filed balance sheets unless\notherwise noted) as a multiple of estimated 2021 and 2022 Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,\u201d provided that when used\nwith respect to companies other than Aerojet Rocketdyne, no adjustments attributable to the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nreal estate segment and income/(expense) related to re-measurement of net environmental remediation liability are\nincluded in such definition), which we refer to as \u201c2021E Adjusted EBITDA\u201d and \u201c2022E Adjusted EBITDA,\u201d\nrespectively, and (ii) closing share prices as a multiple of estimated 2021 and 2022 earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d), which\nwe refer to as \u201c2021E EPS\u201d and \u201c2022E EPS,\u201d respectively. Estimated financial data of the selected companies (pro\nforma as applicable) were based on publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThis analysis indicated the following: \nEV/2021E\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nEV/2022E\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nPrice/2021E\nEPS\nPrice/2022E\nEPS\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation\n11.7x\n10.8x\n13.2x\n11.9x\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.\n12.9x\n11.1x\n16.6x\n13.0x\nL3Harris Technologies, Inc.\n12.0x\n11.4x\n14.3x\n12.7x\nLockheed Martin Corporation\n11.3x\n10.7x\n13.6x\n12.7x\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation\n12.7x\n11.9x\n12.6x\n11.4x\nRaytheon Technologies Corporation\n14.0x\n11.2x\n20.3x\n15.0x\nThales SA\n9.0x\n8.0x\n12.7x\n10.8x\nMedian\n12.0x\n11.1x\n13.6x\n12.7x\nBase Case Forecast\nBased on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and experience,\nEvercore selected a reference range of: enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 10.0x - 12.0x and applied this\nrange of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA based on the Base Case\nForecast, enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 9.0x - 11.0x and applied this range of multiples to Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA based on the Base Case Forecast\u037e price/EPS multiples of\n14.0x - 17.0x and applied this range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2021 EPS (excluding\ncash) based on the Base Case Forecast, and price/EPS multiples of 13.0x - 16.0x and applied this range of multiples to\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2022 EPS (excluding cash) based on the Base Case Forecast. \u201cEPS\n(excluding cash)\u201d reflects Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s forecast net income and average fully diluted share count, excluding\nestimated post-tax income per average fully diluted share attributable to interest earned on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nbalance of cash and marketable securities. Evercore made this adjustment to EPS in order to be able to more\naccurately infer a range of valuation multiples for Aerojet Rocketdyne based on the trading valuations of its peers,\nfor which cash makes up a materially lower portion of total market capitalization. Based on these ranges of implied\nenterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s total debt (excluding convertible notes), cash and marketable securities\n(excluding restricted cash) and net environmental asset position as of September 30, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nafter-tax unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities as of December 31, 2019, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s average estimated\npresent value of real estate and the number of fully diluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, in each case\nas provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share\nof Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $45.25 to $53.25, $41.75 to $50.00, $40.50 to\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n$47.00, and $43.75 to $51.25, respectively, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet\nRocketdyne common stock minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.\nAdjusted Base Case Forecast\nBased on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and experience,\nEvercore selected a reference range of: enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 10.0x - 12.0x and applied this\nrange of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA based on the Adjusted Base\nCase Forecast, enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 9.0x - 11.0x and applied this range of multiples to\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA based on the Adjusted Base Case Forecast\u037e\nprice/EPS multiples of 14.0x - 17.0x and applied this range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated fiscal year\n2021 EPS (excluding cash) based on the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, and price/EPS multiples of 13.0x - 16.0x and\napplied this range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2022 EPS (excluding cash) based on the\nAdjusted Base Case Forecast. Based on these ranges of implied enterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s total debt\n(excluding convertible notes), cash and marketable securities (excluding restricted cash) and net environmental asset\nposition as of September 30, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities as of\nDecember 31, 2019, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s average estimated present value of real estate and the number of fully\ndiluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, in each case as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s\nmanagement, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock\nrounded to the nearest $0.25 of $44.00 to $51.75, $40.25 to $48.00, $39.50 to $45.75, and $42.25 to $49.50, respectively,\ncompared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock minus, to the extent\npaid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.\nAlthough none of the selected companies are directly comparable to Aerojet Rocketdyne, Evercore selected these\ncompanies because they are publicly traded defense companies that Evercore, in its professional judgment and\nexperience, considered generally relevant to Aerojet Rocketdyne for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating\nthe selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and\nmarket conditions affecting the selected companies and other matters, as well as differences in the selected\ncompanies\u2019 financial, business and operating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this\nanalysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding\nmany factors that could affect the relative values of the selected companies and the multiples derived from the\nselected companies. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful\nmethod of using the data of the selected companies.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nEvercore reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information related to the following selected transactions\ninvolving target companies in the defense and aerospace industries announced since 2015 (the \u201cselected\ntransactions\u201d). For each selected transaction, Evercore calculated the implied enterprise value (defined as the target\ncompany\u2019s implied equity value based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt, plus\nminority interest and after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities (post-Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Update 2017-07 effective date, if relevant), less cash and cash equivalents and net of acquired\ntax benefits, if relevant) as a multiple of last twelve-month (LTM) Adjusted EBITDA for the target company at the\ntime of the announcement of the applicable transaction, which we refer to as \u201cLTM Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d Estimated\nfinancial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement\nof the relevant transaction.

Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is\nnot in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the selected transactions.\nOther Factors\nEvercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to\nits opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLast 52-Week Trading Range\nEvercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock during the twelve-\nmonth period ended December 18, 2020, noting that the low and high closing prices during such period ranged\nfrom $32.42 to $55.96 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, respectively.\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets\nEvercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common\nstock prepared and published by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of December 18, 2020,\nthe last full trading day prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors. These price targets reflect analysts\u2019 estimates of the future public market trading price of the shares of\nAerojet Rocketdyne common stock at the time the price target was published. As of December 18, 2020, the\nrange of selected equity research analyst price targets per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock was\n$43.00 to $55.00. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily\nreflect current market trading prices for the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock and these target prices\nand the analysts\u2019 earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including\nfactors affecting the financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne and future general industry and market\nconditions.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price\nEvercore performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per share of Aerojet\nRocketdyne common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical\nfuture value of a company\u2019s equity as a function of that company\u2019s EPS.\nIn calculating the implied present value of the future price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock,\nEvercore first calculated a range of implied future prices per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on\nDecember 31, 2023 by multiplying Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s estimated calendar year 2024 EPS based on each of the\nBase Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast by a range of illustrative price-to-earnings ratios of\n20.6x to 22.6x. Evercore then discounted the implied share prices back to December 31, 2020 using discount rates\nranging from 8.25% to 9.25%, which were based on an estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s cost of equity. This\nanalysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to\nthe nearest $0.25 of $48.75 to $54.75 and $46.50 to $52.50 based on the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted\nBase Case Forecast, respectively, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet\nRocketdyne common stock minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.\nPremiums Paid Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, Evercore reviewed 39 all-cash and 50 total transactions and announced\nbids for control of U.S. public targets by strategic acquirors with an aggregate transaction value between $2\nbillion and $6 billion announced since January 1, 2015 (excluding financial, REIT, master limited partnership and\npharmaceutical targets, mergers of equals, acquisitions by financial sponsors and transactions between related\nparties). Using publicly available information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which\nthe per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each such transaction exceeded the closing market\nprices per share of the target companies one day and four weeks prior to announcement of each transaction.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\n1 Day Prior\n(39 All-Cash \nTransactions)\n1 Day Prior\n(50 Total \nTransactions)\n4 Weeks\nPrior\n(39 All-Cash \nTransactions)\n4 Weeks\nPrior\n(50 Total \nTransactions)\n25th Percentile\n18.7%\n20.6%\n28.6%\n27.6%\nMedian\n29.7%\n31.6%\n38.8%\n40.5%\nMean\n34.5%\n34.4%\n41.1%\n42.2%\n75th Percentile\n46.7%\n45.9%\n46.1%\n48.3%\n71\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied (i) a\npremium range of 20% to 45% to $31.26, representing the closing market price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne\ncommon stock on December 18, 2020 minus the $10.78 amount of cash and marketable securities (excluding\nrestricted cash) per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, and (ii) a premium range of 25% to 45% to $31.26, representing the closing market price per\nshare of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on December 18, 2020 minus the $10.78 amount of cash and\nmarketable securities (excluding restricted cash) per share on Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2020. The resulting products were added to $10.78 of cash and marketable securities (excluding\nrestricted cash) per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. This analysis indicated a range of implied\nequity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $48.25 to $56.00\nand $49.75 to $56.00 based on the one-day prior and four-weeks prior premia, respectively, compared to the\nmerger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock minus, to the extent paid, the\namount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the\nanalyses or data presented by Evercore to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors. In connection with the review\nof the Merger by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s board of directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative\nanalyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not\nnecessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the\nsummary described above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Evercore\u2019s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of\nall the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor\nconsidered by it for purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its\nprofessional judgment and experience after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have\ngiven various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed\nvarious assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting\nfrom any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of\nEvercore with respect to the actual value of the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. Rounding may result in\ntotal sums set forth in this section not equaling the total of the figures shown.\nEvercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of\ndirectors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of shares of\nAerojet Rocketdyne common stock. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the\nprices at which the business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those\nsuggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore\u2019s analyses are\ninherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially\ndifferent from those forecasted in such estimates.\nEvercore\u2019s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The\nissuance of Evercore\u2019s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.\nEvercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors or\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate\nconsideration in the Merger for the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of Evercore\u2019s engagement letter with Aerojet Rocketdyne, Aerojet Rocketdyne has agreed to\npay Evercore a fee for its services in the amount of approximately $15 million, of which $1 million was paid upon\ndelivery of Evercore\u2019s opinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the consummation of the\nMerger. Aerojet Rocketdyne has also agreed to reimburse Evercore for certain expenses and to indemnify Evercore\nagainst certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.\nDuring the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to\nprovide financial advisory or other services to Aerojet Rocketdyne and Evercore has not received any compensation\nfrom Aerojet Rocketdyne during such period. In addition, during the two-year period prior to the\n72\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndate of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services\nto Lockheed Martin and Evercore has not received any compensation from Lockheed Martin during such period.\nEvercore may provide financial advisory or other services to Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin in the future,\nand in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.\nEvercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of\ncustomers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity,\nplacement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or otherwise,\nEvercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which any of them\nmay have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or\notherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior\nloans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne or its affiliates,\nLockheed Martin or its affiliates or persons that are competitors, customers or suppliers of Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nAerojet Rocketdyne engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore\u2019s qualifications, experience\nand reputation. Evercore is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly provides fairness\nopinions to its clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and valuations for corporate\nand other purposes.\nCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information",

            "text": "Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nAlthough Aerojet Rocketdyne may periodically issue limited guidance to investors concerning its expected financial\nperformance, Aerojet Rocketdyne does not as a matter of course publicly disclose long-term financial projections due\nto, among other things, the inherent uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and\nestimates, particularly in the aerospace and defense industry. However, in connection with the proposed Merger,\nAerojet Rocketdyne management prepared certain non-public, unaudited financial projections regarding Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s future results of operations for fiscal years ending 2020 through 2029.\nOne set of financial projections (referred to herein as the \u201cBase Case Forecast\u201d) was based upon and reflected,\namong other things, an assumption that the NASA Space Launch System (\u201cSLS\u201d) manifest would ramp up from\nabout one launch per year to two launches per year beginning in 2028. The Base Case Forecast was provided to and\nits assumptions were discussed with Lockheed Martin, and was also provided to, and reviewed with, the Aerojet\nRocketdyne board of directors as well as Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s financial advisors, Citi and Evercore, for use, with the\napproval of Aerojet Rocketdyne, in connection with Citi\u2019s and Evercore\u2019s respective financial analyses and opinions\ndescribed above under the sections in this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Opinion of Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc.\u201d and \u201cThe Merger - Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.,\u201d respectively. Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed\nMartin also discussed, among other things, the possibility that the NASA SLS manifest would remain at about one\nlaunch per year (rather than ramping up to two launches per year beginning in 2028, as contemplated by the Base\nCase Forecast).\nAnother set of more conservative financial projections (referred to herein as the \u201cAdjusted Base Case Forecast\u201d) was\nbased upon and reflected, among other things, the assumption that the NASA SLS manifest would remain at about\none launch per year. The Adjusted Base Case Forecast was provided to, and reviewed with, the Aerojet Rocketdyne\nboard of directors as well as Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s financial advisors, Citi and Evercore, for use, with the approval of\nAerojet Rocketdyne, in connection with Citi\u2019s and Evercore\u2019s respective financial analyses and opinions described\nabove under the sections in this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Opinion of Citigroup Global Market Inc.\u201d\nand \u201cThe Merger - Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.,\u201d respectively.\nThe Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast are referred to herein collectively as the \u201cAerojet\nRocketdyne Forecasts.\u201d\nBase Case Forecast. Aerojet Rocketdyne management prepared the Base Case Forecast as summarized below:\n\u2022\nFor years 2020 through 2024 in the Base Case Forecast, Aerojet Rocketdyne management used Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s then-current (as of September 2020) 5-year strategic growth plan, which was based upon and\nreflected an assumption that the NASA SLS manifest would ramp up from about one launch per year to two\nlaunches per year beginning in 2028. Years 2020 through 2024 in the Base Case Forecast reflected numerous\nother Aerojet Rocketdyne management assumptions consistent with such 5-year\n73TABLE OF CONTENTS\nstrategic growth plan, including, among other things, (1) generation of future revenues in Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s aerospace and defense business based in part on its existing firm and follow-on backlog and\nassumptions of new business with, in Aerojet Rocketdyne management\u2019s view, a reasonable probability of\nwinning, (2) aerospace and defense EBITDA margins ranging from 15.0% to 15.8%, (3) depreciation and\namortization ranging from 2% to 3% of revenue, (4) capital expenditures ranging from 2% to 3% of revenue,\nand (5) an applicable tax rate of 26%.\n\u2022\nFor years 2025 through 2029 in the Base Case Forecast, Aerojet Rocketdyne management extrapolated, from\nthe last year of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s strategic growth plan, results for those next five years, with a\ncontinuing assumption that the NASA SLS manifest would ramp up from about one launch per year to two\nlaunches per year beginning in 2028. Years 2025 through 2029 in the Base Case Forecast also reflected\nnumerous other Aerojet Rocketdyne management assumptions, including, among other things, (1)\ngeneration of future revenues in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s aerospace and defense business based in part on its\nexisting firm and follow-on backlog and assumptions of new business with, in Aerojet Rocketdyne\nmanagement\u2019s view, a reasonable probability of winning, (2) aerospace and defense EBITDA margin growth\nranging from 16.0% to 16.5%, (3) depreciation and amortization equal to 3% of revenue, (4) capital\nexpenditures equal to 2% of revenue, and (5) an applicable tax rate of 26%.\nAdjusted Base Case Forecast. Aerojet Rocketdyne management prepared the Adjusted Base Case Forecast using\nsimilar assumptions as the Base Case Forecast, except that (1) the Adjusted Base Case Forecast was based upon and\nreflected an assumption that the NASA SLS manifest would remain at about one launch per year (rather than ramping\nup to two launches per year beginning in 2028) and (2) Aerojet Rocketdyne management decremented revenue and\nassociated profit and cash flow in amounts that, in its judgment, were appropriate to reflect such assumed reduced\nNASA SLS launch manifest.\nRisk Adjusted Case Analysis. In addition, in November 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne management provided to the\nAerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, Citi and Evercore a downside risk-based sensitivity analysis in respect of the\nAdjusted Base Case Forecast (the \u201cRisk Adjusted Case Analysis\u201d) taking into account Aerojet Rocketdyne\nmanagement\u2019s evolving and expanding view that there was growing uncertainty in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s space\nexploration business prospects. The Risk Adjusted Case Analysis was based on similar assumptions as the Adjusted\nBase Case Forecast, except that (1) the Risk Adjusted Case Analysis further assumed that NASA\u2019s schedule for\nlanding a human presence on the moon could potentially be delayed and that space exploration-related new business\nmight not be funded or won at the same rate assumed in the Adjusted Base Case Forecast and (2) Aerojet\nRocketdyne management further decremented revenue and associated profit and cash flow in amounts that, in its\njudgment, were appropriate to reflect such assumed slippage in the moon landing schedule and reduced space\nexploration-related new business.\nManagement Presentation Forecast. In May 2020 Aerojet Rocketdyne management had also provided to Lockheed\nMartin and Citi (and in October 2020 Aerojet Rocketdyne management provided to Evercore) certain non-public,\nunaudited financial projections regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2020 through\n2029 (the \u201cManagement Presentation Forecast\u201d), which projections were subsequently superseded by the Base Case\nForecast in September 2020. The Management Presentation Forecast had been based on substantially similar\nassumptions as the Base Case Forecast, except that the Base Case Forecast in September 2020 incorporated emerging\nopportunities that added approximately $500 million more revenue, and associated profit and cash flow, over the 10-\nyear period than the Management Presentation Forecast had assumed.\nThe Risk Adjusted Case Analysis and the Management Presentation Forecast were neither approved by Aerojet\nRocketdyne for use, nor used, by Citi or Evercore in connection with Citi\u2019s and Evercore\u2019s respective financial\nanalyses and opinions described above under the sections in this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - Opinion\nof Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\u201d and \u201cThe Merger - Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.,\u201d respectively.\nWe sometimes refer to the Base Case Forecast, the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, the Risk Adjusted Case Analysis\nand the Management Presentation Forecast collectively as the \u201cManagement Projections.\u201d\nThe below summary of the Management Projections is included in this proxy statement for the purpose of providing\nstockholders certain nonpublic information that was furnished to certain persons and parties (in each case, as and to\nthe extent described in this section of the proxy statement captioned\n74\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d) in connection with evaluating the Merger and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and such information may not be appropriate for\nother purposes, and it is not included to influence the voting decision of any stockholder on the Merger Proposal or\nany of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to influence any stockholder to make any\ninvestment decision with respect to the Merger. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward\npublic disclosure, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections, the use of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures or forward-looking statements, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for the preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. None of Aerojet Rocketdyne,\nLockheed Martin, Citi, Evercore or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives\nconsidered, or now consider, the inclusion of the Management Projections to be regarded as an indication that the\nManagement Projections are predictive of actual future events, actual future results or performance of Aerojet\nRocketdyne, or actual future results or performance of Lockheed Martin following its acquisition of Aerojet\nRocketdyne, and such information should not be relied upon as such. Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned\nnot to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.\nWhile presented here with numeric specificity, the Management Projections were based on many variables and\nassumptions (including assumptions related to industry performance and general business, economic, market and\nfinancial conditions and additional matters specific to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business) that are inherently subjective\nand uncertain, continually evolving and beyond the control of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s management. Important factors\nthat may affect actual results and cause this unaudited prospective financial information not to be achieved include,\nbut are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s business (including its ability to\nachieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business and\neconomic conditions, changes in laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, tax laws and regulations),\nchanges in government priorities and other factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 16. The Management Projections also reflect numerous variables,\nexpectations and assumptions available at the time they were prepared as to certain business decisions that are\nsubject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Management\nProjections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized.\nStockholders are urged to review the most recent SEC filings of Aerojet Rocketdyne for a description of the reported\nresults of operations and financial condition of Aerojet Rocketdyne, including in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2019, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020.\nNone of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Citi, Evercore or their respective officers, directors, affiliates,\nadvisors or other representatives can provide you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from this\nunaudited prospective financial information.\nNEITHER AEROJET ROCKETDYNE, LOCKHEED MARTIN, NOR ANY OTHER PARTY UNDERTAKES ANY\nOBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE OR RECONCILE THE MANAGEMENT PROJECTIONS\nTO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE THE MANAGEMENT PROJECTIONS WERE\nGENERATED OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR\nALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH INFORMATION ARE SHOWN TO BE IN ERROR. SINCE\nTHE MANAGEMENT PROJECTIONS COVER MULTIPLE YEARS, SUCH INFORMATION BY ITS NATURE\nBECOMES MORE LIKELY TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE\nYEAR.\nAerojet Rocketdyne has not made and makes no representation to Lockheed Martin or any Aerojet Rocketdyne\nstockholder or other stakeholder or any other party, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the\nManagement Projections or regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s actual performance compared to the Management\nProjections or that the projected results will be achieved. The inclusion of this unaudited prospective financial\ninformation in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Aerojet Rocketdyne that\nthe information is material. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in this unaudited\nprospective financial information, Aerojet Rocketdyne urges all of its stockholders not to place undue reliance, if any,\non such information and to review Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a description of Aerojet\nRocketdyne\u2019s reported financial results and condition.\n75\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNeither Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled,\nexamined or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor\nhave they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and they\nassume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information.

Under the Drake Employment Agreement, if Ms. Drake\u2019s employment is terminated\nby us without \u201ccause\u201d (including due to a death or disability) or by Ms. Drake for \u201cgood reason\u201d within the period\ncommencing six months prior to (or, if earlier, following the signing of a definitive agreement that, if consummated,\nwould result in a change in control) and ending 24 months following a \u201cchange in control,\u201d then Ms. Drake shall be\nentitled to the following payments and benefits: (i) accrued obligations\u037e (ii) annual target bonus for the pro-rated\nportion of the fiscal year prior to the change in control, paid in a lump sum\u037e (iii) a severance payment equal to three\ntimes the sum of (y) Ms. Drake\u2019s base salary and (z) annual target bonus, paid in a lump sum\u037e (iv) to the extent\nunvested at the time of Ms. Drake\u2019s termination of employment, immediate full vesting of all of Ms. Drake\u2019s equity\nawards (at the maximum level of performance, if applicable)\u037e (v) the opportunity to continue to participate in our life\ninsurance policy in which she is enrolled before the date of termination at an amount of one times base salary for a\nperiod of 12 months following the date of termination\u037e (vi) provided Ms. Drake timely elects and is eligible for COBRA\ncoverage, payment by us of the premiums associated with 24 months of Ms. Drake\u2019s continued participation, without\nany required contributions from Ms. Drake (but subject to all other plan terms, including co-payments and\ndeductibles) in the health benefit plans in which Ms. Drake is enrolled prior to the date of termination\u037e (vii) the\nopportunity to continue to participate in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Executive Physical Program for a period of 24\nmonths following termination and (viii) outplacement services provided by the company-designated outplacement\nfirm for a period of 18 months starting no later than ninety (90) days from Ms. Drake\u2019s date of termination, with a\nmaximum value of $25,000 (in each case, as such terms are defined in the Drake Employment Agreement). Receipt of\nsuch compensation and benefits is contingent on Ms. Drake\u2019s timely execution of a release in the form attached to\nthe Drake Employment Agreement.\nWe also maintain an executive change in control severance policy, which was amended on March 5, 2020 (the \u201cCIC\nPolicy\u201d). The CIC Policy provides all of our executive officers, other than Ms. Drake and Mr. Lichtenstein, with\ncompensation and benefits upon a termination of their employment by us without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for\n\u201cgood reason\u201d (including due to an executive\u2019s death or \u201cdisability\u201d) within the six-month period prior to a \u201cchange\nin control\u201d (or, if earlier, following the signing of a definitive agreement that, if consummated, would result in a change\nin control) through the 24-month period following a \u201cchange in control\u201d (in each case, as such terms are defined in\nthe CIC policy). In the event of an applicable termination of employment, the executive officer shall be entitled to the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\nlump sum payment equal to two times the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary\u037e\n\u2022\nprorated portion of incentive compensation under our short-term incentive plan (\u201cSTIP\u201d) for the\nperformance year in which the \u201ctermination date\u201d (as defined in the CIC Policy) occurs (prorated based on\nlength of employment during such performance year), at the greater of target and actual performance\u037e\n83\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nfull STIP payment for the year prior to the termination date, if unpaid as of the termination date, based upon\nactual performance\u037e\n\u2022\nlump sum payment equal to two times the target incentive compensation such executive officer could have\nreceived under the STIP for the entire year in which the termination date occurs\u037e\n\u2022\ncontinued participation in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Executive Physical Program for a period of 24 months\nfollowing termination\u037e\n\u2022\npayment of COBRA benefit premiums until the earlier of the 24-month anniversary of the termination date or\nwhen eligible for health insurance coverage through another employer\u037e\n\u2022\nto the extent unvested, immediate full vesting of all of the executive officer\u2019s equity awards (at the maximum\nlevel of performance, if applicable)\u037e and\n\u2022\noutplacement services for a period of 12 months starting no later than 90 days from date of termination,\nwith a maximum value of $15,000.\nReceipt of compensation and benefits under the CIC Policy is contingent on the executive officer\u2019s timely execution\nof a release in a form we prescribe.\nThe Merger will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of each of these arrangements. These arrangements do\nnot include a \u201cgross-up\u201d of any golden parachute excise tax imposed on the executive officer pursuant to Section\n4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, payments would be reduced to an amount equal to the greatest dollar\namount that would not subject the executive officer to the imposition of the excise tax, unless the executive officer\nwould be placed in a better after-tax position receiving all payments and paying the excise tax.\nThe estimated aggregate amount that would be payable to our executive officers who are not named executive\nofficers under the CIC Policy upon the effective time of the Merger is $11,209,986.\nPayments under Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors\nCertain of our non-employee directors and Mr. Lichtenstein participate in the Company\u2019s Deferred Compensation\nPlan for Directors. In connection with the Merger, accrued account balances under such plan will become immediately\npayable in a cash lump sum.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or\notherwise relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger. Please see the previous portions of this section for further information regarding this\ncompensation.\nThe amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely for\npurposes of this table, that the Merger is consummated on January 15, 2021, and that the employment of each of the\nnamed executive officers were subject to an involuntary termination without cause on January 15, 2021. The amounts\nindicated in the table below also assume that the amount payable in respect of outstanding and unvested equity\nawards will be $56.00 per share. Our executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation,\ntax reimbursement or other benefits in connection with the Merger.\n84\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSome of the amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the Merger. In\naddition to the assumptions regarding the consummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment,\nthese estimates are based on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table\nbelow. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger\nmay differ from the amounts set forth below.\nName(1)\nCash($)(2)\nEquity Award\nVesting \n($)(3)\nPerquisites\n/ \nbenefits \n($)(4)\nTotal \nPayments \n($)\nWarren G.

For the other named executive officers, the amounts reflect estimated double-trigger\npayments of the lump-sum cash severance that would be provided to the named executive officer under the terms of the Drake\nEmployment Agreement or the CIC Policy, as applicable, if the named executive officer were to experience a covered\ntermination for the purposes of the Drake Employment Agreement or the CIC Policy, as applicable, on the closing date of the\nmerger, as described above in \u201cThe Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger -\nPayments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control,\u201d calculated as (i) a pro-rated annual bonus for 2021, assuming target\nperformance and (ii) three times, in the case of Ms. Drake, or two times, in the case of Mr. Boehle and Mr. Schumacher, base\nsalary plus target short-term incentive compensation. The amounts assume that the annual bonus for 2020 was earned and paid\nprior to the closing date of the merger and thus are not reflected in the table. For each of Ms. Drake and Messrs. Boehle and\nSchumacher, the pro-rata bonus component is $38,095, $14,640, and $11,204, respectively, and the cash severance component\nis $5,562,000, $1,662,500 and $1,384,126, respectively.\n(3)\nThe amounts reflect the aggregate payment that each named executive officer would receive with respect to equity awards\noutstanding and unvested as of January 15, 2021 and subject to single trigger vesting acceleration in connection with the merger,\nas described above in \u201cThe Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger -\nTreatment of Equity-Based Awards.\u201d In addition, the amounts reflect the aggregate value, based on our closing stock price on\nDecember 22, 2020, of the equity awards that vested (single trigger) on December 22, 2020 for each of the named executive\nofficers as described above in \u201cThe Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger -\nGolden Parachute Payment Mitigation.\u201d The amounts include the following for each named executive officer: For Mr.\nLichtenstein, $5,242,987 for options that vested on December 22, 2020, $3,750,000 for SARs that will vest upon\nconsummation of the Merger and $6,799,576 for restricted stock and RSU awards that will vest upon consummation of the\nMerger.

The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice and does not\nconstitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of\nrecord of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in such holder\u2019s\nname. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person,\nsuch as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized\nbelow properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of common stock through a\nbank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker\nor the other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who: (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated thereby\u037e (ii) continuously hold their shares of common stock through\nthe effective time of the Merger\u037e and (iii) otherwise follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262, will be\nentitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines\notherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the\neffective time of the Merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to exercise\nappraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy\nstatement constitutes Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection\nwith the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with\nthe Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve\nsuch holder\u2019s right to do so should review Annex D carefully.\nFailure to comply exactly with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss\nof appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nA stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described\nin the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek\nappraisal of shares of common stock, Aerojet Rocketdyne believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such\nrights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must, among other\nrequirements, do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Aerojet Rocketdyne a written demand for appraisal that complies with\nSection 262 before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting\u037e and\n86TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares of common stock through the effective time of the\nMerger.\nThe stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must also file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares of common stock within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger.\nThe Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger\nAgreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, abstain or not vote its shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Aerojet Rocketdyne,\nbefore the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, at the Special\nMeeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be\nsubmitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares, and that stockholder\nmust not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby. A holder of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date\nthe written demand for appraisal is made, and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of\nthe Merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor\nof the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and it will constitute a waiver of\nthe stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore,\na stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing\ninstructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby or\nabstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Neither\nvoting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby nor abstaining from\nvoting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby\nwill, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written\ndemand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to\nthe taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the\nSpecial Meeting will result in a loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in\nsuch holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be executed by or on\nbehalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Aerojet Rocketdyne of the identity of the holder and state\nthat the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares of common stock in connection with the\nMerger. If the shares of common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or\ncustodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record\nby more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on\nbehalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may\nexecute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or\nowners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or\nowners.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK\nACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD\nCONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR\nAPPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN\nSHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK,\nBROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW\nPROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\n87\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be delivered to:\nAerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.\nAttn: Corporate Secretary\n222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500\nEl Segundo, California 90245\nAny holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the\nconsideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Aerojet Rocketdyne a written withdrawal of\nthe demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the\neffective time of the Merger will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation.\nNo appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndeems just\u037e provided, however, that such dismissal will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the effective time of the\nMerger.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will\nnotify each holder of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262\nand who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby\nthat the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof, and include with such notice a copy of Section\n262.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of common\nstock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence\nan appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving\nCorporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares\nheld by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present\nintention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate\nany negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of\ncommon stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal\nrights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed by Section 262. The\nfailure of a holder of shares of common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 will\nnullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with\nthe requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving\nCorporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby with respect to which Aerojet Rocketdyne has\nreceived demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation\nmust mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a\nstatement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nA beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such\nperson\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing\nstatements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon\nthe Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file\nwith the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders\nwho have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not\nbeen reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of\n88\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nChancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied\nwith Section 262 and who have become entitled to exercise appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of\nChancery may require stockholders demanding appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the\nRegister in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails\nto comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery shall dismiss the appraisal proceeding unless (i) the total number of shares entitled\nto appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the\nconsideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares of common stock exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.\nUnless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective time of the\nMerger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between\nthe effective time of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. When the fair value is determined, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued during the pendency\nof the proceeding, if the Delaware Court of Chancery so determines, to the former Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders\nentitled to receive the same (in the case of shares represented by certificates, payment will not be made until such\ncertificates are surrendered to the surviving corporation). At any time before the entry of judgment in the\nproceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each former stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash,\nin which case interest shall accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount paid\nand the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore\naccrued, unless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, and, if applicable, interest, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant\nfactors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which\nare generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts\nthat could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather\napplies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,\nthe Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive\npursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking\nfirm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to,\nand does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Aerojet Rocketdyne believes that the\nMerger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could\nresult in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Aerojet\nRocketdyne nor Lockheed Martin anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder\nexercising appraisal rights, and each of Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin reserves the right to assert, in any\nappraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of common stock is less than the\nMerger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs\nof the appraisal proceedings (which do not\n89\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninclude attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\nand imposed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon\napplication of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses\nincurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\nand the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect,\nor loses or successfully withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, such stockholder\u2019s shares of common stock will\nbe deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the Merger into the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder\u2019s right to appraisal if no\npetition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger or if the stockholder delivers to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger\nConsideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the effective time of the Merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to\nvote such shares of common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the\nstock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of common stock, if any, payable to\nstockholders as of a time prior to the effective time of the Merger. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the\nstockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an\nacceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the effective time of the Merger or thereafter with the written\napproval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition\nfor appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as\nto any stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval\nof the court.\nFailure to comply exactly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to\nconsult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger and Pre-\nClosing Dividend that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of our\ncommon stock. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the \u201cCode\u201d),\nTreasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue\nService, (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which\nare subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to\nholders who hold their shares of common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code\n(generally, property held for investment purposes).\n90TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThis discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant\nto holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:\n\u2022\ntax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S.\nfederal income tax laws, such as banks and other financial institutions\u037e tax-exempt organizations\u037e retirement\nplans or other tax-deferred accounts\u037e S-corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as\npartnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and partners or investors\ntherein)\u037e insurance companies\u037e mutual funds\u037e brokers or dealers in stocks and securities\u037e traders in\nsecurities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities\u037e regulated\ninvestment companies\u037e real estate investment trusts\u037e entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules\u037e or\ncertain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders holding the shares of common stock as part of a hedging, constructive sale or\nconversion, straddle or other risk reduction transaction\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders that received their shares of common stock on exercise of notes, warrants or\noptions or in a compensatory transaction\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to U.S. Holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders that hold their shares of common stock through a bank, financial institution or\nother entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders that are, or that hold their shares of common stock through a passive foreign\ninvestment company or controlled foreign corporation\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders that hold their shares as \u201cqualified small business stock\u201d within the meaning\nof Section 1202 of the Code or Section 1244 Stock for purposes of the Code\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health\nCare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010\u037e or\n\u2022\nany state, local or foreign tax consequences.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such\npartnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.\nPartnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the\nconsequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend.\nNo ruling from the IRS and no opinion of counsel has been or will be obtained regarding the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the Merger or Pre-Closing Dividend described below, and no assurance can be given that a holder\nwould ultimately prevail if the IRS were to challenge one or more of the tax consequences described in this summary.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE\nLEGAL OR TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE\nTAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER AND PRE-CLOSING DIVIDEND IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX\nLAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION AND ANY APPLICABLE\nINCOME TAX TREATY.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the\nDistrict of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n91\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\na trust: (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of\none or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) that has a valid\nelection in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to\nthe difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares\nsurrendered pursuant to the Merger. Subject to the discussion below concerning any Pre-Closing Dividend, a U.S.\nHolder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in our shares generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares.\nSuch gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S.\nHolder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. A reduced\ntax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of an individual or other non-corporate U.S.\nHolder. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation. Gain or loss realized generally must be calculated\nseparately for each block of shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) surrendered\npursuant to the Merger.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, the per-share amount of cash payable as Merger consideration is subject\nto reduction by the per-share amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend. The Pre-Closing Dividend is payable on the\nDividend Payment Date to stockholders of record on the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date, and payment of the Pre-\nClosing Dividend is not contingent upon approval or closing of the Merger. See the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger - Pre-Closing Cash Dividend.\u201d Although the tax treatment of the Pre-Closing Dividend is not\nentirely clear, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin intend to report the Pre-Closing Dividend as a distribution\nwith respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that this\ncharacterization applies, the amount of this distribution would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of\nthe U.S. Holder\u2019s pro rata share of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits (as\ndetermined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S.\nHolder\u2019s basis in its Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock (which will correspondingly reduce such basis), and finally\nas capital gain from the sale or exchange of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. Aerojet Rocketdyne cannot predict\nwhether it will have current or accumulated earnings and profits for its current taxable year (which will end in\nconnection with the Merger). The determination of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s earnings and profits entails complex factual\nand legal analysis which cannot be completed until after the closing of the Merger. Once the determination is made,\nLockheed Martin will post this determination regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s earnings and profits for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes on its website or otherwise inform former Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s stockholders of such\ndetermination.\nAssuming the Pre-Closing Dividend will be treated as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common\nstock for U.S. federal income tax purposes, individual Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders generally should be taxed on\nthe Pre-Closing Dividend at rates applicable to long-term capital gains so long as certain holding period and other\nrequirements are met. Corporate Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders may be entitled to a dividends-received deduction\nwith respect to distributions treated as dividends if the Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholder is an otherwise qualifying\ncorporate holder that meets the holding period and certain other requirements. A dividend may be considered an\n\u201cextraordinary dividend\u201d under U.S. federal income tax rules depending on the facts and circumstances of the Aerojet\nRocketdyne stockholder. Treatment of a dividend as an extraordinary dividend may affect a corporate Aerojet\nRocketdyne stockholder\u2019s basis in its shares of common stock, or, with respect to individual stockholders, may affect\nthe tax characterization of a sale of his or her shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. Aerojet Rocketdyne\nstockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of the \u201cextraordinary dividend\u201d\nprovisions of the Code in light of their particular circumstances.\nIt is possible that the IRS could disagree with the characterization of the Pre-Closing Dividend as a distribution with\nrespect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, instead, seek to characterize\nthe Pre-Closing Dividend as additional cash received in connection with the Merger. If this characterization were to\nbe sustained, the Pre-Closing Dividend would instead be treated as additional Merger consideration, with a\ncorresponding adjustment to the gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder in the Merger.\nU.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing\nDividend in light of their particular circumstances.\n92\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock\nthat is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes.\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States\n(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed\nbase maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if such Non-U.S. Holder\nis a foreign corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax equal to 30% of its\neffectively connected earnings and profits (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger, and certain other\nspecified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of\n30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) and may be offset by certain U.S. source capital\nlosses recognized in the same taxable year\u037e or\n\u2022\nAerojet Rocketdyne is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is\ndefined in Section 897(c) of the Code (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d) at any time within the shorter of the five-year period\nending on the date of the Merger and such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable\nshares of common stock, which we refer to as the \u201cRelevant Period,\u201d and such Non-U.S. Holder owned\n(actually or constructively) more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the Relevant Period. We\nbelieve that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the\nMerger.\nAs discussed above under \u201c- U.S. Holders,\u201d although the tax treatment of the Pre-Closing Dividend is not entirely\nclear, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin intend to report the Pre-Closing Dividend as a distribution with\nrespect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that this\ncharacterization applies, the amount of this distribution would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of\nthe Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s pro rata share of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits (as\ndetermined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and subject to withholding (as discussed below), then as a return of\ncapital to the extent of the Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s basis in its Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock (which will\ncorrespondingly reduce such basis), and finally as capital gain from the sale or exchange of Aerojet Rocketdyne\ncommon stock.\nAssuming the Pre-Closing Dividend will be treated as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common\nstock for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax\nwithholding at a rate of 30% with respect to the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend treated as a taxable dividend if\nsuch dividend income is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United\nStates. The 30% rate may be reduced under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty between the United\nStates and the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is organized.\nIncome of Non-U.S. Holders that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (and attributable to a U.S.\npermanent establishment or fixed base in the case of Non-U.S. Holders subject to an applicable income tax treaty) will\nbe exempt from the U.S. federal income tax withholding described above and instead will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on a net basis at the regular graduated rates and in the manner applicable to a U.S. Holder (unless an\napplicable income tax treaty provides otherwise). In addition, a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may be subject\nto a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted\nfor certain items, unless a lower rate applies under an applicable income tax treaty. As discussed above under \u201c- U.S.\nHolders,\u201d Aerojet Rocketdyne cannot predict whether it will have current or accumulated earnings and profits for its\ncurrent taxable year (which will end in connection with the Merger). Once the determination is made, Lockheed\nMartin will post this determination regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes on its website or otherwise inform former Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s stockholders of such determination.\n93\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSince the determination of the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend that is treated as a taxable dividend will not be\ncompleted until after the closing of the Merger, it is possible that a broker, dealer, bank or other custodian that holds\nAerojet Rocketdyne common stock beneficially owned by a Non-U.S. Holder may withhold at a rate of 30% (or a\nlower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend. Non-U.S. Holders\ngenerally may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with\nthe IRS.\nAs discussed above under \u201c- U.S. Holders,\u201d it is possible that the IRS could disagree with the characterization of the\nPre-Closing Dividend as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes and, instead, seek to characterize the Pre-Closing Dividend as additional cash received in connection with\nthe Merger. If this characterization were to be sustained, the Pre-Closing Dividend would instead be treated as\nadditional Merger consideration received by a Non-U.S. Holder.\nNon-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing\nDividend in light of their particular circumstances.\nFATCA\nProvisions of the Code commonly referred to as \u201cFATCA\u201d require withholding of 30% on payments of dividends on\nAerojet Rocketdyne common stock (including potentially the Pre-Closing Dividend) to \u201cforeign financial institutions\u201d\n(which is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes investment vehicles) and certain other Non-U.S.\nentities unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by\nU.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities) have been satisfied, or an exemption applies. An\nintergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these\nrequirements. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally\nmay obtain a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant\nadministrative burden). You should consult your tax advisor regarding the effects of FATCA on your receipt of the\nPre-Closing Dividend.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (at the statutory rate) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder\npursuant to the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (i) a U.S. Holder\nthat furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup\nwithholding on a properly completed IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder that\n(A) provides a certification of such holder\u2019s foreign status on a properly completed appropriate series of IRS Form\nW-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (B) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a\nrefund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely\nfurnished to the IRS.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

            "text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nLockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne have generally agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all\nnecessary actions or approvals from governmental entities required to be obtained in connection with the execution\nof the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement. These approvals include (i) that the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, has expired or\nbeen terminated\u037e and (ii) that any approvals or consents have been obtained, and any applicable waiting periods\nhave expired, with respect to any non-US jurisdiction in which a premerger notification is required.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, each of Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin has agreed to use reasonable best\nefforts, subject to specified limitations, to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all actions or nonactions, waivers,\nauthorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances, consents and approvals required to be\nobtained (including under the HSR Act) from any governmental authorities or third parties in connection with the\nexecution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement -\nEfforts to Consummate the Merger\u201d for more information.\n94TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until Lockheed Martin\nand Aerojet Rocketdyne each file a Notification and Report Form with the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and\nthe Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has\nexpired or been terminated. In this matter, the FTC, and not the DOJ, has taken jurisdiction for the antitrust review. A\ntransaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of waiting period following the\nparties\u2019 filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms (typically a 30-day period) or the early termination of that\nwaiting period. Under the HSR rules, the acquiring person (here, Lockheed Martin), may withdraw its filing and refile\nit promptly thereafter to extend the initial HSR Act review period for another 30-day period. Before the expiration of\nthe initial waiting period, the FTC may issue a request for additional information to each of Lockheed Martin and\nAerojet Rocketdyne under the HSR Act (a \u201cSecond Request\u201d). A Second Request is a burdensome request for\ndocuments and information. Under the HSR Act, the waiting period during which the transaction cannot be\ncompleted is extended until 30 days after each party substantially complies with the Second Request. In addition, in\norder to provide for an orderly review process, parties frequently will enter into an agreement with the antitrust\nagency that they will not complete the transaction until a date that is later than 30 days after substantial compliance\nwith the Second Request. Lockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne made the necessary filings with the FTC and the\nAntitrust Division of the DOJ on January 19, 2021. The parties have concluded that no foreign premerger\nnotifications are required.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable\nstatutes, including seeking a court order to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of assets of the\nparties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual\nrights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such\naction could include seeking a court order to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of\nsubstantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing\nrelationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under\ncertain circumstances.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nOne or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when\nit grants the necessary approvals and consents. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or\nlitigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude\nobtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the\nrequired regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial\nperiod of time between the approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that\nthese regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these\nregulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the\nMerger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These\nconditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied, and could result in termination\nof the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms.\nMerger Litigation",

We examined certain publicly available business and\nfinancial information relating to AR Holdings as well as certain financial forecasts reflecting a base case and an\nadjusted base case (the \u201cForecasts\u201d), and other information and data relating to AR Holdings which were provided to\nor discussed with us by the management of AR Holdings.

In addition to the foregoing, we\nconducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and financial, economic and\nmarket criteria as we deemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion.

The right to\nindemnification conferred in this Article TENTH shall be a contract right and shall include the right of\na director or officer of the Corporation in respect of his or her acts or omissions as such directors and\nofficers and fiduciaries occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to the Effective Time to be paid by\nthe Corporation the expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in\nadvance of its final disposition\u037e provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by a\ndirector or officer of the Corporation in respect of his or her acts or omissions as such directors and\nofficers and fiduciaries occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to the Effective Time in his or her\ncapacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by\nsuch person while a director or officer including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit\nplan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the\nCorporation of an undertaking, which undertaking shall itself be sufficient without the need for further\nevaluation of any credit aspects of the undertaking or with respect to such advancement, by or on\nbehalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined\nby a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction that such director or officer is not\nentitled to be indemnified under this Article TENTH or otherwise.\nA-B-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2003\n(C) If a claim under paragraph (B) of this Article TENTH is not paid in full by the Corporation within\nsixty (60) days after a written claim, together with reasonable evidence as to the amount of such claim,\nhas been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for advancement of expenses\n(including attorneys\u2019 fees), in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the claimant\nmay at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the\nclaim, and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expense,\nincluding attorneys\u2019 fees, of prosecuting such suit. It shall be a defense to any such suit, other than a\nsuit brought to enforce a claim for expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred in defending any\nproceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has\nbeen tendered to the Corporation, that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it\npermissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but\nthe burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation\n(including the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or its\nstockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that\nindemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the\napplicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation\n(including the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or its\nstockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to\nthe suit or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In\nany suit brought by an indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses\nhereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an\nundertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to such indemnification, or to\nsuch advancement of expenses, under this Article TENTH or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.\n\u2003\n(D) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in\nadvance of its final disposition conferred in this Article TENTH shall not be exclusive of any other\nright that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of\nincorporation, bylaw, agreement, or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.\n\u2003\n(E) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,\nemployee, or agent of the Corporation in respect of his or her acts or omissions as such directors and\nofficers and fiduciaries occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to, at or after the Effective Time or\nanother corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any such expense,\nliability, or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person\nagainst such expense, liability, or loss under the DGCL.\n\u2003\n(F) In the case of a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses against the Corporation\nunder this Article TENTH arising out of acts, events, or circumstances for which the claimant, who\nwas at the relevant time serving as a director, officer, employee, or agent of any other entity at the\nrequest of the Corporation prior to the Effective Time, may be entitled to indemnification or\nadvancement of expenses pursuant to such other entity\u2019s certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or other\ngoverning document, or a contractual agreement between the claimant and such entity, the claimant\nseeking indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder shall first seek indemnification or\nadvancement of expenses pursuant to any such governing document or agreement. To the extent that\namounts to be paid in indemnification or advancement to a claimant hereunder are paid by such other\nentity, the claimant\u2019s right to indemnification and advancement of expenses hereunder shall be\nreduced.\nELEVENTH:\nMeetings of stockholders may be held within the State of Delaware or as the Bylaws may provide. The\nbooks of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the laws of the State of\nDelaware) outside of the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to\ntime by the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.\nTWELFTH:\nThe Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this\nCertificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the laws of the State of\nDelaware, and all rights conferred herein are granted subject to reservation, subject to the limitations\nin Article TENTH.\nA-B-3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nANNEX B",
