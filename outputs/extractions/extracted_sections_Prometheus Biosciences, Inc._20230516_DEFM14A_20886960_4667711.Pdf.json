            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nThe following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the special meeting (together with any\nadjournments or postponements thereof, the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d), the Merger Agreement (as defined below) and the transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub (as defined below) will be merged with and into Prometheus (as defined below), with\nPrometheus surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck (as defined below) (the \u201cMerger\u201d).

The board of directors of\nPrometheus (the \u201cBoard\u201d) is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of\nPrometheus common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cCompany Shares\u201d), in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at\nthe Special Meeting.\n \nQ:\nWhat is the proposed transaction?\n \nA:\nThe proposed transaction is the acquisition of Prometheus by Merck pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement (the \u201cMerger Proposal\u201d) is approved by the holders of a majority of the Company Shares issued and outstanding and entitled to\nvote thereon as of the Record Date (as defined below) and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or\nwaived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Prometheus, with Prometheus surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.\nAs a result of the Merger, Company Shares will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market\n(\u201cNasdaq\u201d). In addition, Company Shares will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d),\nand Prometheus will no longer file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).\n \nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is consummated?\n \nA:\nUpon consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive $200.00 in cash, without interest (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d), for each\nCompany Share that you own as of the Effective Time (as defined below), unless you have properly exercised and not failed to perfect, waived,\nwithdrawn or otherwise lost your right to appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware\n(the \u201cDGCL\u201d). For example, if you own 100 Company Shares as of the Effective Time, you will receive $20,000.00 in cash in exchange for your\nCompany Shares (less any applicable withholding taxes). You will not be entitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or in Merck as\na result of the Merger.\n \n1Table of Contents\nQ:\nHow does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Company Shares prior to the public announcement that Prometheus\nentered into the Merger Agreement? How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Company Shares as of a recent\ntrading date?\n \nA:\nThe Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 75% over the closing price of the Company Shares on Nasdaq of $114.01 on\nApril 14, 2023, the last trading day before the public announcement that Prometheus entered into the Merger Agreement. On May 15, 2023, the\nlast practicable day before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price of the Company Shares on Nasdaq was $194.43 per share.

As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 47,813,238 Company Shares issued and outstanding.\nEach issued and outstanding Company Share on that date will entitle its holder to one vote, in person or by proxy, on all matters to be voted\non at the Special Meeting.\n \nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement?\n \nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Company Shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon as of the Record\nDate is required to approve the Merger Proposal.\nThe failure to grant a proxy to vote your Company Shares by submitting a signed proxy card, granting a proxy electronically over the Internet\nor by telephone or to vote at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal. If you hold your\nCompany Shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company Shares on the\nMerger Proposal will result in a broker non-vote and will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal. Abstentions by you\nor your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\n \n2\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat factors did the Board consider in deciding to enter into the Merger Agreement and recommending the approval of the Merger\nProposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?\n \nA:\nIn reaching its decision to unanimously approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, and to recommend that our stockholders approve the Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment\nProposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of the proposed\nMerger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, as well as other alternatives. For a more detailed\ndescription of these factors, see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 46 of this\nproxy statement.\n \nQ:\nWhat is a quorum and how many Company Shares are needed to constitute a quorum?\n \nA:\nA quorum of stockholders is the presence of stockholders holding the minimum number of shares necessary to transact business at the\nSpecial Meeting. The holders of a majority of the voting power of Company Shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, either present in\nperson or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present, then under our amended and\nrestated bylaws, either (i) a majority in voting power of the stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, present at the Special Meeting\nin person or represented by proxy, or (ii) the chairperson of the Special Meeting, may each adjourn the meeting, and the meeting may be held\nas adjourned without further notice other than an announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken of the time, place, if any,\nthereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person\nand vote at such adjourned meeting.\nIf you submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or vote at the Special Meeting (regardless of\nwhether you indicate how you wish to vote), your Company Shares will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If\nyou hold your Company Shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company\nShares will result in a broker non-vote and such Company Shares will not be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\nHowever, if you hold Company Shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at\nleast one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those Company Shares will be deemed\npresent at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any\nproposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank,\nbroker or other nominee will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\n \nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to Prometheus\u2019\nnamed executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?\n \nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively (excluding abstentions) at the\nSpecial Meeting by the holders entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Merger Compensation Proposal.\nThe failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote\nat the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. If you hold your Company Shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the\nfailure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company Shares will result in a broker non-vote and will not have\nany effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or\n \n3\nTable of Contents\nother nominee are not considered to be votes cast and will have no effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal.  \nBecause the vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Prometheus or Merck. Accordingly, if\nthe Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable\nthereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Prometheus\u2019 stockholders on the Merger Compensation Proposal.\n \nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit\nadditional proxies?\n \nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively (excluding abstentions) at the\nSpecial Meeting by the holders entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal.\nThe failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote\nat the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your Company Shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to\ninstruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company Shares will result in a broker non-vote and will not have any effect\non the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee are not considered to be votes cast and will have no\neffect on the Adjournment Proposal.\n \nQ:\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote?\n \nA:\nThe Board, after considering the various factors described under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 46 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Prometheus and its stockholders and declared it advisable for\nPrometheus to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution and delivery by Prometheus of the Merger\nAgreement, the performance by Prometheus of its covenants and agreements contained therein and the consummation of the Merger and the\nother transactions contemplated thereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, (iii) directed that the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of Prometheus\u2019 stockholders and (iv) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set\nforth in the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Prometheus\u2019 stockholders.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Compensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the\nAdjournment Proposal.\n \nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\n \nA:\nWe encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, and the documents we\nincorporate by reference and refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you, and then sign, date and\nreturn, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically on the Internet\nor by telephone, so that your Company Shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your Company Shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d please\nrefer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your Company Shares. Please do not send your\nstock certificates with your proxy card.\n \n4\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nHow do I vote?\n \nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your Company Shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust\nCompany, N.A. (\u201cComputershare\u201d)), there are four ways to cause your Company Shares to be voted at the Special Meeting:\n \n\u2022\nby visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card and granting your proxy\u037e\n \n\u2022\nby calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card and granting your proxy\u037e\n \n\u2022\nby completing, dating, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nby voting virtually at the Special Meeting\u037e to vote your shares at the Special Meeting, you must pre-register at\nwww.proxydocs.com/RXDX by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting. Company Shares held\ndirectly in your name as a stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website, provided you\nhave pre-registered for the Special Meeting. Company Shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special\nMeeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee, and provided you have pre-registered for the\nSpecial Meeting.\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d each of the Merger\nProposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.\nA control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to grant a proxy to vote your Company Shares,\nand to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when granting a proxy electronically over the Internet or by\ntelephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for granting a proxy to vote your Company Shares, if you grant a proxy\nelectronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as telephone and Internet access charges for which you will be\nresponsible. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, you are strongly encouraged to grant a proxy to vote your Company Shares.\nIf your Company Shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your\nbroker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your Company Shares. Without those\ninstructions, your Company Shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\n \nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding Company Shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\n \nA:\nIf your Company Shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those\nCompany Shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by\nor on behalf of Prometheus.\nIf your Company Shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of such Company Shares\nand are considered to hold them in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other\nnominee who is considered, with respect to those Company Shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the\nright to direct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to\nattend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your Company Shares at the Special\nMeeting unless you request and obtain a valid \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee.\n \n5\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWill my Company Shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with Company Shares\nI hold as the stockholder of record?\n \nA:\nNo. Because any Company Shares you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any Company\nShares you hold as the stockholder of record, any Company Shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be combined for voting purposes with the\nCompany Shares you hold as the stockholder of record. Similarly, if you own Company Shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with\nyour spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those\nCompany Shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Company Shares held by a corporation or business entity must\nbe voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Company Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules\ngoverning the account.\n \nQ:\nIf I hold my Company Shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my bank, broker or other nominee vote my Company Shares for me on the proposals to\nbe considered at the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nNot without your direction. Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your Company Shares on any \u201cnon-routine\u201d\nproposal if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other\nnominees have the discretion to vote your Company Shares on routine matters if you fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on\nhow to vote your Company Shares with respect to such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and banks,\nbrokers and other nominees therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you instruct\nyour bank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your Company Shares.\nYou should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to instruct them, as applicable, to vote your Company\nShares. Without such instructions, a broker non-vote will result, and your Company Shares will not be voted at the Special Meeting. A broker\nnon-vote will have the same effect as if you voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote?\n \nA:\nThe required vote to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of Company Shares issued and outstanding as of the close of\nbusiness on the Record Date, not just the Company Shares that are voted at the Special Meeting. If you do not vote in person or by proxy, it\nwill have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\n \nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or otherwise submitted my vote by proxy?\n \nA:\nYes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time by:\n \n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation of your proxy to our Corporate Secretary at Prometheus Biosciences, Inc., Attention: Corporate\nSecretary, 3050 Science Park Road, San Diego, CA 92121 prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special\nMeeting\u037e\n \n\u2022\nsigning a new proxy card with a date later than the date of the previously submitted proxy card relating to the same Company Shares\nand returning it to us by mail prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting\u037e\n \n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting\u037e\n \n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy by Internet prior to the start of the Special Meeting\u037e or\n \n6\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nattending the Special Meeting and voting thereat (simply attending the Special Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked).\nPlease note that if you hold your Company Shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your\nCompany Shares, the above-described options for revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you should contact your bank,\nbroker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change or revoke your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting via the\nSpecial Meeting website, provided you have pre-registered for the Special Meeting.\n \nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\n \nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person (a \u201cproxy\u201d) to vote your Company Shares. This written document describing the matters\nto be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your\nCompany Shares is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d The Board has designated each of Mark C. McKenna, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Timothy K. Andrews, General Counsel, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.\n \nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the Company Shares voted?\n \nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to grant a proxy to vote your Company Shares, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or\nyour proxies, will vote your Company Shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy\ncard, you may specify whether your Company Shares should be voted \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d or to abstain from voting on all, some or none\nof the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your Company Shares should be voted on a matter, the Company\nShares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Compensation Proposal\nand (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\n \nQ:\nMay I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?\n \nA:\nAll stockholders of Prometheus as of the Record Date may attend and vote at the virtual Special Meeting. You will not be able to attend the\nSpecial Meeting physically in person. To vote your Company Shares at the Special Meeting, you must pre-register for the Special Meeting at\nwww.proxydocs.com/RXDX by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting. For additional information on\nhow to pre-register for the Special Meeting, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u2014Pre-Registering for the Special Meeting\u201d\nbeginning on page 28 of this proxy statement.\nCompany Shares held directly in your name as a stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website,\nprovided you have pre-registered for the Special Meeting. Shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special\nMeeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee and provided you have pre-registered for the Special\nMeeting.\nEven if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy or grant a proxy\nelectronically over the Internet or via telephone to ensure that your Company Shares will be represented at the Special Meeting. If you hold\nyour Company Shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your Company Shares at the Special\nMeeting unless you request and obtain a valid \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee.\n \n7\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my Company Shares before consummation of the Merger?\n \nA:\nIf you sell or transfer your Company Shares before consummation of the Merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the Merger\nConsideration in the Merger. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your Company Shares through consummation of the\nMerger.\nThe Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the date the Merger is anticipated to be consummated.\nAccordingly, if you sell or transfer your Company Shares after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements\n(such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your Company Shares and each of\nyou notifies Prometheus in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger\nis consummated, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your Company Shares, but you will have retained your right to vote these\nCompany Shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your Company Shares after the Record Date, we encourage\nyou to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or grant a proxy via the Internet or telephone. \n \nQ:\nHow will I receive the Merger Consideration to which I am entitled?\n \nA:\nIf you hold your Company Shares in certificated form, you will receive a letter of transmittal shortly after the Merger is consummated\ninstructing you how to surrender your stock certificates, to an exchange agent to be designated by Merck in order to receive the Merger\nConsideration to which you are entitled. Please do not send in your stock certificates now. If you hold your Company Shares in book-entry\nform but not through the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d), you will receive instructions regarding delivery of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d with\nrespect to such book-entry shares. If your Company Shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive\ninstructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d\nCompany Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.\n \nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificate(s) now or other evidence of ownership now?\n \nA:\nNo. Please do not send in your stock certificates or other documents evidencing ownership of Company Shares now or with your proxy card.\n \nQ:\nI do not know where my stock certificate is. How will I get the Merger Consideration for my Company Shares?\n \nA:\nIf the Merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the consummation of the Merger will include the procedures that\nyou must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your\nstock certificate. You may also be required to post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.\n \nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be consummated?\n \nA:\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, adoption of the Merger Agreement and\napproval of the Merger by the holders of a majority of the Company Shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon as of the\nRecord Date, the expiration or termination of the required waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-\nRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), and certain other conditions.\n \n8\nTable of Contents\nWe currently anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the third quarter of 2023, assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the\nconditions to the Merger. However, it is possible, including as a result of factors outside the control of Prometheus and Merck, that the Merger\nwill be consummated at a later time or not at all.\n \nQ:\nWhat effects will the Merger have on Prometheus?\n \nA:\nThe Company Shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act, and are listed on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cRXDX.\u201d As a result of the\nMerger, Prometheus will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck. As soon as reasonably\npracticable following the consummation of the Merger, the Company Shares will cease trading on and be delisted from Nasdaq and will be\nderegistered under the Exchange Act, and Prometheus will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC.\n \nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal?\n \nA:\nIn accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing you with the opportunity to cast a non-\nbinding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Merger Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nApproval of the Merger Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Merger\nCompensation Proposal is on an advisory basis and will not be binding on Prometheus or Merck. Further, the underlying compensation plans\nand agreements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is\napproved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the\noutcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Prometheus\u2019 stockholders on the Merger Compensation Proposal.\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not consummated?\n \nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Company Shares entitled to vote thereon\nas of the Record Date or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, Prometheus stockholders will not receive any payment for\ntheir Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, Prometheus will remain a public company, the Company Shares will\ncontinue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nUnder specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Merck a termination fee of $325,364,166 upon the termination of the Merger\nAgreement (the \u201cPrometheus Termination Fee\u201d) as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee\u037e Certain Expenses\u201d beginning\non page 100 of this proxy statement.\n \nQ:\nDo any directors or executive officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of Prometheus stockholders generally?\n \nA:\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive\nofficers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder.

If the Effective Time occurs during one or more of the Final Offering Periods, (w)\nthe final exercise date(s) under the ESPP will be such date as Prometheus determines in its sole discretion (which date must be no later than the\ndate that is five business days prior to the Effective Time), (x) each ESPP participant\u2019s accumulated contributions under the ESPP will be used\nto purchase Company Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of such final exercise date, and (y) as promptly as practicable\nfollowing the purchase of Company Shares in accordance with the preceding clause (x), Prometheus will return to each participant the funds, if\nany, that remain in such participant\u2019s account after such purchase.\nFor additional information regarding the ESPP, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP\u201d beginning on page 79\nof this proxy statement.\n \nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights instead of receiving the Merger Consideration for my Company Shares under the DGCL?\n \nA:\nYes. As a holder of record or beneficial owner of Company Shares, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection\nwith the Merger if you take certain actions and meet certain conditions. Under the DGCL, stockholders and beneficial owners of Company\nShares who do not vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their Company Shares as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is consummated, but only if they comply fully with all applicable requirements of\nSection 262 of the DGCL. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger\nConsideration. Any stockholder or beneficial owner intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other things, submit a written demand\nfor appraisal to Prometheus before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement is taken and must not vote or otherwise submit a proxy\nto vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL will\nresult in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your\nappraisal rights we encourage you to seek the advice of your own legal counsel. See \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 68\nof this proxy statement.\n \n1\n1\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\n \nA:\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting\ninstruction cards.

Please complete, date, sign and return (or grant a proxy to vote via the Internet or\ntelephone with respect to) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive to ensure that all of your Company Shares are voted.\n \nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\n \nA:\nThe SEC permits us to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary\ninstructions have been received, but only if we provide advance notice and follow certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder\ncontinues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card.

On April 15, 2023, Centerview rendered to the Board\nits oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 15, 2023 that, as of such date and based upon and\nsubject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by\nCenterview in preparing its opinion, the Merger Consideration proposed to be paid to the holders of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares)\npursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of Centerview\u2019s written opinion, dated April 15, 2023, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex B and is\nincorporated herein by reference. Centerview\u2019s financial advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the\nBoard (in their capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for purposes of its consideration of the Merger and\nother transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and Centerview\u2019s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as\nof the date thereof, to the holders of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders\npursuant to the Merger Agreement.

In connection with Centerview\u2019s services as the\nfinancial advisor to the Board, Prometheus has agreed to pay Centerview an aggregate fee of $70.5 million, $2.0 million of which was payable upon\nthe earlier to occur of (i) the date on which Centerview advised the Board that it was prepared to render its opinion and (ii) the rendering of the\nopinion and $68.5 million of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the Merger. \nThe full text of Centerview\u2019s written opinion should be read carefully in its entirety for a description of the assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion.\n \n15\nTable of Contents\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.

Goldman Sachs provided advisory\nservices and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Company Shares should vote\nwith respect to the Merger or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between Prometheus and Goldman Sachs, Prometheus has agreed\nto pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of approximately $70.5 million, $1 million of which became payable upon the announcement of the Merger,\nand the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger.\nCertain Effects of the Merger on Prometheus (page 38)\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Prometheus, with\nPrometheus surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck. Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term \u201csurviving corporation\u201d to refer\nto Prometheus as the surviving corporation following the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of\nthe surviving corporation. The Effective Time will occur, if it occurs, upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State\nof Delaware (or at such later date and time as we and Merck may agree in writing and specify in such certificate of merger). Throughout this proxy\nstatement, we use the term \u201cClosing Date\u201d to refer to the date on which the closing of the Merger occurs.\nEffect on Prometheus if the Merger Is Not Consummated (page 38)\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Company Shares entitled to vote thereon\nas of the Record Date or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, Prometheus stockholders will not receive any payment for their\nCompany Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, Prometheus will remain a public company, the Company Shares will continue to be\nlisted and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified\ncircumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, Prometheus may be required to pay Merck a termination fee, as described under \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee\u037e Certain Expenses\u201d beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement. Additionally, a reverse termination fee\nmay be payable by Merck to Prometheus in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, as described under\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee\u037e Certain Expenses\u201d beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement.\nFurthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be consummated, the price of\nthe Company Shares may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the Company Shares would return to the\nprice at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.\nMerger Consideration (page 39)\nIn the Merger, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than as described herein) will be\ncanceled and extinguished and automatically, without any action by the holders\n \n16\nTable of Contents\nof such Company Shares, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and each holder of a share represented by a certificate\n(\u201cCertificates\u201d) or non-certificated and represented by book-entry (\u201cBook-Entry Shares\u201d), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented\nCompany Shares, will cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As\ndescribed further under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Payment for Company Shares\u201d beginning on page 80 of this proxy statement, prior to the Closing\nDate, Merck will deposit or cause to be deposited cash in an amount necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration with an exchange agent\ndesignated by Merck that is reasonably acceptable to Prometheus (the \u201cpaying agent\u201d) (which amount will not include any amounts payable to the\nholders of Prometheus equity awards). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, holders of Certificates will receive a letter of transmittal\ninstructing them to send their Certificates to the exchange agent in order to receive the Merger Consideration for each Company Share represented\nby such Certificates.\nEach Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by Prometheus, Merck, Merger Sub, or by\nany direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Prometheus, Merck or Merger Sub (\u201cCanceled Company Shares\u201d) will automatically be canceled\nand extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor at the Effective Time.\nFurther, any Company Shares that are issued and outstanding and held by Prometheus stockholders (or held in a voting trust or by a nominee\non behalf of a beneficial owner who beneficially owns such Company Shares) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who are entitled to\ndemand and who shall have properly and validly demanded their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Company Shares in compliance in all\nrespects with Section 262 of the DGCL (\u201cSection 262\u201d) (collectively, \u201cDissenting Company Shares\u201d) will not be converted into, or represent the\nright to receive, the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof will be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262. See \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 68 of this proxy statement for more information.\nAfter the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but\nyou will no longer have any rights as a Prometheus stockholder as a result of the Merger (except that any holder of Dissenting Company Shares will\nhave those rights granted under Section 262), nor will you be entitled to receive any shares in Merck or the surviving corporation.\nTreatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP (page 79)\nUnder the Merger Agreement, each Prometheus stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,\nwhether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by\nmultiplying (i) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such Prometheus stock option by (ii) an amount equal to the Merger\nConsideration less the applicable per share exercise price of such Prometheus stock option.\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that each Prometheus RSU award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of\nCompany Shares underlying such Prometheus RSU award by (ii) the Merger Consideration.\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that each Company Share issued under Prometheus\u2019 2021 Incentive Award Plan or 2017 Equity Incentive\nPlan that is subject to vesting or forfeiture conditions and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a \u201cPrometheus Restricted\nShare\u201d) will vest in full and be treated the same as all other Company Shares and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.\nAll amounts that become due in respect of outstanding Prometheus equity or equity-based awards described herein will be less any required\nwithholding taxes and without interest.  \n \n17\nTable of Contents\nExcept for the Final Offering Periods under the ESPP, no new offering periods under the ESPP will commence following April 15, 2023, there will\nbe no increase in the amount of payroll deductions or payroll contributions permitted to be made by the participants under the ESPP during the\ncurrent offering periods, except those made in accordance with payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of April 15, 2023, and no individuals\nwill commence participation in the ESPP following April 15, 2023. If the Effective Time occurs during one or more of the Final Offering Periods, (w) the\nfinal exercise date(s) under the ESPP will be such date as Prometheus determines in its sole discretion (which date must be no later than the date that\nis five business days prior to the Effective Time), (x) each ESPP participant\u2019s accumulated contributions under the ESPP will be used to purchase\nCompany Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of such final exercise date, which shares, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to\nthe Effective Time, will be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and (y) as promptly as\npracticable following the purchase of Company Shares in accordance with the preceding clause (x), Prometheus will return to each participant the\nfunds, if any, that remain in such participant\u2019s account after such purchase. If the Effective Time occurs after the end of both of the Final Offering\nPeriods, (x) all amounts allocated to each participant\u2019s account under the ESPP at the end of each of the Final Offering Periods shall be used to\npurchase whole Company Shares under the terms of the ESPP for such offering period, which shares, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to\nthe Effective Time, will be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and (y) as promptly as\npracticable following the purchase of Company Shares in accordance with the preceding clause (x), Prometheus will return to each participant the\nfunds, if any, that remain in such participant\u2019s account after such purchase.\nInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Prometheus in the Merger (page 64)\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, our stockholders should be aware that members of the\nBoard and Prometheus\u2019 executive officers may have various interests in the Merger that may be in addition to, or different from, the interests of\nPrometheus stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of these potential interests and considered them at the time they\napproved the Merger Agreement and in making their recommendation that the Prometheus stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These\npotential interests include, but may not be limited to:\n \n\u2022\neach member of the Board and each of Prometheus\u2019 executive officers holds outstanding Prometheus equity awards. All such equity\nawards outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement will be afforded the treatment described above under \u201c\u2014Treatment of\nPrometheus Equity Awards and the ESPP\u201d\u037e\n \n\u2022\neach of Prometheus\u2019 executive officers is party to a preexisting employment letter agreement that provides for severance payments and\nbenefits upon a qualifying termination, and in Mr. McKenna\u2019s case, enhanced severance payments and benefits in connection with a\nchange in control (including the Merger)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nif an executive officer experiences a qualifying termination prior to payment of fiscal year 2023 bonuses, the executive officer will receive\nhis or her 2023 bonus, paid at two-hundred percent (200%) of target (which will be prorated if such termination occurs prior to\nDecember 31, 2023)\u037e and\n \n\u2022\ncontinued indemnification in favor of the current and former directors and officers of Prometheus, as well as certain obligations related\nto maintenance of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance.\nFor additional information on the potential interests of members of the Board and Prometheus\u2019 executive officers in the Merger, see \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Prometheus in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 64 of this proxy statement.\n \n18\nTable of Contents\nFinancing of the Merger (page 68)\nThe consummation of the Merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Merck. Merck and Merger Sub have represented in the\nMerger Agreement that they have available or, with respect to Merger Sub, will have available as of the Effective Time, sufficient funds for the\nsatisfaction of all of their obligations under the Merger Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses required to be paid by Merck or Merger\nSub pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nAppraisal Rights (page 68)\nIf the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their Company\nShares under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of\ntheir Company Shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The \u201cfair value\u201d of your\nCompany Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are\notherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as \u201cappraisal rights\u201d. This proxy statement serves as a notice of\nsuch appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.\nPersons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to\nreceive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of their Company Shares following\npetition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of\ntheir Company Shares determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would\notherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights.\nConsequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult\ntheir legal and financial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.\nA holder of record of Company Shares and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds or beneficially owns, as applicable, such Company\nShares through the Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to the Merger in writing or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn,\nlost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand\nfor appraisal of such Company Shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the\nholder of record of the Company Shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial\nownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at\nwhich such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Prometheus and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 68 of this proxy statement), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its\nCompany Shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.\nA copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal\nrights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who\ndesires to\n \n19\nTable of Contents\nexercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or\nattempting to exercise such rights. For more information, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 68 of\nthis proxy statement.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Company Shares (page 72)\nThe receipt of cash for Company Shares pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt\nof cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for such U.S. Holder\u2019s Company Shares in the Merger generally will result in such U.S. Holder\u2019s recognition of\ngain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the cash such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted\ntax basis in the Company Shares surrendered in the Merger. A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect\nto the exchange of Company Shares for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States. Stockholders\nshould refer to the discussion under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Company Shares\u201d\nbeginning on page 72 of this proxy statement and consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the\nMerger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or\nother tax laws.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 75)\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be consummated until the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the\nHSR Act has expired or been terminated. Prometheus and Merck filed their respective HSR Act notifications on April 21, 2023. We currently do not\nexpect that any other clearance, approval or consent would be required under any other applicable antitrust law in connection with the Merger.\nLitigation Related to the Merger (page 77)\nOn May 9, 2023, two lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Prometheus and the\nmembers of the Board: O\u2019Dell v. Prometheus Biosciences, Inc., Case No. 23-cv-3862, and Wang v. Prometheus Biosciences, Inc., Case No. 23-cv-\n03875. The lawsuits allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by Prometheus on April 28, 2023 with the SEC in connection with the Merger\nomits material information with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, rendering it false and misleading in violation of\nSections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief, rescission, declaratory relief and unspecified\nmonetary damages. Prometheus believes these lawsuits are wholly without merit. Additional lawsuits regarding the Merger may be filed.\nNo Solicitation\u037e Prometheus Acquisition Proposals\u037e Company Board Recommendation Change (page 90)\nFrom the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and\nthe Effective Time, Prometheus will not, and will cause its directors and officers not

affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Shares\nentitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date in favor of the Merger Proposal (the \u201cPrometheus Stockholder Approval\u201d), Prometheus or any of its\nrepresentatives has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any person or group of persons that did not result from a material breach\nof Prometheus\u2019 obligations related to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement, then if the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in\ngood faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely\nto lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined and described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014No Solicitation\u037e\nPrometheus Acquisition Proposals\u037e Company Board Recommendation Change\u201d beginning on page 90 of this proxy statement) and that the failure\nto take action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Prometheus may, subject to certain\nrequirements:\n \n\u2022\nenter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014\nNo Solicitation\u037e Prometheus Acquisition

and\n \n\u2022\nparticipate and engage in discussions or negotiations with the person or group of persons making such Acquisition Proposal regarding\nsuch Acquisition Proposal.\nBefore obtaining the Prometheus Stockholder Approval, the Board, in response to (i) the receipt of a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal\nafter the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result from a material breach of Prometheus\u2019 covenants and agreements related to non-\nsolicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement, or (ii) the occurrence of an Intervening Event (as defined and described under \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014No Solicitation\u037e Prometheus Acquisition Proposals\u037e Company Board Recommendation Change\u201d\nbeginning on page 90 of

\n21\nTable of Contents\nprocedures specified in the Merger Agreement, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such applicable Acquisition Proposal and terminate\nthe Merger Agreement.\nHowever, the Board is not permitted to take the actions described in the paragraph immediately above unless, among other things, (i) the\nBoard (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would\nbe reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (ii) in the case of receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the Board\n(or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition\nProposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, that an Intervening Event has occurred, (iii) Prometheus provides\nwritten notice to Merck at least three (3) business days prior to effecting a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating the Merger\nAgreement of its intent to take such action, specifying the reasons therefor, (iv) Prometheus is, and causes its representatives to be, reasonably\navailable to negotiate with Merck in good faith (to the extent Merck desires to negotiate) during such three business day period to make such\nadjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as would obviate the basis for a Company Board Recommendation Change or the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement, and (v) no earlier than the end of such three business day period, the Board (or a committee thereof)\ndetermines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), after considering any amendments to the terms\nand conditions of the Merger Agreement proposed by Merck in a binding written offer irrevocably made by Merck during such three business day\nperiod, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law (and, in the\ncase of receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal). In the event of any\nchange to the financial terms (including any change to the amount or form of consideration payable) or other revision to the terms or conditions of\nsuch Acquisition Proposal, Prometheus must provide written notice to Merck at least two business days prior to effecting a Company Board\nRecommendation Change or terminating the Merger Agreement of its intent to take such action, specifying the reasons therefor and, if requested by\nMerck, negotiate with Merck in good faith (to the extent Merck desires to negotiate) during such period to make such adjustments in the

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement were the result of extensive negotiations between Prometheus, Merck and their respective affiliates and\nrepresentatives. The following is a brief description of the background of the Merger and related transactions.\nThe Board, together with members of senior management of Prometheus, regularly reviews and assesses the performance, future growth prospects,\nbusiness plans and the overall strategic direction of Prometheus, and considers a variety of strategic alternatives that may be available to Prometheus,\nincluding continuing to pursue its strategy as a standalone company or pursuing potential strategic or financing transactions with third parties, in each\ncase, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value.\nAs part of that review, on May 19, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs, financial advisor to Prometheus, and Latham & Watkins LLP (\u201cLatham\u201d), legal advisor to Prometheus, in attendance, during which representatives\nof Goldman Sachs presented to the Board regarding the current environment of biopharmaceutical capital markets and M&A transactions and\nconsiderations associated therewith, including the current regulatory environment, as well as potential financing windows for Prometheus.\n \n39Table of Contents\nAlso in May 2022, members of Prometheus management met with representatives of Centerview to discuss market conditions, industry\ntransactions, and potential strategic opportunities.\nOn August 11, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Latham in\nattendance, during which representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed current biopharmaceutical capital markets and M&A considerations, including\nrecently announced transactions, and reviewed process and timeline considerations related to strategic partnering and financing opportunities for\nPrometheus. After the discussion, the Board authorized Prometheus to (i) explore potential strategic partnering and financing opportunities and (ii) taking\ninto account a number of factors, including its familiarity with Prometheus, its reputation as an internationally recognized investment banking firm, and its\nsubstantial experience with respect to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, engage Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor in connection\nwith this review of strategic alternatives.\nOn September 27, 2022, Prometheus entered into an engagement letter with Goldman Sachs to explore potential strategic opportunities.\nFrom October 2022 to early December 2022, Prometheus management, with the assistance of representatives of Goldman Sachs, identified potential\nparties for a partnership with respect to PRA023, including to co-develop and co-commercialize PRA023 worldwide, and, at the direction of Prometheus\nmanagement, representatives of Goldman Sachs conducted outreach to seventeen parties, comprised of large and mid-cap pharmaceutical companies,\nincluding Merck, Party V, Party W, Party X, Party Y and Party Z, to discuss such opportunities. All but one of the parties contacted expressed interest in\nexploring a partnership with Prometheus and of those sixteen potential counterparties, each either had an existing non-disclosure agreement in place with\nPrometheus from a prior business opportunity or entered into a new non-disclosure agreement in connection with this outreach. Of the sixteen non-\ndisclosure agreements, ten included a standstill provision, none of which included a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provision with respect thereto. Each of the\nsixteen parties was given access to a virtual data room enabling them to conduct due diligence regarding Prometheus and Prometheus management gave\nmanagement presentations to each of the parties. Members of Prometheus management also responded to due diligence requests from the parties.\nOn November 10, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Latham in\nattendance, during which Goldman Sachs presented on and discussed with the Board strategic opportunities that might become available to Prometheus\nfollowing the planned release of results of its ARTEMIS-UC Phase 2 and APOLLO-CD Phase 2a studies and in the context of the broader financial\nmarkets.\nOn November 30, 2022, members of Prometheus management met with representatives of Centerview to discuss market conditions, industry\ntransactions, and potential strategic opportunities.\nOn December 6, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Latham in attendance, to discuss\nPrometheus\u2019 ARTEMIS-UC Phase 2 and APOLLO-CD Phase 2a study results. Members of Prometheus management presented to the Board regarding the\npositive trial results and discussed the expected market reaction to the trial results announcement in the context of a potential financing. Taking into\naccount the positive trial results and cash runway considerations, the Board then determined it was in the best interests of Prometheus and its\nstockholders to prepare for a potential equity financing, and the Board authorized the creation of a pricing committee of the Board, composed of Mark\nMcKenna, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer at Prometheus, Joseph Papa and Martin Hendrix, both members of the Board, and delegated\nto the pricing committee the authority to determine and approve the aggregate number of shares to be sold and the price per share for a common stock\nequity capital raise.\nOn December 7, 2022, Prometheus publicly announced (i) positive top line results for PRA023 in both its ARTEMIS-UC Phase 2 study and its\nAPOLLO-CD Phase 2a study and its intention to advance PRA023 into\n \n40\nTable of Contents\nPhase 3 for ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease indications and (ii) a proposed $250 million public offering of common stock, with Goldman Sachs,\namong others, acting as joint bookrunning manager for the offering. The price of a Company Share closed at $36.06 on December 6, 2022 and $95.80 on\nDecember 7, 2022 and opened at $103.06 on December 8, 2023.\nOn December 8, 2022, after approval of the pricing committee of the Board, Prometheus announced the pricing of an upsized common stock offering\nfor gross proceeds, after exercise in full of the underwriters\u2019 over-allotment option, of $550 million at a price of $110.00 per share. The offering closed on\nDecember 13, 2022.\nFollowing the announcement of positive trial results and the successful common stock offering, Prometheus management, in consultation with the\nBoard and separately with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Centerview, determined to pause any near-term partnership discussions, and between\nDecember 10, 2022 and December 11, 2022, Mr. McKenna contacted each of the previously interested parties to inform them that Prometheus was no\nlonger moving forward with a formal process for potential partnership opportunities and would be shutting down access to the virtual data room.\nFrom December 2022 until late March 2023, members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Centerview had regular\ncommunications with a number of the previously contacted parties, including Merck, Party V, Party W, Party X, Party Y and Party Z, in order to respond to\nquestions and provide regular updates regarding Prometheus\u2019 business, and members of senior Prometheus management met in person at the J.P. Morgan\nAnnual Healthcare Conference in January 2023 with representatives of Merck, Party V, Party W, Party X and Party Y and subsequently met with Party Z.\nThroughout these meetings, representatives of Merck, Party V, Party W, Party X, Party Y and Party Z confirmed that they remained interested in a\npotential strategic transaction with Prometheus but did not make any proposals with respect to a transaction. Over the course of these meetings and\nupon request, interested parties had their access to the virtual data room restored, with Merck receiving access on January 12, 2023, Party W receiving\naccess on January 23, 2023 and Party X receiving access on March 14, 2023.\nAs part of the communications described in the immediately preceding paragraph, on January 19, 2023, Sunil Patel, Senior Vice President and Head\nof Corporate Development & Licensing at Merck, called Mr. McKenna to express continued interest in Prometheus and requested access to certain\ndiligence materials which were subsequently provided by Prometheus to Merck. On February 9, 2023, Mr. Patel again spoke with Mr. McKenna and\nexpressed Merck\u2019s significant interest in a potential strategic transaction between the two companies.\nOn March 6, 2023, representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke to a representative of Party V who advised that Party V was stopping further evaluation\nof a potential strategic transaction with Prometheus.\nOn March 7, 2023, Mr. McKenna met with a representative of Party Z, who indicated that Party Z was unlikely to move forward with a potential\nacquisition of Prometheus. On the same day, members of the senior management of Prometheus met with representatives of Merck and further discussed\nMerck\u2019s interest in the transaction.\nOn March 27, 2023, the Board held a meeting with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Centerview and Latham in\nattendance. During the meeting, representatives of Centerview gave a presentation on Centerview\u2019s experience with M&A in the pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology industries and their view with respect to the M&A environment in general, including specific considerations for Prometheus. The Board\nalso discussed with its advisors potential capital raise opportunities in 2023.\nOn March 31, 2023, Mr. Patel and Rob Davis, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer at Merck, called Mr. McKenna to inform him that\nMerck would submit an offer to acquire all of the outstanding Company Shares at $150.00 per share and expressed that Merck wished to move quickly\ntowards executing transaction documents. Later that day, Merck submitted a written non-binding indication of interest to acquire all outstanding\nCompany Shares at $150.00 per share in cash (the \u201cMarch 31 Offer\u201d), with a targeted signing date of April 21, 2023. During these discussions with Merck\nand in connection with all other discussions\n \n41\nTable of Contents\nwith Merck and all other potential bidders, there was no discussion between representatives of Prometheus and representatives of any other party with\nrespect to post-closing employment or compensation for members of Prometheus management.\nLater on March 31, 2023, the Board met, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Latham\nin attendance, to review and discuss the March 31 Offer. Representatives from Latham reviewed with the Board certain legal aspects involved in a sale\ntransaction, including the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in assessing the March 31 Offer and a potential sale process. The Board, together with Prometheus\nmanagement and its financial and legal advisors discussed, among other things, (i) Prometheus\u2019 standalone prospects, including projected capital needs\nto advance its Phase 3 trials and its upcoming end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), (ii) the price proposed\nby Merck in the March 31 Offer, (iii) closing certainty and regulatory considerations with respect to the March 31 Offer, (iv) other potential bidders with\nthe ability to consummate a transaction at or above the value of the March 31 Offer, including the closing certainty and regulatory considerations of\npotentially transacting with any of Party W, Party X or Party Y, and (v) Prometheus\u2019 response to the March 31 Offer. At the conclusion of the discussion,\ntaking into account the topics discussed and the advice of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Centerview, the Board\nauthorized Prometheus management to reach out to Party W, Party X and Party Y to inform them that an offer to acquire Prometheus had been received\nand to gauge their level of interest in submitting an offer to acquire Prometheus on an expedited timeline. The Board selected these parties because of\ntheir prior interest in Prometheus, their perceived ability to move quickly to enter into and consummate a potential transaction based on the progress of\neach of their diligence review of Prometheus, and the Board\u2019s belief that they would be capable of making the most competitive offers due to their size\nand financial capabilities. In addition, the Board discussed and ultimately determined to formally approve the engagement of Centerview as financial\nadvisor due to its familiarity with Prometheus, its reputation as an internationally recognized investment banking firm and its substantial experience in\ntransactions similar to the Merger.\nAlso on March 31, 2023, Mr. McKenna, at the direction of the Board, spoke to representatives of Party W, Party X, and Party Y to inform them that\nan offer to acquire Prometheus had been received.\nOn April 2, 2023, the Board met again, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Latham in\nattendance, to further discuss the March 31 Offer. Representatives of Prometheus management, Centerview and Goldman Sachs reviewed and discussed\nwith the Board Prometheus management\u2019s preliminary Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, including the material assumptions included therein,\nand then representatives of each of Centerview and Goldman Sachs presented to the Board regarding selected precedent transactions, public market\nperspectives and their preliminary illustrative financial analyses. For a detailed discussion regarding the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,\nplease see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement. Following the Board\u2019s\nconsideration of the financial analyses and the preliminary Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, the Board directed management and its advisors\nto continue to engage with each of Merck, Party W, Party X and Party Y and to communicate to Merck that it would need to improve its offer. Following\nthe meeting, Mr. McKenna reached out to Mr. Patel to inform him that Prometheus was willing to provide Merck access to additional diligence materials,\nbut that Merck would need to significantly increase its offer price before Prometheus would be willing to enter into a potential strategic transaction.\nLater in the day on April 2, 2023, at the direction of the Board, Mr. McKenna spoke with representatives of Party X to encourage Party X to submit\nan offer quickly if it was interested in pursuing a potential transaction with Prometheus.\nOn April 3, 2023, Prometheus executed an engagement letter with Centerview. Also on April 3, 2023, at the direction of the Board, Mr. McKenna\nspoke with representatives of Party W to encourage Party W to submit an offer quickly if it was interested in pursuing a potential transaction with\nPrometheus.\n \n42\nTable of Contents\nOn April 4, 2023, Mr. McKenna spoke with representatives of Party Y regarding various diligence items, including Prometheus\u2019 drug candidates and\nthe overall business potential. At this meeting, Mr. McKenna encouraged Party Y to submit an offer quickly if it was interested in pursuing a potential\ntransaction with Prometheus and, following the meeting, Party Y\u2019s access to the virtual data room was restored.\nOn April 5, 2023, Mr. McKenna met in person with representatives of Party X who conveyed that they remained very interested in a potential\nstrategic transaction with Prometheus and indicated that an acquisition proposal would be submitted to Prometheus early the week of April 10.\nOn April 6, 2023, Mr. McKenna had calls with representatives of Party W to further discuss their interest in a potential transaction. During the call,\nrepresentatives of Party W confirmed that they intended to submit a formal offer.\nAlso on April 6, 2023, representatives of Prometheus management held a meeting with representatives of Party X. During the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Party X conveyed to Prometheus management that they had made significant progress on their diligence review and were focused on\nsubmitting a formal offer.\nOn April 7, 2023, Prometheus received in advance of a scheduled meeting with the FDA on April 13, 2023 initial feedback from the FDA regarding\nconclusions from the Phase 2 clinical trials for PRA023 and its future clinical development.\nAlso on April 7, 2023, representatives of Goldman Sachs had calls with representatives of Party W and Party X during which Goldman Sachs, at the\ndirection of the Board, expressed to the bidders that they would need to make competitive offers quickly and highlighted that Prometheus was focused\non all aspects of an offer, including price and the level of closing certainty, including with respect to required regulatory approvals. Following these\nconversations, Party X confirmed that they intended to make an offer.\nFrom April 6, 2023 through April 14, 2023, at Merck\u2019s and Party X\u2019s request, members of Prometheus management held numerous diligence calls\nwith representatives of Merck and Party X on topics including intellectual property, tax, clinical results and feedback, human resources, license\nagreements, finance and accounting, commercial launch and legal due diligence.\nOn April 8, 2023, Mr. McKenna spoke with representatives of Party W during which they confirmed that they intended to submit an offer on April\n12, 2023 and requested in-person meetings on April 13 and April 14, 2023.\nOn April 10, 2023, Mr. McKenna spoke with representatives of Party W, Party X and Party Y to further discuss their interest in a potential\ntransaction, to respond to certain diligence questions and to encourage each of them to make a bid expeditiously.\nAlso on April 10, 2023, the Board met, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Latham in\nattendance, to discuss the status of discussions with Merck, Party W, Party X and Party Y, including the indication from Party X that they would not be\nable to submit an offer without obtaining approval from their board of directors and the lack of indication that Party Y was likely to make a bid. During the\nmeeting, representatives of Latham again discussed with the Board their fiduciary obligations in connection with considering and approving a sale\ntransaction. Following discussion on these topics, the Board reviewed the financial advisor relationships disclosure of each of Centerview and Goldman\nSachs with respect to each of Merck, Party W and Party X. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Board authorized Prometheus management and the\nfinancial advisors to continue discussions with each party and directed them to seek the highest potential value for Prometheus stockholders.\nOn April 12, 2023, Party W submitted a non-binding letter of interest to acquire all of the outstanding Company Shares for $167.50 per share, in\ncash (the \u201cApril 12 Offer\u201d), and requested to meet in person with Prometheus management to discuss the terms of the April 12 Offer and a potential\ntransaction.\n \n43\nTable of Contents\nOn April 13 and 14, 2023, representatives of Prometheus management provided an initial draft of the Merger Agreement for review to each of\nMerck, Party W and Party X, which initial draft, among other things, (1) included seller-friendly provisions with respect to representations, warranties and\ncovenants, (2) proposed a \u201chell or high water\u201d standard for regulatory efforts with no reverse termination fee, (3) proposed a termination fee of 2.0% of\nthe enterprise value of the potential transaction and (4) did not propose an outside date for a potential transaction.\nOn April 13, 2023, members of Prometheus management attended an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss the results and conclusions\nof the Phase 2 clinical trials for PRA023 and its future clinical development, which meeting was productive. Later in the day, Prometheus management met\nwith representatives of Party W in person to discuss their April 12 Offer and Party W\u2019s continued interest in a potential acquisition of Prometheus.\nAlso on April 13, 2023, at the direction of Prometheus management, representatives of Centerview contacted representatives of Merck and Party X\nto inform them that Prometheus had received another proposal to acquire Prometheus at a significantly higher value than the March 31 Offer. Later in the\nday, representatives of Merck informed representatives of Centerview that Merck had substantially completed its diligence review and would only\ncontinue to engage with Prometheus regarding a potential acquisition if Prometheus provided specific guidance on the terms at which Prometheus would\nbe willing to enter into exclusivity with Merck and move quickly to enter into definitive transaction documents. Representatives of Merck and Mr.\nMcKenna then discussed a path to negotiate transaction documents by April 15, 2023, a transaction price of $200.00 per Company Share and Merck\u2019s\ndesire for exclusivity. Mr. McKenna agreed to discuss these topics with the Board.\nOn April 14, 2023, members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Centerview held diligence calls with\nrepresentatives of Party W and its financial advisors.\nAlso on April 14, 2023, the Board met, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Latham in attendance, to discuss the April\n12 Offer and Mr. McKenna\u2019s conversation with representatives of Merck on April 13, 2023. The Board discussed and considered, among other things, (i)\nthe offer price in the April 12 Offer, (ii) closing certainty and any regulatory approvals that would be required in connection with a potential transaction\nand, in the Board\u2019s estimation, the significantly increased antitrust risk associated with a transaction involving Party W, (iii) the merits of exclusivity and a\n$200.00 per Company Share transaction and (iv) whether other parties could provide superior offers to what Merck may agree to on the timeline\ndiscussed. The Board also discussed the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information prepared by Prometheus management. Following these\ndiscussions, the Board approved the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information and directed Prometheus management to inform Merck that\nPrometheus would agree to a transaction at $200.00 per Company Share, in cash, and that Prometheus was not willing to enter into an exclusivity\nagreement, but that Prometheus would be willing to move rapidly to negotiate transaction documents at such a price.\nLater in the day on April 14, 2023, Mr. McKenna called Mr. Patel to inform him that the Board was willing to proceed to negotiate definitive\ntransaction agreements with Merck on an expedited but non-exclusive basis with a purchase price of $200.00 per Company Share in cash. Mr. Patel\nsubsequently confirmed that Merck was willing to enter into a transaction at $200.00 per Company Share in cash, however, $200.00 per Company Share\nrepresented Merck\u2019s \u201cbest and final\u201d time-limited offer.\nLater in the day on April 14, 2023, representatives of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d), outside legal counsel to Merck,\nprovided representatives of Latham a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Latham met with Prometheus\nmanagement to discuss the key issues in the revised Merger Agreement, including, among other things, (i) the request that specified Prometheus\nstockholders execute agreements to vote in favor of the transaction at signing, (ii) the efforts required by Merck to obtain required regulatory approvals,\n(iii) whether to request from Merck a reverse break fee in connection with the potential failure to obtain required regulatory approvals and the size of any\nsuch reverse break fee, (iv) the size of the Prometheus termination fee, which Merck had proposed at 4.25% of the equity value of the potential\ntransaction, (v) the structure of the transaction as a one-step merger as proposed by Merck or a tender offer structure as proposed in the initial draft of\nthe Merger Agreement, and (vi) the appropriate Termination Date. Following discussion, Prometheus management, after consulting with members of the\nBoard, authorized\n \n44\nTable of Contents\nLatham to revise the Merger Agreement and return an updated draft to Paul Weiss that, among other things, (a) rejected Merck\u2019s request to obtain voting\nagreements from certain Prometheus stockholders, (b) accepted the efforts covenant proposed by Merck, but added a reverse break fee in connection\nwith a failure to obtain regulatory approvals, (c) reduced the size of the Prometheus termination fee from 4.25% to 3.0% of the equity value of the potential\ntransaction, (d) accepted the Merck proposal to structure the transaction as a one-step merger rather than a tender offer, and (e) proposed a Termination\nDate of 9 months following the execution of the Merger Agreement by the parties.\nLater in the evening on April 14, 2023, representatives of Latham and Paul Weiss held a call to discuss the material open issues in the Merger\nAgreement and early in the morning on April 15, 2023, Latham sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Paul Weiss reflecting the terms approved\nby Prometheus management, as well as initial drafts of certain related transaction documents.\nOn April 15, 2023, Mr. McKenna spoke to a senior representative of Party X and informed him that a transaction with another party could be\nexecuted later that day. The representative of Party X reiterated Party X\u2019s interest in Prometheus. Party X did not make an offer to acquire Prometheus.\nThroughout the day on April 15, 2023, Paul Weiss and Latham traded additional drafts of the Merger Agreement and related ancillary materials and\nnegotiated the material open points.\nLater on April 15, 2023, the Board convened along with Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Latham.\nMembers of Prometheus management reviewed with the Board the negotiations and discussions leading up to the meeting, including the timeline\nrequired by Merck to execute definitive transaction documents, the April 12 Offer, the Board\u2019s assessment, after consultation with its advisors, of the\nclosing certainty of a sale transaction with each of Merck and Party W, and the fact that Party X had not made an offer. Latham then reviewed the\nproposed final terms of the Merger Agreement with the Board as negotiated with Merck and presented to the Board regarding their fiduciary obligations\nunder Delaware law in connection with considering and approving a sale transaction. Representatives of Centerview and Goldman Sachs then reviewed\nwith the Board Centerview\u2019s and Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses of the Merger Consideration, and the Board discussed with its advisors and\nPrometheus management, among other things, the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Merger Consideration. At the request of the Board,\nrepresentatives of Centerview and Goldman Sachs then rendered to the Board oral opinions, which were subsequently confirmed by delivery of written\nopinions dated April 15, 2023, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered,\nand qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken in preparing their opinions, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company\nShares (other than as specified in such opinions) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

LLC.\u201d Executive management for Prometheus also\ninformed the Board that, based upon, among other things, their views of Prometheus\u2019 prospects on a standalone basis, their consideration of all the\nalternatives available to Prometheus and the information and advice provided by Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Latham, it was Prometheus executive\nmanagement\u2019s recommendation that the Board approve the transaction as proposed by Merck upon the terms negotiated by the parties and as set forth\nin the Merger Agreement. The Board then discussed the various reasons to approve the Merger and certain countervailing factors. For a detailed\ndescription of the various reasons considered by the Board, see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning\non page 46 of this proxy statement. After further discussion, including on the process that led to the proposed Merger, the alternatives available to\nPrometheus, including remaining as a public company, and the risks and benefits associated with the proposed transaction, the Board unanimously (i)\ndetermined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, were advisable, fair to and in the best interests\nof Prometheus and its stockholders, and declared it advisable for Prometheus to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) approved and declared advisable\nthe execution and delivery by Prometheus of the Merger Agreement, the performance by Prometheus of its covenants and agreements contained in the\nMerger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement upon the terms and subject\nto the\n \n45\nTable of Contents\nconditions contained therein, (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders and (iv)\nresolved, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement at\nsuch meeting of Prometheus\u2019 stockholders.\nImmediately following the conclusion of the Board meeting, Latham and Paul Weiss finalized all transaction documents and Prometheus, Merck,\nand Merger Sub executed the Merger Agreement.\nOn April 16, 2023, Merck and Prometheus issued a joint press release announcing the entry into the Merger Agreement.\nRecommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger",

            "text": "Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Board\nThe Board has unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are\nadvisable, fair to and in the best interests of Prometheus and its stockholders, and declared it advisable for Prometheus to enter into the Merger\nAgreement\u037e (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution and delivery by Prometheus of the Merger Agreement, the performance by Prometheus of\nits covenants and agreements contained therein and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby upon the terms\nand subject to the conditions contained therein\u037e (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote at a special meeting of\nthe holders of Company Shares\u037e and (iv) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the Merger\nAgreement be adopted by Prometheus stockholders.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that Prometheus stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Compensation\nProposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Board consulted with members of Prometheus\u2019 senior\nmanagement, representatives of Prometheus\u2019 legal advisor, Latham & Watkins LLP, and representatives of Prometheus\u2019 financial advisors, Centerview and\nGoldman Sachs. In the course of reaching its determination and recommendation, the Board reviewed, evaluated and considered a significant amount of\ninformation and numerous factors and benefits, including those listed below (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which the\nBoard viewed as supporting its (i) determination that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are\nadvisable, fair to and in the best interests of Prometheus and its stockholders and its direction that Prometheus enter into the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii)\napproval and declaration that it is advisable for Prometheus to execute and deliver the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) direction that the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement be submitted to a vote of Prometheus\u2019 stockholders at the Special Meeting\u037e and (iv) resolution, subject to the terms and conditions set forth\nin the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Prometheus\u2019 stockholders:\n \n\u2022\nPremium to Market Price. The Board considered the relationship of the Merger Consideration to the price of the Company Shares\nimmediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement and the recent historical market price and volatility of the Company Shares,\nincluding the fact that the Merger Consideration represents (i) a premium of approximately 75% to the $114.01 closing price per Company\nShare on Nasdaq on April 14, 2023, the last trading day prior to the date on which the Merger Agreement was executed\u037e (ii) a premium of\napproximately 75% to the trailing volume-weighted average price per share of $114.33 for the thirty (30) trading day period ended April 14,\n2023\u037e (iii) a premium of approximately 58% to the 52-week high closing trading price per share of $126.29 for the 52-week period ended April\n14, 2023\u037e (iv) a premium of approximately 82% to the price per share of $110.00 at which Prometheus last raised capital on December 8, 2022\u037e\nand (v) a premium of approximately 953% to the price per share of $19.00 at which Prometheus issued Company Shares in its initial public\noffering on March 16, 2021. The Board believed that the Merger\n \n46Table of Contents\nConsideration represents the highest value reasonably available for the Company Shares for the foreseeable future, taking into account the\nBoard\u2019s familiarity with the business strategy, assets and prospects of Prometheus and the recent historical market price of the Company\nShares.\n \n\u2022\nCertainty of Value. The Board considered the all-cash nature of the Merger Consideration to be received by Prometheus\u2019 stockholders in\nthe Merger, which would provide liquidity and certainty of value to our stockholders while avoiding exposure to Prometheus\u2019 clinical,\nregulatory, commercialization and other business risks. Taking into account the business, operations, prospects, strategic and short and\nlong term operating plans, assets, liabilities and financial condition of Prometheus, the Board weighed the certainty of realizing compelling\nvalue for Company Shares by virtue of the Merger against the uncertain prospect that the trading value of Company Shares would\napproach the Merger Consideration in the foreseeable future and the risks and uncertainties associated with our business generally,\nincluding those described below and those discussed in Prometheus\u2019 public filings with the SEC. See \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation\u201d beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement.\n \n\u2022\nPossible Strategic Alternatives. The Board considered the process conducted by Prometheus, with the assistance of representatives of\nCenterview and Goldman Sachs, to identify whether other potential parties might be interested in pursuing an acquisition of Prometheus,\ntaking into account the expected interest of such parties generally, their financial capability to consummate a transaction of this size, their\nability to provide deal certainty, and their ability to move expeditiously and efficiently to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an\nacquisition of Prometheus and consummate such transaction. After a thorough review of strategic alternatives and discussions with\nmanagement and Prometheus\u2019 financial and legal advisors, the Board determined that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to\nPrometheus stockholders than the potential value that might result from other strategic options available, including, but not limited to,\nremaining a standalone public company.\n \n\u2022\nFull and Fair Value. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration of $200.00 per Company Share represents full and fair value for our\nCompany Shares, taking into account the Board\u2019s familiarity with the business strategy, assets and prospects of Prometheus on a\nstandalone basis and the relative certainty of the cash consideration payable in the Merger as compared to the risks and uncertainties of\ncontinuing on a standalone basis as an independent public company.\n \n\u2022\nHighest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration of $200.00 per Company Share represents the\nhighest value reasonably obtainable for our Company Shares for the foreseeable future, taking into account the business, operations,\nprospects, business strategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of Prometheus. The Board also considered the progress and\nthe outcome of Prometheus\u2019 negotiations with Merck, including the increase in the consideration offered by Merck from the time of its initial\nexpression of interest to the end of the negotiations, a number of changes in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement from the\nversion initially proposed by Merck that were favorable to Prometheus, Merck\u2019s communications that its offer would be withdrawn if an\nagreement was not reached expeditiously, and the fact that a number of other strategic parties that had been contacted with respect to a\npotential acquisition of Prometheus had determined not to engage with Prometheus, had determined that they would not be capable of\nentering into a strategic transaction with Prometheus at such time, or had otherwise failed to submit a proposal that the Board considered\ncompelling relative to the terms of the Merger and the Merger Consideration of $200.00 per Company Share. Further, the Board believed,\nbased on these negotiations, that the Merger Consideration was the highest price per share that Merck was willing to pay and that the\nMerger Agreement contained the most favorable terms to Prometheus to which Merck was willing to agree.\n \n\u2022\nProduct Commercialization and Development Risks. The Board considered the fact that Prometheus has limited marketing, sales and\ndistribution experience and capabilities, and, if Prometheus\u2019 product candidates receive regulatory approval, Prometheus would need to\ndevelop or access such capabilities\n \n47\nTable of Contents\nwithin the United States and globally, which it may fail to do successfully or at reasonable cost, along with the risks related to market\nacceptance and other factors affecting the revenues and profitability of product candidates generally.\n \n\u2022\nLikelihood of Consummation. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, including the likelihood of consummation, based upon the scope of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger,\nthe relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, the remedies available to Prometheus under the Merger Agreement in the\nevent of various breaches by Merck, including specific performance, and Merck\u2019s reputation in the biopharmaceutical industry and its\nfinancial capacity to complete an acquisition of this size, which the Board believed supported the conclusion that a transaction with Merck\ncould be completed relatively expeditiously and in an orderly manner.\n \n\u2022\nCenterview\u2019s and Goldman Sachs\u2019 Respective Opinions and Related Analyses. The Board considered the opinions of Centerview and\nGoldman Sachs rendered to the Board on April 15, 2023, which were subsequently confirmed by delivery of written opinions dated such\ndate that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and\nqualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview and Goldman Sachs in preparing their respective opinions, the\nMerger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Shares (other than as specified in such opinions) pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below under the captions \u201cOpinion of\nCenterview Partners LLC\u201d and \u201cOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.\u201d\n \n\u2022\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which was the product of arm\u2019s-\nlength negotiations with the assistance of Prometheus\u2019 advisors, including the structure of the transaction, the all-cash form of the Merger\nConsideration, the limited scope of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, and the customary nature of the representations,\nwarranties, and the covenants and agreements of the parties. For the reasons noted below, the Board believed that the provisions of the\nMerger Agreement were advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Prometheus and our stockholders. In particular:\n \n\u2022\nNo Financing Condition. The Board considered the representation of Merck that Merck would have available sufficient funds for the\nsatisfaction of all of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses required to be paid by\nMerck or Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and that the consummation of the Merger is not subject to a\nfinancing condition.\n \n\u2022\nNo Solicitation Covenants and Fiduciary Outs. The Board considered the non-solicitation covenants and \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provisions\nof the Merger Agreement, which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof and limitations set forth therein, permit Prometheus to\nfurnish information to, and to engage in discussions with, third parties that make unsolicited Acquisition Proposals meeting certain\ncriteria, permit the Board to change its recommendation to stockholders regarding the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances\nand permit Prometheus to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a Superior Proposal,\nsubject to, among other things, payment of a termination fee to Merck. The Board further considered its ability to change its\nrecommendation to stockholders regarding the Merger Agreement in response to an Intervening Event if the failure to do so would\nreasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board under applicable law. The Board further considered\nthe fact that the Prometheus Termination Fee, in the opinion of the Board, (i) is reasonable in light of the overall terms of the Merger\nAgreement and the benefits of the Merger, (ii) is consistent with the amount of such fees payable in comparable transactions on a\nrelative basis, (iii) would not be a substantial impediment or preclude another party from making a competing proposal to acquire\nPrometheus, and (iv) fair in light of the Merck Termination Fee in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to\neffect the Merger prior to the\n \n48\nTable of Contents\nTermination Date because of an inability to obtain the necessary competition approvals or due to the entry of a final, non-appealable\nantitrust law or order permanently restraining, enjoining, preventing, or prohibiting or making illegal the Merger.\n \n\u2022\nTermination Date. The Board considered the fact that the Termination Date under the Merger Agreement, on which either party,\nsubject to certain exceptions, can terminate the Merger Agreement, allows for sufficient time to consummate the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, but also prevents the Merger Agreement from being extended for an unreasonable amount\nof time, which could adversely impact operations.\n \n\u2022\nEnforcement. The Board considered Prometheus\u2019 ability to obtain specific enforcement of the obligations of Merck and Merger Sub\nunder the Merger Agreement, thereby ensuring that Prometheus has an appropriate remedy in the event Merck and Merger Sub were\nto decline to comply with their obligations under the Merger Agreement.\n \n\u2022\nStockholder Approval\u037e Appraisal Rights. The Board considered that the adoption of the Merger Agreement would be subject to the\napproval of our stockholders, that stockholders would be free to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and that\nstockholders who do not vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law\nwill be entitled to such appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.\n \n\u2022\nConditions to Closing\u037e Interim Operations. The Board considered the fact that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement\nminimize, to the extent reasonably practical, the risk that a condition to consummation of the Merger would not be satisfied and also\nprovide reasonable flexibility to operate Prometheus\u2019 business during the pendency of the Merger.\nThe Board, in consultation with members of Prometheus\u2019 senior management, also assessed Prometheus\u2019 prospects for substantially increasing\nstockholder value as a standalone company in excess of the Merger Consideration given the risks and uncertainties in Prometheus\u2019 business, including,\nbut not limited to, the following (which are not listed in any relative order of importance) and those discussed in Prometheus\u2019 public filings with the SEC\n(see \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement):\n \n\u2022\nPrometheus\u2019 approach to the discovery and development of precision medicines based on Prometheus\u2019 Prometheus360TM platform is\nunproven, and Prometheus does not know whether it will be able to develop any therapeutics or diagnostic products of commercial value,\nor if competing technological approaches will limit the commercial value of its product candidates and diagnostic candidates or render\nPrometheus360 obsolete.\n \n\u2022\nPrometheus\u2019 Enroll360TM platform is also unproven, and Prometheus does not know whether enrolling and profiling patients into Enroll360\nwill translate into any improvement over traditionally slow enrollment rates or ability to enroll patients into future biomarker-guided clinical\ntrials who are more likely to respond to Prometheus\u2019 therapeutic candidates.\n \n\u2022\nPrometheus is early in its development efforts and all of its development programs are in the clinical, preclinical or discovery stage and if\nPrometheus is unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize product candidates and related\ndiagnostic candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, Prometheus\u2019 business will be materially harmed.\n \n\u2022\nPreclinical and clinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and the results of preclinical\nstudies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results and Prometheus\u2019 product candidates may not have favorable\nresults in clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all.\n \n\u2022\nAny difficulties or delays in the commencement or completion, or termination or suspension, of Prometheus\u2019 ongoing or planned clinical\ntrials, including as a result of Prometheus never having\n \n49\nTable of Contents\ncompleted a Phase 3 registrational program, could result in increased costs to Prometheus, delay or limit Prometheus\u2019 ability to generate\nrevenue and adversely affect Prometheus\u2019 commercial prospects.\n \n\u2022\nPrometheus\u2019 limited operating history, the fact that Prometheus has incurred significant operating losses since its inception and expects to\nincur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and the fact that Prometheus may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve\nand maintain profitability.\n \n\u2022\nIn the near term, Prometheus\u2019 ability to generate revenue will depend primarily on collaboration revenue.\n \n\u2022\nPrometheus has entered into, and may in the future seek to enter into, collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements and may not\nbe successful in doing so, and even if successful, Prometheus may relinquish valuable rights and may not realize the benefits of such\nrelationships.\n \n\u2022\nPrometheus relies on third parties to conduct many of its preclinical studies and clinical trials and to manufacture its product candidates,\nand these third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\n \n\u2022\nPrometheus faces significant competition, and if Prometheus\u2019 competitors develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than\nPrometheus does or their technologies or product candidates are more effective, Prometheus\u2019 ability to develop and successfully\ncommercialize products may be adversely affected.\n \n\u2022\nIf Prometheus is unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for its therapeutic and diagnostic programs, products and other proprietary\ntechnologies it may develop, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, Prometheus\u2019 competitors could\ndevelop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to Prometheus\u2019, and Prometheus\u2019 ability to successfully\ncommercialize its therapeutic and diagnostic programs, products and other proprietary technologies it may develop may be adversely\naffected.\n \n\u2022\nPrometheus may not be able to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.\n \n\u2022\nPrometheus depends on intellectual property licensed from third parties, and its licensors may not always act in Prometheus\u2019 best interests.\n \n\u2022\nIf Prometheus fails to comply with its obligations under its intellectual property licenses, if the licenses are terminated or if disputes\nregarding these licenses arise, Prometheus could lose significant rights that are important to its business.\n \n\u2022\nPrometheus will require substantial additional financing to achieve its goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on\nacceptable terms, or at all, could force Prometheus to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its development programs, commercialization efforts or\nother operations.\n \n\u2022\nThe current state of the U.S. and global economies, including the recent downward trend in the biopharmaceutical financial markets,\nincreased volatility resulting from escalating political and global trade tensions, and the current and potential impact in both the near term\nand long term on the biopharmaceutical industry and the future commercialization efforts required with respect to Prometheus\u2019 therapeutic\nand diagnostic products or product candidates that may become approved for sale, including the numerous risks, costs and uncertainties\nassociated with research, development and commercialization of Prometheus\u2019 pipeline programs.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Board, in consultation with members of Prometheus\u2019 senior management and representatives of Prometheus\u2019\noutside financial and legal advisors, also considered a variety of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (which are not listed in any relative\norder of importance):\n \n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Earnings or Growth. The Board considered that the nature of the Merger as a cash transaction\nmeans that, if the Merger is consummated, our stockholders will not participate in future earnings or growth of Prometheus and will not\nbenefit from any appreciation in the value of Prometheus\u2019 business, the success of any of Prometheus\u2019 product candidates or any\nappreciation in the shares of the surviving corporation.\n \n50\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, including the Merger, might not be consummated, and that consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of\ncertain conditions that may not be within our control, including receipt of the necessary regulatory clearances and approvals and that no\nCompany Material Adverse Effect with respect to Prometheus has occurred that is continuing. The Board considered the fact that there can\nbe no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied and, as a result, it is possible that\nthe Merger may not be consummated even if the Merger Agreement is adopted by our stockholders. The Board considered the fact that if\nthe Merger is not consummated (i) Prometheus will have incurred significant transaction and opportunity costs, including the possibility of\ndisruption to our operations, diversion of management and employee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our\nbusiness relationships, (ii) the trading price of the Company Shares may be adversely affected, and (iii) the market\u2019s perceptions of our\nprospects could be adversely affected.\n \n\u2022\nInterim Operating Covenants. The Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of our business during the pendency of the Merger,\nwhich may delay or prevent Prometheus from undertaking potential business opportunities that may arise, may have a material adverse\neffect on our ability to respond to changing market and business conditions in a timely manner (or at all), or may negatively affect our ability\nto attract, retain and motivate key personnel. The Board also considered that the focus and resources of Prometheus\u2019 management may\nbecome diverted from other important business opportunities and operational matters while working to consummate the Merger, which\ncould adversely affect our business.\n \n\u2022\nNo Solicitation Covenants and Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that, subject to certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement\nprecludes Prometheus and its representatives from soliciting, or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations relating to,\nalternative acquisition proposals, and requires Prometheus to pay to Merck the Prometheus Termination Fee if the Merger Agreement is\nterminated under certain circumstances, including a termination of the Merger Agreement by Prometheus to enter into a definitive\nagreement for a Superior Proposal, as described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee\u037e Certain Expenses\u201d beginning on page 100 of\nthis proxy statement. The Board also considered, but did not consider preclusive, the fact that the right afforded to Merck under the Merger\nAgreement to propose amendments or modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in response to a Superior\nProposal may discourage other parties that might otherwise have an interest in a business combination with, or an acquisition of,\nPrometheus. The Board also considered that the amount of the termination fee, as compared to termination fees in transactions of a similar\nsize, in the opinion of the Board, was reasonable and would not likely deter competing bids. The Board also recognized that the provisions\nin the Merger Agreement relating to non-solicitation and the termination fee were required by Merck as conditions to entering into the\nMerger Agreement.\n \n\u2022\nEffect of Transaction Announcement. The Board considered the potential effect of the announcement of the Merger Agreement, including\neffects on our stock price and operations, including our relationships with suppliers, distributors, vendors, collaborators and employees,\nand our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well\nas the possibility of a suit, action or proceeding in respect of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.\n \n\u2022\nTransaction Costs. The Board considered the fact that we have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and\nexpenses in connection with the Merger, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.\n \n\u2022\nTaxable Transaction. The Board considered that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to our stockholders that are\ntreated as U.S. Holders (as defined in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Holders of\nCompany Shares\u201d beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement) for United States federal income tax purposes.\n \n51\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nInterests of Directors and Executive Officers. The Board considered the possibility that Prometheus\u2019 directors and executive officers may\nhave interests in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Prometheus\u2019\nstockholders generally. See \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Prometheus in the Merger\u201d beginning on\npage 64 of this proxy statement.\nAfter considering the foregoing potentially negative factors, the Board concluded that the potential benefits of the Merger substantially\noutweighed the risks or potential negative consequences.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive, but includes the\nmaterial reasons and factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions and recommendation in relation to the Merger, the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions proposed thereby. In light of the variety of reasons and factors considered and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not\nfind it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons or factors considered in reaching their\ndeterminations and recommendations. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including thorough discussions\nwith, and questioning of, members of our senior management and representatives of our outside financial advisors and legal counsel. Individual directors\nmay have given differing weights to different factors or may have had different reasons for their ultimate determination. In addition, the Board did not\nreach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered. Instead, the Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors\nand reasons described above and determined in its business judgment that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits of the Merger to the stockholders of\nPrometheus outweighed the risks or potential negative consequences. It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain\ninformation presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 36 of this proxy statement.",

The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by,\nand underlying the opinion of, Centerview, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to\nthose financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so the\nreference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized below should not be taken to be Centerview\u2019s view of the actual\nvalue of Prometheus. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully\nunderstand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete\ndescription of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the tables below without considering all financial analyses or\nfactors or the full narrative description of such analyses or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors,\ncould create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview\u2019s financial analyses and its opinion. In performing its analyses,\nCenterview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of\nwhich are beyond the control of Prometheus or any other parties to the Merger. None of Prometheus, Merck, Merger Sub or Centerview or any other\nperson assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below.\nIn addition, analyses relating to the value of Prometheus do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which Prometheus may actually be\n \n54\nTable of Contents\nsold. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to substantial\nuncertainty. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it\nexisted on or before April 14, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger) and is not necessarily indicative of current market\nconditions.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis \nCenterview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Prometheus based on the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. A discounted\ncash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset or set of assets by calculating the \u201cpresent value\u201d of\nestimated future cash flows of the asset or set of assets. \u201cPresent value\u201d refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by\ndiscounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the\nopportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.\nIn performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range of per Company Share equity values by (a) discounting to present value as of March 31,\n2023 using discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 13.5% (reflecting Centerview\u2019s analysis of Prometheus\u2019 weighted average cost of capital) and using a\nmid-year convention: (i) the forecasted risk-adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows of Prometheus over the period beginning April 1, 2023 and\nending on December 31, 2044, utilized by Centerview as set forth in Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, (ii) an implied terminal value of\nPrometheus, calculated by Centerview by assuming that unlevered free cash flows would decline in perpetuity after December 31, 2044 at a rate of free\ncash flow decline of 50% year over year (except for platform, overhead general and administrative and unallocated research and development), (iii) tax\nsavings from usage of Prometheus\u2019 estimated federal net operating losses of approximately $164 million as of December 31, 2022 and future losses, as\nreflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, (b) adding to the foregoing results Prometheus\u2019 net estimated cash and cash equivalents of\n$715 million as of March 31, 2023, as provided by Prometheus management, and (c) subtracting from the foregoing results the present value of the impact\nof assumed equity raises of $500 million in 2025 and $400 million in 2026, as set forth in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. Centerview\ndivided the result of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully diluted outstanding Company Shares (determined using the treasury stock method\nand taking into account the dilutive impact of outstanding in-the-money options and restricted stock units) as of April 13, 2023, based on the Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information, resulting in a range of implied equity values per Company Share of $128.60 to $152.35 rounded to the nearest $0.05.\nCenterview then compared the results of the above analysis to the $200.00 per Company Share value of the Merger Consideration to be paid to the\nholders of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nOther Factors\nCenterview noted for the Board certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:\n \n\u2022\nHistorical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed historical closing trading prices of the Company Shares during the 52-week\nperiod ended April 14, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger), which reflected low and high stock closing\nprices for Prometheus during such period of approximately $22.39 to $126.29 per Company Share, rounded to the nearest $0.01.\n \n\u2022\nAnalyst Price Target Analysis. Centerview reviewed stock price targets for the Company Shares in recently published, publicly available\nWall Street research analyst reports as of April 14, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger), which\nindicated low and high stock price targets for Prometheus ranging from $138.00 to $225.00 per Company Share.\n \n55\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nPremiums Paid Analysis. Centerview performed an analysis of premiums paid in selected transactions involving publicly traded\nbiopharmaceutical companies for which premium data were available. The premiums in this analysis were calculated by comparing the per\nshare acquisition price in each transaction (excluding any contingent consideration) to the closing price of the target company\u2019s common\nstock for the date one day prior to the date on which the trading price of the target\u2019s common stock was perceived to be affected by a\npotential transaction. Based on such analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment,\nCenterview applied a range of 50% to 80% to Prometheus\u2019 closing stock price on April 14, 2023 (the last trading day before the public\nannouncement of the Merger) of $114.01, which resulted in an implied price range of approximately $171.00 to $205.20 per Company Share,\nrounded to the nearest $0.05.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant\nmethods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily\nsusceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or\nanalysis that it considered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after\nconsidering the results of all of the analyses.\nCenterview\u2019s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in its evaluation of the Merger.\nConsequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or Prometheus Management with respect\nto the Merger Consideration or as to whether the Board would have been willing to determine that a different consideration was fair. The consideration\nfor the transaction was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Prometheus and Merck and was approved by the Board. Centerview\nprovided advice to Prometheus during these negotiations. Centerview did not, however recommend any specific amount of consideration to Prometheus\nor the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transaction.\nCenterview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory\nand merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, except for Centerview\u2019s current engagement, Centerview had not\nbeen engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Prometheus, and Centerview did not receive any compensation from Prometheus during\nsuch period. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview provided financial advisory services unrelated to Prometheus, to Merck,\nincluding in connection with Merck\u2019s spin-off of Organon & Co. in 2021 and other strategic matters, and Centerview received between $15 million and $25\nmillion in aggregate compensation from Merck during such period. Centerview may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to\nPrometheus or Merck or their respective affiliates in the future, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview\u2019s affiliates or related investment funds and\n(iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time\nacquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or\ninvestments in, Prometheus, Merck or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the Merger.\nThe Board selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger based on Centerview\u2019s familiarity with Prometheus, their\nreputation as an internationally recognized investment banking firm and their substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Centerview is\nan internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger.\nIn connection with Centerview\u2019s services as the financial advisor to the Board, Prometheus has agreed to pay Centerview an aggregate fee of $70.5\nmillion, $2.0 million of which was payable upon the earlier to occur of\n \n56\nTable of Contents\n(i) the date on which Centerview advised the Board that it was prepared to render its opinion and (ii) the rendering of the opinion and $68.5 million of\nwhich is payable contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Prometheus has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview\u2019s expenses\narising, and to indemnify Centerview against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Centerview\u2019s engagement.\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.

In that regard, Goldman Sachs\nassumed with Prometheus\u2019 consent that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then\ncurrently available estimates and judgments of the management of Prometheus. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of\nthe assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Prometheus and it was not furnished\nwith any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the\nconsummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs also assumed that the Merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of\nany term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Prometheus to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the\nMerger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Prometheus\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting\nmatters. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of Company\nShares, as of the date of the opinion, of the $200.00 in cash per Company Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Except as otherwise noted,\nthe following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before April 14, 2023, the\nlast trading day before the public announcement of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nImplied Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia described below based on the consideration to be paid to\nholders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n \n58\nTable of Contents\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the consideration to be paid to holders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of\nCompany Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement relative to:\n \n\u2022\n$114.01, the closing price per Company Share as of April 14, 2023 (which is referred to in this section of the proxy statement as the\n\u201cUnaffected Share Price\u201d)\u037e\n \n\u2022\n$129.60, the highest intra-day trading price of Company Shares over the 52-week period ended April 14, 2023 (which is referred to in this\nsection of the proxy statement as the \u201c52-week High\u201d)\u037e and\n \n\u2022\n$114.33, the volume weighted average price (which is referred to in this section of the proxy statement as \u201cVWAP\u201d) of Company Shares over\nthe 30-trading-day time period ended April 14, 2023 (which is referred to in this section of the proxy statement as the \u201c30-day VWAP\u201d).\nThe results of these calculations and comparisons were as follows:\n \nCommon Stock Reference Price\nImplied\nPremium\nRepresented\nby\n$200.00 in\nCash per\nCompany\nShare\nUnaffected Share Price of $114.01\n75.4%\n52-week High of $129.60\n54.3%\n30-day VWAP of $114.33\n74.9%\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative\ndiscounted cash flow analysis on Prometheus to derive a range of illustrative present values per Company Share. Using the mid-year convention for\ndiscounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting estimates of Prometheus\u2019 weighted average cost of capital (\u201cWACC\u201d),\nGoldman Sachs discounted to present value as of March 31, 2023 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Prometheus for the second, third and fourth\nquarters of fiscal year 2023 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2044 as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information and (ii) a\nrange of illustrative terminal values for Prometheus, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 2.0% to a terminal\nyear estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by Prometheus, as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. In addition,\nusing a mid-year convention and discount rate of 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting an estimate of Prometheus\u2019 WACC, Goldman Sachs discounted to present\nvalue as of March 31, 2023 the estimated benefits of Prometheus\u2019 net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year\n2023 through fiscal year 2044 as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by\nGoldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information and market\nexpectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the\nCapital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Prometheus\u2019 target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-\nterm debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Prometheus, as well as certain financial\nmetrics for the United States financial markets generally.\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Prometheus by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman\nSachs then added to the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived, the amount of Prometheus\u2019 net cash balance as of March 31, 2023, and the net\npresent value of the $500 million in financing with a 6% gross spread expected in 2025 and $400 million in financing with a 6% gross spread expected in\n2026, as set forth in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information and in each case, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the\nmanagement of Prometheus, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Prometheus. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity\nvalues it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding Company Shares, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management\nof Prometheus, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per Company Share ranging from $129.78 to $161.59.\n \n59\nTable of Contents\nPremia Paid Analysis\u2014Undisturbed Closing Stock Price. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the\nacquisition premia for select transactions announced in the 10 years preceding April 14, 2023 involving a public company in the biopharmaceutical\nindustry based in the United States as the target where the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were between $5 billion and $15 billion. For the\nentire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in\nthe 23 transactions relative to the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median\npremium of 62% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 48% and 75th percentile premium of 77% across the period.\nUsing this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 48% to 77% to the undisturbed closing price per Company Share\nof $114.01 as of April 14, 2021 and calculated a range of implied equity values per Company Share of $168.51 to $201.57.\nPremia Paid Analysis\u201452-Week Intraday High Stock Price. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the\nacquisition premia for select transactions announced in the 10 years preceding April 14, 2023 involving a public company in the biopharmaceutical\nindustry based in the United States as the target where the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were between $5 billion and $15 billion.

This analysis indicated a median\npremium of 28% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 19% and 75th percentile premium of 56% across the period.\nUsing this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 19% to 56% to the 52-week intraday high per Company Share of\n$129.60 as of April 14, 2021 and calculated a range of implied equity values per Company Share of $154.28 to $202.51.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and\ndid not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis\nof its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a\ncomparison is directly comparable to Prometheus or Merck or the contemplated transaction.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Board as to the fairness from a financial point\nof view of the $200.00 in cash per Company Share to be paid to the holders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of Company Shares pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually\nmay be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or\nless favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Prometheus, Merck, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes\nresponsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Prometheus and Merck and was approved by the Board.\nGoldman Sachs provided advice to Prometheus during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of\nconsideration to Prometheus or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nAs described herein, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in making its\ndetermination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not\n \n60\nTable of Contents\npurport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,\ninvestment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates\nand employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at\nany time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default\nswaps and other financial instruments of Prometheus, Merck any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be\ninvolved in the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Prometheus in connection with, and\nparticipated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain\nfinancial advisory and/or underwriting services to Prometheus and its affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has\nreceived, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as acted as bookrunner to Prometheus in connection to a follow-on equity raise in\nDecember 2022. During the two-year period ended April 15, 2023, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting\nservices provided by Goldman Sachs Investment Banking to Prometheus and/or its affiliates of approximately $13 million. Goldman Sachs also has\nprovided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Merck and its affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment\nBanking has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Merck in connection to its acquisition of Acceleron\nPharma Inc. in November 2021, as joint bookrunner to Merck with respect to its offering of certain notes in December 2021, as joint lead arranger and joint\nbookrunner to Organon & Co., a subsidiary of Merck, with respect to its offering of certain term loans and other secured and unsecured debt in June\n2021, and as letter of credit issuer to Organon & Co. in connection to a revolving credit facility in June 2021. During the two-year period ended April 15,\n2023, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by Goldman Sachs Investment Banking\nto Merck and/or its affiliates of approximately $32 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services\nto Prometheus, Merck and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking may receive compensation.\nThe Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial\nexperience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated September 27, 2022 (as amended), Prometheus engaged Goldman\nSachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the contemplated transaction. The engagement letter between Prometheus and Goldman Sachs\nprovides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $70.5 million, $1\nmillion of which became payable at announcement of the Merger, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In\naddition, Prometheus has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify\nGoldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities that may arise out of its engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities\nlaws.\nCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information",

            "text": "Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nWe do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to our future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty,\nunpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates and the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future\nperiods. However, Prometheus\u2019 management regularly prepares and reviews with the Board estimates regarding the success and timing of the\ndevelopment of, regulatory filings and approvals for and the commercialization of our products and product candidates. In connection with our strategic\nplanning process and the Board\u2019s evaluation of the Merger, as described further in the section captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 39 of this proxy statement, Prometheus\u2019 management prepared and reviewed with the Board certain unaudited prospective financial\ninformation of Prometheus as an independent company for the fiscal years 2023 through 2044, as prepared and used as described below (referred to as\nthe \u201cUnaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d).\n \n61Table of Contents\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and was provided to the Board\nfor the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the Merger. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was also provided to, approved\nby Prometheus for use by, and relied upon by, Centerview and Goldman Sachs, Prometheus\u2019 financial advisors, for the purposes of Centerview\u2019s and\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s financial analyses and fairness opinions in connection with the Merger (as described in more detail in the sections captioned \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC\u201d and \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d beginning on pages 52 and 57 of this proxy\nstatement, respectively), and were the only financial projections with respect to the Company used by Centerview and Goldman Sachs in performing such\nfinancial analyses. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not provided to Merck or any other prospective bidder. The Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information includes estimates of Prometheus\u2019 financial performance on a risk-adjusted basis. With Prometheus\u2019 consent,\nCenterview and Goldman Sachs each assumed that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the\nbest then available estimates and judgments of our management as to our future financial performance, and relied on Prometheus\u2019 assessments as to the\nvalidity of, and risks associated with, our products and product candidates.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed based on Prometheus\u2019 management\u2019s knowledge of and assumptions with respect\nto Prometheus\u2019 business, including with respect to the commercialization of Prometheus\u2019 PRA023 pipeline drug candidate for the treatment of immune-\nmediated diseases including ulcerative colitis (\u201cUC\u201d), Crohn\u2019s Disease, and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease and Prometheus\u2019\nPRA052 pipeline drug candidate for the treatment of UC. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed without giving effect to the\nMerger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, the expenses that have already or may be incurred\nin connection with completing the Merger or any changes to Prometheus\u2019 operations or strategy that may be implemented during the pendency of or\nfollowing the consummation of the Merger. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the\nMerger to be completed and it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d). In addition, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared\nwith a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to\nprospective financial information. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have (1) compiled,\nreviewed, audited, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, (2) expressed any opinion or\nany other form of assurance on such information or the achievability of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information or (3) assumed any\nresponsibility for the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\nBecause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to sensitivities and assumptions, as\nwell as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also covers\nmultiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nis not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not fact\nand should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our future results.\nAlthough the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates\nas to future events. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to achieve our goals for the\ndevelopment, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates, including on the timeline assumed for purposes of the\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects assumptions and uncertainties that are subject to\nchange. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information not to be achieved are described in\n \n62\nTable of Contents\nvarious risk factors described in the section captioned \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 36 of this\nproxy statement, and in our other filings with the SEC, including those listed under the section captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d\nbeginning on page 114 of this proxy statement. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of our control. As a result, there\ncan be no assurance that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those\ncontained in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, whether or not the Merger is consummated. The Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation also reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information may\ndiffer from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and does not consider any events or circumstances after the date that it was prepared, including the\nannouncement of the entry into the Merger Agreement. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information has not been updated or revised to reflect\ninformation or results after the date it was prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities\nlaws, we do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that\nsuch information was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events. Prometheus has or may report results of operations for periods included in\nthe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information that were or will be completed following the preparation of the Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation. Stockholders and investors are urged to refer to Prometheus\u2019 periodic filings with the SEC for information on Prometheus\u2019 actual historical\nresults.\nCertain of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information are \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures.\u201d These are\nfinancial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a\nsubstitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are\nlimitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation.\nIn certain circumstances, including those applicable to the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, financial measures included in forecasts\nprovided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business combination transaction are excluded from the definition of \u201cnon-\nGAAP financial measures\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not subject to SEC\nrules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP\nfinancial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Board, Centerview or Goldman Sachs.\nAccordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is provided in this proxy statement.\nThe Unaudited Prospective Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. By including the Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation in this proxy statement, neither we nor any of our representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding our ultimate\nperformance as compared to the information contained in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, Prometheus or any other person considered, or now considers, the\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information to be predictive of actual future results. Further, the inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Prometheus that the information presented is material. The\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information is included in this proxy statement solely to give our stockholders access to the information that was\nprovided to the Board, Centerview, and Goldman Sachs. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not included in this proxy statement in order\nto influence any Prometheus stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights\nwith respect to their shares.\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information\nVarious judgments and assumptions were made when preparing the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, including, among others (1)\nrevenue estimates based on various assumptions, including with respect\n \n63\nTable of Contents\nto addressable patient population, United States and EU commercial launch years, market penetration, time to peak sales, peak sales, inflationary factors\nand pricing and exclusivity, and potential outcomes with respect thereto for the commercialization of the PRA023, PRA052 and other potential pipeline\ndrug candidates, (2) the probability of success in obtaining regulatory approval of Prometheus\u2019 drug candidates, (3) the entry into partnerships for the\ndevelopment and commercialization of certain product candidates outside of the United States and EU with various upfront, milestone and royalty\npayments assumptions, (4) assumptions with respect to cost of goods sold and estimated sales, marketing and distribution expenses, with certain of such\nassumptions estimated on a product-by-product basis, (5) estimated royalty and milestone expenses payable by and to Prometheus based on the terms of\nPrometheus\u2019 existing and future potential partner relationships, (6) variable research and development expenses estimated based on the phase of each\nproduct\u2019s development and launch, (7) estimated benefits of Prometheus\u2019 net operating losses of approximately $164 million as of December 31, 2022 and\nestimated future losses, (8) the impact of $500 million in financing expected in 2025 and $400 million in financing expected in 2026, and (9) corporate\ngeneral and administrative expenses generally.\nThe following table presents estimates of Prometheus\u2019 net revenue, gross profit, EBIT, net income and unlevered free cash flow, in each case, for\nthe fiscal years 2023 through 2044, as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, as approved by Prometheus management.\nProjected Non-GAAP \n($ in millions, Unaudited)\n \nFiscal Year Ending December 31,\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\nNet Revenue\n$\n4\n\u2014\n$\n100\n$\n158\n$\n403\n$\n848\n$1,770\n$2,948\n$4,233\n$5,640\n$6,300\nGross Profit\n$\n4\n\u2014\n$\n100\n$\n145\n$\n367\n$\n772\n$1,609\n$2,676\n$3,836\n$5,105\n$5,691\nEBIT(1)\n$ (209)\n$ (301)\n$ (142)\n$ (506)\n$ (197)\n$\n128\n$\n918\n$1,545\n$2,242\n$3,060\n$3,424\nNet Income\n$ (190)\n$ (293)\n$ (137)\n$ (483)\n$ (177)\n$\n142\n$\n913\n$1,392\n$1,863\n$2,562\n$2,916\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(2)\n$ (209)\n$ (301)\n$ (142)\n$ (529)\n$ (232)\n$\n36\n$\n590\n$1,050\n$1,585\n$2,214\n$2,614\nFiscal Year Ending December 31,\n2034\n2035\n2036\n2037\n2038\n2039\n2040\n2041\n2042\n2043\n2044\nNet Revenue\n$6,547\n$6,788\n$7,025\n$7,254\n$7,486\n$7,706\n$7,932\n$8,162\n$4,238\n$2,406\n$1,492\nGross Profit\n$5,906\n$6,116\n$6,321\n$6,518\n$6,718\n$6,907\n$7,099\n$7,296\n$3,924\n$2,221\n$1,372\nEBIT(1)\n$3,587\n$3,757\n$3,904\n$4,062\n$4,189\n$4,308\n$4,428\n$4,551\n$2,471\n$1,399\n$\n867\nNet Income\n$3,121\n$3,337\n$3,540\n$3,757\n$3,955\n$4,150\n$4,352\n$4,561\n$3,019\n$2,247\n$1,882\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(2)\n$2,798\n$2,933\n$3,050\n$3,176\n$3,276\n$3,371\n$3,465\n$3,562\n$2,496\n$1,380\n$\n822\n \n(1)\n\u201cEBIT\u201d refers to Prometheus\u2019 gross profit less total operating expenses.\n(2)\n\u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow\u201d refers to EBIT, less tax expenses, less capital expenditures, plus depreciation and amortization, less changes in net\nworking capital.\nInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Prometheus in the Merger",

These potential\ninterests are described below.\nTreatment of Equity Awards\nEach of our directors and executive officers hold outstanding Prometheus equity awards. The Prometheus equity awards held by our directors and\nexecutive officers immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated\n \n64Table of Contents\nin the Merger in the same manner as Prometheus equity awards held by employees generally. At the Effective Time, outstanding Prometheus equity\nawards held by our directors and executive officers will be treated as follows:\n \n\u2022\nEach Prometheus stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will\nbe cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate\nnumber of Company Shares underlying such Prometheus stock option by (ii) an amount equal to the Merger Consideration less the\napplicable per share exercise price of such Prometheus stock option\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nEach Prometheus RSU award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to\nreceive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such\nPrometheus RSU award by (ii) the Merger Consideration.\nThe following table sets forth, for each of Prometheus\u2019 directors and executive officers, (i) the number and value of Company Shares subject to\nvested Prometheus stock options, (ii) the number and value of Company Shares subject to unvested Prometheus stock options, (iii) the number and value\nof unvested Prometheus RSUs (which, in the case of each of Prometheus\u2019 non-employee directors, reflects the Prometheus RSUs to be granted to such\ndirector as his or her annual award on May 19, 2023) and (iv) the total value of Company Shares subject to Prometheus stock options and unvested\nRSUs, in each case, held by such director or executive officer as of May 9, 2023.

As of the\ndate of this proxy statement, no such agreements, arrangements or understandings with Merck exist.\n280G Mitigation Actions\nIf the Effective Time is not reasonably anticipated to occur by December 31, 2023, under the Merger Agreement, Prometheus may, in consultation\nwith Merck, implement strategies before the Effective Time to\n \n67\nTable of Contents\nmitigate the possible impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Pursuant to his employment letter agreement, Mr. McKenna is entitled to receive a\ngross-up payment equal to any excise taxes imposed under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (plus any taxes resulting from such additional payment)\nas a result of any compensatory payments made to him in connection with a change in control transaction (including the Merger).\nIndemnification of Directors and Officers\u037e Insurance\nDirectors and officers of Prometheus are also entitled to indemnification and covered by insurance in certain circumstances.

These rights are known as\n\u201cappraisal rights\u201d. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.\nPersons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive\npursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of their Company Shares following petition to, and\nan appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their Company Shares\ndetermined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive\npursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the\nprocedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the\nprovisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to\nexercise such rights.\nA copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.

Any person who desires to\nexercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting\nto exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that persons seek to\nexercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration\nunder the Merger Agreement.\nA holder of record of Company Shares and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds or beneficially owns, as applicable, such Company Shares\nthrough the Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to the Merger in writing or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or\nwaived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal\nof such Company Shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of\nthe Company Shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement\nthat such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents\nto receive notices given by Prometheus and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined below), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or\nits Company Shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.\nSection 262 requires that where a proposed merger is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation must notify\nstockholders that appraisal rights will be available not less than twenty (20) days before the meeting to vote on the merger. Such notice must include\neither a copy of Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed\nwithout subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes Prometheus\u2019 notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection\nwith the Merger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review\nthe text of Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the\nloss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nIf you elect to demand appraisal of your Company Shares, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: you must deliver to Prometheus a\nwritten demand for appraisal of your Company Shares prior to the\n \n69\nTable of Contents\nSpecial Meeting, which must (i) reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder of record of Company Shares who intends to demand appraisal of his,\nher or its Company Shares (and, for beneficial owners only, such demand is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial\nownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such\nbeneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Prometheus and to be set forth on the Chancery List) and (ii) that you intend to demand the\nappraisal of your shares. In addition, as described above, you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\nyou must hold or beneficially own, as applicable, your Company Shares continuously through the effective date\u037e and you must comply with the other\napplicable requirements of Section 262.\nA Prometheus stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail or deliver his, her or its written demand for appraisal to the following\naddress:\nPrometheus Biosciences, Inc.\n3050 Science Park Road\nSan Diego, CA 92121\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nWithin ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the Merger has become effective to each\nstockholder of any class or series of stock of Prometheus who is entitled to appraisal rights that the Merger was approved and that appraisal rights are\navailable for any or all shares of such class or series of stock.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation and any person who has properly and\ntimely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of the\nCompany Shares held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of Prometheus or the surviving corporation to\nfile an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should assume that Prometheus and the surviving corporation will not file such\na petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of Company Shares. Accordingly, persons who desire to have their Company Shares\nappraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in\nSection 262. If, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, no petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will\ncease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.\nAt any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a\nnamed party may withdraw the demand and accept the Merger Consideration specified by the Merger Agreement for that person\u2019s Company Shares by\ndelivering to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more\nthan sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the surviving corporation. Unless the demand is properly withdrawn by the\nperson within sixty (60) days after the effective date, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person\nwithout the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, with such approval conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just.\nIf the surviving corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or if the Delaware Court of\nChancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the person will be entitled to receive only the fair value of such person\u2019s Company\nShares determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the\nMerger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions\nof Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\n \n70\nTable of Contents\nsurviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of Company Shares not consented in writing or otherwise voted in favor of the\nMerger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the surviving corporation and the aggregate number of holders of such\nCompany Shares. Such statement must be given within ten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation or\nwithin ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.\nUpon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving\ncorporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a\nduly verified list containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their Company Shares and with whom the surviving\ncorporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such Company Shares (the \u201cChancery List\u201d). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving\ncorporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery List.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which\npersons have complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the\npersons who have demanded an appraisal of their Company Shares and who hold Company Shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates\nof Company Shares to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any person fails to comply with\nsuch direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name\nappears on the Chancery List and may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights\nunder Section 262.\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nincluding any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the Delaware Court of Chancery shall determine the fair\nvalue of Company Shares taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nMerger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion,\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date\nthe judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the\nperiod between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving\ncorporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only on the sum of (x)\nthe difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the Company Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (y)\ninterest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.\nWhen the fair value of the Company Shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest\nthereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.\nAlthough Prometheus believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and persons should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or\nlower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, the surviving corporation does not anticipate offering more than the Merger\nConsideration to any person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal\n \n71\nTable of Contents\nproceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of the relevant Company Shares is less than the Merger Consideration.\nIn determining \u201cfair value\u201d, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the\nDelaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value\nby any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court\nhas stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of\nthe enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of\nthe merged corporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant factors the Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay consider in determining \u201cfair value\u201d and that absent deficiencies in the sale process the transaction price should be given \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d\nSection 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede &\nCo. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of\nvalue,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware\nSupreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of\nproof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nThe cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her\nor its attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the\nproceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including,\nwithout limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all Company Shares entitled to appraisal not\ndismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.\nDeterminations by the Delaware Court of Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nAny person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any purpose any Company Shares\nsubject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such Company Shares, except for dividends or distributions payable\nto Prometheus stockholders of record at a date prior to the Effective Time.\nTo the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on the other hand, Section 262 will\ngovern.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights.",

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Company Shares  \nThe following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to holders of\nCompany Shares whose Company Shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Code,\nTreasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), and other applicable\nauthorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with\nretroactive effect. This discussion is limited to\n \n72Table of Contents\nholders that hold their Company Shares as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment\npurposes). This summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not a complete description of all potential U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the Merger. This summary does not describe any of the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax\njurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g., state, gift or alternative minimum tax, the Medicare\nnet investment income surtax, or any withholding considerations under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including regulations issued\nthereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith)). In addition, this summary does not address the\nU.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of Company Shares that exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL. For purposes of this discussion, a\n\u201cholder\u201d means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder or both, as the context may require.\nThis discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to\nholders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to:\n \n\u2022\nholders that may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations,\ngovernmental organizations, S corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as pass-through entities or\npartnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any investor therein, insurance companies, mutual funds, brokers or dealers in stocks,\nsecurities, commodities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities,\nregulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations,\u201d \u201cpassive foreign investment companies\u201d\nor certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders holding their Company Shares as part of a hedging, straddle or other risk reducing transaction or as part of a conversion transaction\nor other integrated investment\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders deemed to sell their Company Shares under the constructive sale provisions of the Code\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders that received their Company Shares in compensatory transactions\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders that hold their Company Shares through individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders that own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Merck or the surviving corporation\u037e\n \n\u2022\nU.S. Holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders that are required to report income no later than when such income is reported in an \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nholders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of the Company Shares (by vote or value).\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of\nCompany Shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Company Shares and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the particular tax\nconsequences to them of the Merger.\nWe have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the\nfollowing summary. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any\nchallenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.\nTHIS DISCUSSION OF MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY\nAND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL OR\n \n73\nTable of Contents\nTAX ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX\nCONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING\nUNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR OTHER TAX LAWS.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this proxy statement, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of Company Shares who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n \n\u2022\nAn individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n \n\u2022\nA corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or\nthe District of Columbia\u037e\n \n\u2022\nAn estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nA trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons\nas defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a\nUnited States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for Company Shares pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S.\nHolder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the Company Shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the\namount that such U.S. Holder paid for the Company Shares. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain\nor loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such Company Shares is more than one year at the time of the consummation of the Merger. A reduced tax\nrate on capital gains generally will apply to long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals. There are limitations on the\nrate on capital gains generally will apply to long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals. There are limitations on the\ndeductibility of capital losses. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Company Shares at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must\ndetermine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Company Shares.\nPayments made to a U.S. Holder in exchange for Company Shares pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and\nbackup withholding at a rate of 24%. To avoid backup withholding on such payments, U.S. Holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should\ncomplete and return to the exchange agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal certifying that such holder is a United\nStates person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such holder is not subject to\nbackup withholding. Certain types of U.S. Holders (including, with respect to certain types of payments, corporations) generally are not subject to\nbackup withholding or information reporting rules.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from cash payments to a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger under the backup\nwithholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against such U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup\nwithholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this proxy statement, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Company Shares that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an\nentity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n \n74\nTable of Contents\nNon-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax consequences that may be\nrelevant to them in light of their particular circumstances.\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n \n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable\nincome tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such\ngain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a\ncorporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate specified under an applicable\ntax treaty)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition, and\ncertain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate\nspecified under an applicable tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder recognized in the same\ntaxable year (if any) provided the Non-U.S. Holder timely files U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nCompany Shares held by such Non-U.S. Holder constitute a United States real property interest (a \u201cUSRPI\u201d) by reason of Prometheus\u2019\nstatus as a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code (a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any\ntime during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time or the period that the Non-U.S. Holder held the\napplicable Company Shares.\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, Prometheus believes it is not a USRPHC. Because the determination of whether Prometheus is a\nUSRPHC depends, however, on the fair market value of its USRPIs relative to the fair market value of its non-U.S. real property interests and other\nbusiness assets, there can be no assurance Prometheus is not a USRPHC. Even if Prometheus is a USRPHC, gain arising from the sale or other taxable\ndisposition of Prometheus common stock by a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if Prometheus common stock is \u201cregularly\ntraded,\u201d as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market and such Non-U.S. Holder owned, actually and\nconstructively, 5% or less of Prometheus common stock throughout the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or other taxable\ndisposition or the Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period.\nNon-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.\nPayments made to Non-U.S. Holders in exchange for Company Shares pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS\nand backup withholding at a rate of 24%. Non-U.S. Holders generally can avoid information reporting and backup withholding by providing the exchange\nagent with the applicable and properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8 certifying the holder\u2019s non-U.S. status or by otherwise establishing an\nexemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange\nagreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax\nliability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

relating\nthereto.\nNotwithstanding the limitations in the preceding paragraphs or any other provision in the Merger Agreement, if at any time prior to the Prometheus\nStockholder Approval, Prometheus or any of its representatives has received a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal from any person or group of\npersons that did not result from a material breach of Prometheus\u2019 obligations relating to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement, then if the\nBoard (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside

inconsistent\nwith its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Prometheus and any of its representatives may enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement\nwith such person or group of

days after such commencement, against acceptance by Prometheus\nstockholders of such tender offer or exchange offer, or (v) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), a\n\u201cCompany Board Recommendation Change\u201d)\u037e provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, a \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d communication by the Board or\nany

the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the\nExchange Act, or any substantially similar communication to either of the foregoing will not be deemed a Company Board Recommendation Change or\nprohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement (provided that any such disclosure by Prometheus shall state that the Company Board\nRecommendation continues to be in effect unless, prior to the time of such public disclosure, a Company Board Recommendation Change has been made\nin accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement).\nNotwithstanding the limitations in the preceding paragraphs or any other provision in the Merger Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the\nPrometheus Stockholder Approval, the Board (or a committee thereof) may (i) in response to the receipt of a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal\nreceived after the date of\n \n91\nTable of Contents\nthe Merger Agreement that did not result from a material breach of Prometheus\u2019 obligations relating to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, or the occurrence of an Intervening Event, effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, or (ii) in response to a bona fide, written\nAcquisition Proposal received after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result in a material breach of Prometheus\u2019 obligations relating to non-\nsolicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such applicable Acquisition Proposal and terminate the\nMerger Agreement, provided that (a) the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that\nthe failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (b) in the case of receipt of an\nAcquisition Proposal, the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,\nthat such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, that an Intervening Event has occurred, (c)\nPrometheus provides written notice to Merck at least three business days prior to effecting a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating\nthe Merger Agreement of its intent to take such action, specifying the reasons therefor (a \u201cChange of Recommendation Notice\u201d), (d) prior to effecting\nsuch Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating the Merger Agreement, Prometheus must, and must cause its representatives to, be\nreasonably available to negotiate with Merck in good faith (to the extent Merck desires to negotiate) during such three business day period to make such\nadjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as would obviate the basis for a Company Board Recommendation Change or the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement and (e) no earlier than the end of such three business day period, the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in\ngood faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, after considering any amendments to the terms and conditions of the\nMerger Agreement proposed by Merck in a binding written offer irrevocably made by Merck during such three business day period, that the failure to\ntake such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law (and, in the case of receipt of such\nAcquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal). Following delivery of a Change of Recommendation\nNotice in the case of a Superior Proposal, in the event of any change to the financial terms (including any change to the amount or form of consideration\npayable) or other revision to the terms or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, Prometheus must provide a new Change of Recommendation Notice\nto Merck, and any Company Board Recommendation Change or termination of the Merger Agreement following delivery of such new Change of\nRecommendation Notice must again be subject to clause (c) and clause (d) of the immediately preceding sentence for a period of two business days.\nNotwithstanding the limitations in the preceding paragraphs or any other provision in the Merger Agreement, nothing in the Merger Agreement\nprohibits Prometheus or the Board (or a committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to Prometheus stockholders a position contemplated by Rule\n14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or

However, Merck is not required to recognize service with Prometheus rendered prior to the Effective Time for purposes of benefit accrual\n(other than for purposes of severance or vacation) or to the extent that doing so would result in the duplication of benefits. In addition, Merck is required\nto use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) ensure that each continuing employee is immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any\nMerck employee benefit plan, compensation plan, or severance arrangement to the extent the Merck plans replace coverage under a comparable\nPrometheus plan in which such continuing employee participates immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) waive, or cause to be waived, all waiting\nperiods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements, and actively-at-work or similar requirements to the same extent such\nlimitations are waived under any comparable plan of Prometheus applicable to such continuing employee prior to the Effective Time, (iii) recognize, for\npurposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by a continuing\nemployee in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, and (iv) ensure that the accounts of such continuing employees under any new Merck\nplan that is a flexible spending plan are credited with any unused balance in the account of such continuing employee under the prior Prometheus plan.\nPrior to the Effective Time, Prometheus will take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to terminate Prometheus\u2019 equity incentive plans,\neffective as of, and contingent upon, the closing of the Merger.\nEfforts to Consummate the Merger\nEach of Prometheus and Merck must use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or\nadvisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including (i) to cause the conditions to the other party\u2019s obligation to\nclose to be satisfied as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, (ii) subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, obtaining, as promptly\nas practicable after the date of this Agreement, and maintaining all necessary actions or non-actions and consents from governmental authorities and\nmaking all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with governmental authorities, that are necessary to consummate the Merger, (iii) resisting,\ncontesting, appealing and removing any legal proceeding and vacating, lifting, reversing or overturning any order whether temporary, preliminary or\npermanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, restricts or restrains the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement and (iv) upon writing request of Merck and Merger Sub, obtaining all necessary or appropriate consents under material contracts to which\nPrometheus is a party in connection with the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and (v) reasonably\ncooperate with the other party or parties with respect to any of the foregoing.\n \n94\nTable of Contents\nSubject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Prometheus, Merck and Merger Sub have agreed to take any and all actions reasonably necessary\nto cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any foreign antitrust laws as soon as practicable (and in\nany event by the date that is at least five (5) business days before the Effective Time), and to avoid any impediment to the consummation of the Merger\nunder any antitrust laws, including (1) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, conduct\nof business restrictions, a sale or disposition of such assets or businesses as are required to be divested or a license or grant of commercialization rights\nto businesses, product lines, fields of use, divisions, business arrangements, contracts, assets or interests therein of Prometheus, (2) amending any\nventure or other arrangement of Prometheus and (3) cooperating with each other and using their respective reasonable best efforts to oppose, contest\nand resist fully and vigorously any legal proceeding, including by defending through litigation, pursing vigorously all available avenues of administrative\nand judicial appeal and seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order that may result from such legal proceedings, whether temporary,\npreliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, in each case, as may be required in order to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, to\noccur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the Termination Date) and to otherwise avoid the entry of, or to effect the\ndissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated hereby, including the Merger\u037e provided, however, that (x) Merck and its affiliates shall not be obligated to take the foregoing actions\ncontemplated by this sentence (A) with respect to Merck, its affiliates or their respective assets, categories of assets, businesses, relationships,\ncontractual rights, obligations or arrangements, and any intellectual property rights thereto or embodied therein or any venture or other arrangement\u037e nor\n(B) with respect to Prometheus, to the extent such actions would have any more than an immaterial effect on the business, operations or financial\ncondition of Prometheus and (y) Prometheus may not take any of the foregoing actions without Merck\u2019s prior written consent. Further, and for the\navoidance of doubt, without the written consent of Prometheus, Merck will not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act (by pull and refile, or\notherwise) or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or any other governmental authority not to consummate the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement without the written consent of Prometheus, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, each of Merck and Prometheus must (among other things) (i) keep the other party reasonably apprised\nwith respect to any substantive oral communications with any governmental authority regarding the Merger and cooperate in the filing of any analyses,\npresentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or other written communications explaining or defending the Merger, articulating any regulatory or\ncompetitive argument and/or responding to requests or objections made by any governmental authority, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any\nsubstantive communication from any governmental regarding any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in connection with any\nfilings or investigations with, by or before any governmental authority relating to the Merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding any proceedings initiated by a private party, and (iii) provide the other party a reasonable advance opportunity to review all written\ncommunication with a governmental authority regarding the Merger, and give each other an opportunity to participate in each of such substantive\nmeetings and substantive conference calls.\nIndemnification of Directors and Officers\u037e Insurance\nMerck and the surviving corporation must (and Merck is required to cause the surviving corporation to) (i) honor and fulfill in all respects the\nobligations of Prometheus under (a) certain indemnification agreements entered into between Prometheus, on the one hand, and any of its current and\nformer officers and directors and any person who becomes a director or officer of Prometheus, on the other hand and (b) certain indemnification\nagreements entered into between Prometheus or any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise,\non the one hand, and any person serving or who served as a director,\n \n95\nTable of Contents\nofficer, member, trustee or fiduciary of any of the foregoing at the request of Prometheus, in each case, prior to the Effective Time, on the other hand ((a)\nand (b) collectively, the \u201cIndemnified Persons\u201d), and (c) the indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions in the certificate of\nincorporation or bylaws in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the\nsixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person against any\ncosts, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and\namounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any threatened or actual action, suit, claim, proceeding, investigation, arbitration or inquiry, whether\ncivil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each an \u201cIndemnified Proceeding\u201d) to the extent such Indemnified Proceeding arises directly or indirectly\nout of or pertains or relates directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Person\u2019s capacity as a\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of Prometheus or other affiliates (including as a fiduciary with respect to any employment benefit plan) or by reason of\nthe fact that such Indemnified Person is or was serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of Prometheus or its affiliates or at the request of\nPrometheus as such (including as a fiduciary with respect to any employee benefit plan) of another person (regardless, in each case, of whether such\naction or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time), (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement or (iii) the enforcement of any of the rights of such Indemnified Person (or his or her heirs or legal representatives) under the Merger\nAgreement. In addition, for six years after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation is required to (and Merck shall cause the surviving corporation to)\ncause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and\nadvancement of expenses that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons than the corresponding provisions in the certificate of incorporation and\nbylaws of the Company as of the date of the Merger Agreement, and during such six-year period, such provisions cannot be repealed, amended or\notherwise modified in any manner adverse to such Indemnified Persons, except as required by applicable law.\nFor six years after the Effective Time and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Merck and the surviving corporation shall (and Merck\nshall cause the surviving corporation to) advance, prior to the final disposition of any Indemnified Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought\nunder the Merger Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019\nfees and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such Indemnified Proceeding upon receipt of an\nundertaking by such Indemnified Person, to the extent required by law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable\njudgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification under the Merger Agreement.\nFor six years after the Effective Time, Merck is required to, and shall cause the surviving corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the directors and\nofficers of Prometheus, as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides\ncoverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (\u201cD&O Insurance\u201d) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event provides coverage not\nless favorable to the insured persons than. Prometheus\u2019 equivalent insurance policies in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement. However, in no\nevent will the surviving corporation be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium amount\npaid by Prometheus prior to the date of the Merger Agreement. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been\nsatisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by Prometheus prior to the Effective Time. The surviving corporation will (and Merck shall cause the\nsurviving corporation to) maintain the D&O Insurance \u201ctail\u201d policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder\nfor six years after the Effective Time.\nIf any Indemnified Person notifies the surviving corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time that a claim, action, suit,\nproceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) has been made against such Indemnified Person, the indemnification\nprovisions of the Merger\n \n96\nTable of Contents\nAgreement shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.\nIn the event that Merck or the surviving corporation (or any of its successor or assigns) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is\nnot the continuing entity of such consolidation or merger, or engages in any division transaction or transfers, coneys or otherwise disposes of all or\nsubstantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of\nMerck and the surviving corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in the indemnification section of the Merger Agreement.\nMiscellaneous Covenants\nThe Merger Agreement contains additional agreements among Prometheus, Merck and Merger Sub relating to, among other matters:\n \n\u2022\nthe filing by Prometheus of this proxy statement with the SEC and cooperation in response to any comments from the SEC with respect to\nthis proxy statement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nnotification upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain matters\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe coordination of press releases and other public announcements or filings relating to the Merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nactions necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nreporting requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe delisting of the Company Shares from Nasdaq and the deregistration of Company Shares under the Exchange Act\u037e\n \n\u2022\nanti-takeover statutes that become applicable to the transactions\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nany litigation against Prometheus and/or its directors or its officers relating to or in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Merger or\nany other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nConditions to the Merger",

These COBRA continuation\ncoverage payments are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d benefits in that they will only be paid following the Merger if the named executive officer experiences a\nqualifying termination of employment.\n \n(4)\nAmount in this column represents the estimated tax gross-up payment payable to Mr. McKenna pursuant to his employment letter agreement,\nbased on the assumptions noted above and taking into account any and all applicable federal, state, and local excise, income, or other taxes that\nwould be payable on such gross-up payment at the highest applicable rates. The portion of such tax gross-up payment related solely to the equity\naward acceleration ($24,582,163) is a \u201csingle-trigger\u201d benefit that will be received solely because of the Merger and regardless of whether Mr.\nMcKenna\u2019s employment is terminated. The portions of any tax gross-up payment related to Mr. McKenna\u2019s severance payments, 2023 pro-rated\nbonus and subsidized COBRA continuation coverage ($1,457,132) are a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d benefit in that they will only be paid following the Merger\nif Mr. McKenna experiences a qualifying termination of employment in accordance with his employment letter agreement. The estimates of \u201cexcess\nparachute payments\u201d for purposes of this calculation do not take into account any mitigation for payments which could be shown (under the facts\nand circumstances) not to be contingent on a change in control or for any payments deemed to be reasonable compensation.\nVote Required\nThe Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Prometheus approve the following resolution:\n\u201cBE IT RESOLVED THAT: \nthe compensation that may be paid or become payable to Prometheus\u2019 named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed\npursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the section entitled \u201cProposal No. 2: Advisory Vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal\n\u2014The Merger Compensation Proposal\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Prometheus\u2019 Named Executive Officers\u201d\nbeginning on page 105 of the proxy statement dated May 16, 2023, including the tables, associated footnotes and narrative discussion, is\nhereby approved, ratified and confirmed on a non-binding, advisory basis.\u201d\n \n106\nTable of Contents\nApproval of the Merger Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the votes cast\naffirmatively or negatively (excluding abstentions) at the Special Meeting by the holders entitled to vote thereon. Each Company Share issued and\noutstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to one vote at the Special Meeting. If a stockholder signs and returns a proxy and\ndoes not indicate how he, she or it wishes to vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal, such stockholder\u2019s Company Shares will be voted in favor of\nthe Merger Compensation Proposal. If a Prometheus stockholder abstains from voting, it will not be considered to be a vote cast on the Merger\nCompensation Proposal and will have no effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. If a Prometheus stockholder fails to vote, it will have no effect on\nthe Merger Compensation Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal.\nThe vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to\napprove the Merger Proposal and vote against or abstain with respect to the Merger Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the\nMerger Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Prometheus or Merck. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved\nand the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-\nbinding, advisory vote of Prometheus\u2019 stockholders on the Merger Compensation Proposal.\nBoard Recommendation\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE \u201cFOR\u201d THE MERGER COMPENSATION PROPOSAL.\n \n107\nTable of Contents\nPROPOSAL NO. 3: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING",
