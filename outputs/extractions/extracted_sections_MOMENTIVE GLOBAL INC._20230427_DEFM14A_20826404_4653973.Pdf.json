You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this\nproxy statement without charge by following the instructions in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\nA:\nOn March 13, 2023, we announced that Momentive entered into the merger agreement. Under the\nmerger agreement, Parent will acquire Momentive for $9.46 in cash per share of Momentive common\nstock (without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes). In order to complete the\nmerger, Momentive\u2019s stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of Momentive common\nstock as of the record date must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This\napproval is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.\u201d The Momentive Board is\nfurnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of Momentive common\nstock in connection with the solicitation of proxies of Momentive\u2019s stockholders to be voted at the\nspecial meeting.\nThis proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger,\nthe merger agreement and related agreements and transactions, the special meeting, and the matters\nto be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your\nshares of Momentive common stock without attending the special meeting and to ensure that your\nshares of Momentive common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.\nYour vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit\na proxy as soon as possible.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Momentive?\nA:\nThe proposed merger is the acquisition of Momentive by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement is approved by Momentive\u2019s stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger\nagreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Momentive, with Momentive\ncontinuing as the surviving corporation.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Momentive Board established a strategic committee of the Momentive Board (which we refer to as the\n\u201cStrategic Committee\u201d) on August 12, 2021 to oversee the exploration and evaluation of potential strategic\nalternatives available to Momentive. The Strategic Committee was formed in light of (1) the potentially\nsignificant workload that could be involved in evaluating potential strategic alternatives\u037e (2) the possibility that\nMomentive management may need feedback and direction on relatively short notice\u037e and (3) the benefits and\nconvenience of having a subset of directors oversee and direct the process of considering potential strategic\nalternatives. The Momentive Board authorized and instructed the Strategic Committee, among other things,\nto (1) oversee and provide assistance to Momentive management and Momentive\u2019s advisors with respect to\nthe exploration, evaluation, consideration, review and negotiation of the terms and conditions of any potential\nstrategic alternative, including a possible sale of Momentive\u037e (2) take such other actions with respect to any\nstrategic alternative as the Strategic Committee deemed necessary, appropriate or advisable\u037e and (3)\nrecommend to the Momentive Board the actions, if any, that should be taken by Momentive with respect to\nany strategic alternative or transaction. The Momentive Board retained the power and authority to approve\nthe final decision on pursuing a strategic alternative, including a sale of Momentive, and the entry by\nMomentive into a definitive agreement providing for a sale transaction was not conditioned on any specific\nrecommendation by the Strategic Committee. It was also understood that the Momentive Board would\ncontinue to have an active role in the consideration of potential strategic alternatives. The Momentive Board\ndid not provide for the payment of any compensation to the members of the Strategic Committee in\nconsideration of their service on the Strategic Committee. The Momentive Board also delegated to the\nStrategic Committee the authority to engage, on behalf of Momentive, one or more financial advisors to\nassist in connection with these matters. Upon formation, the Strategic Committee was initially composed of\nSue Decker, as chair of the Strategic Committee, David Ebersman and Brad Smith.\nOn October 28, 2021, Momentive entered into a merger agreement with Zendesk, Inc. (which we refer to as\n\u201cZendesk\u201d) providing for the acquisition of Momentive by Zendesk (which we refer to as the\n\u201cZendesk merger agreement\u201d) in a stock-for-stock transaction. The entry by Momentive into the Zendesk\nmerger agreement was the result of a process conducted by Momentive and overseen by the Momentive\nBoard and the Strategic Committee to solicit interest regarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive\nfrom a number of potential strategic acquirors and financial sponsors (the \u201c2021 solicitation process\u201d).\nAdditional information regarding the 2021 solicitation process and the Zendesk merger agreement was\npublicly disclosed by Momentive in the definitive proxy statement filed by Momentive on January 7, 2022\nwith the SEC in connection with Momentive\u2019s solicitation of proxies from Momentive stockholders to adopt\nthe Zendesk merger agreement, and the other documents filed by Momentive with the SEC. The terms used\nin this proxy statement to refer to counterparties with which Momentive engaged do not correspond to terms\nused to refer to the counterparties that participated in the 2021 solicitation process as described in the\ndefinitive proxy statement filed by Momentive on January 7, 2022. Momentive common stock closed trading\nat a price of $20.61 on October 6, 2021, the day prior to media reports that Momentive was exploring\noptions, including a potential sale after receiving takeover interest. Momentive common stock closed trading\nat a price of $24.92 per share on October 28, 2021, prior to the announcement of Momentive\u2019s entry into the\nZendesk merger agreement following the close of trading on October 28, 2021, and closed trading at $22.92\nper share on October 29, 2022, the first trading day after the announcement of Momentive\u2019s entry into the\nZendesk merger agreement.\nOn February 25, 2022, Zendesk terminated the Zendesk merger agreement after Zendesk\u2019s stockholders\nfailed to approve the issuance of shares of Zendesk common stock to Momentive stockholders as\nconsideration in connection with the acquisition. Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of\n$15.72 per share on February 28, 2022, the first trading day after the announcement of the termination of the\nZendesk merger agreement.\nAs described below, following the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, the Momentive Board and\nthe Strategic Committee continued to consider and explore, from time to time, various potential strategic\nalternatives for Momentive, including, among others, (1) the continued execution of Momentive\u2019s standalone\nbusiness plan, with Momentive remaining an independent entity\u037e (2) new business and product initiatives,\noperational adjustments, cost-cutting initiatives and other revisions to Momentive\u2019s business plan\u037e (3) return\nof capital to Momentive stockholders, including through a share buyback program\u037e and (4) business\ncombinations and other financial and strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of Momentive.\n39TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 25, 2022, Momentive\u2019s engagement letters with each of Allen & Company LLC (which we refer\nto as \u201cAllen & Company\u201d) and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (which we refer to as \u201cJ.P. Morgan\u201d),\nMomentive\u2019s financial advisors in connection with the 2021 solicitation process, expired pursuant to their\nterms.\nOn February 28, 2022, Momentive announced the execution of a letter agreement with Legion Partners and\ncertain related persons and entities, pursuant to which, among other things, Sagar Gupta, Senior Analyst\nand Head of Technology, Media and Telecommunications Investing at Legion Partners, was appointed to the\nMomentive Board and to the Strategic Committee. On February 28, 2022, Mr. Smith stepped down as a\ndirector of Momentive and member of Strategic Committee. Following the appointment of Mr. Gupta to the\nMomentive Board, the Strategic Committee was composed of Ms. Decker, Mr. Ebersman and Mr. Gupta.\nFrom time to time prior to and following the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, certain\nMomentive stockholders contacted Momentive regarding governance, leadership and other strategic and\noperational matters at Momentive, and Momentive management and directors would seek to engage in\ndiscussions with these parties as appropriate.\nThe Strategic Committee met in March 2022 following the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement to\nreview the 2021 solicitation process and discuss other strategic alternatives available to Momentive. The\nStrategic Committee considered whether to engage one or more additional financial advisors in connection\nwith the continued exploration and evaluation of potential strategic alternatives available to Momentive. The\nStrategic Committee met with several potential advisors to consider their candidacy for this role.\nIn addition, from time to time following the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, representatives of\ncertain financial sponsors that had participated in the 2021 solicitation process contacted Zander Lurie,\nMomentive\u2019s chief executive officer, to discuss Momentive\u2019s business. Two such financial sponsors, which\nwe refer to as \u201cFinancial Sponsor A\u201d and \u201cFinancial Sponsor B\u201d indicated to Mr. Lurie a non-specific\ninterest in continuing discussions with respect to a potential strategic transaction involving Momentive. Mr.\nLurie would update the Strategic Committee with respect to these outreaches.\nOn March 25, 2022, the Strategic Committee met with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, Momentive\u2019s outside\ncounsel (which we refer to as \u201cWilson Sonsini\u201d), in attendance. At the Strategic Committee\u2019s invitation,\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners attended a portion of the meeting to present to the Strategic Committee\ntheir qualifications and experience acting as financial advisor to companies in Momentive\u2019s industry, as well\nas their preliminary views on Momentive\u2019s financial profile and its strategic alternatives. After representatives\nof Qatalyst Partners left the meeting, Mr. Lurie discussed the outreaches by Financial Sponsor A and\nFinancial Sponsor B. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive\nmanagement in attendance, to discuss these matters. The Strategic Committee, in executive session,\nconsidered the qualifications and expertise of Qatalyst Partners and other various potential advisors to act\nas financial advisor to Momentive, and requested that Qatalyst Partners submit a proposal with respect to\nthe terms of an engagement by Momentive. Qatalyst Partners provided an initial draft of an engagement\nletter with respect to the engagement on March 29, 2022.\nOn March 28, 2022, Financial Sponsor A delivered a written, non-binding indication of interest to the\nMomentive Board expressing its interest in acquiring Momentive at an unspecified market premium to the\nthen-current market price of Momentive common stock. Momentive had previously entered into a\nconfidentiality agreement with Financial Sponsor A as part of the 2021 solicitation process, which remained\nin effect. On that day, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of $16.96 per share.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Members of Momentive\nmanagement presented a draft long-range plan for Momentive, which reflected updates to the long-range\nplan for Momentive previously approved by the Momentive Board prior to the execution of the Zendesk\nmerger agreement to reflect recent trends and headwinds in Momentive\u2019s business and Momentive\nmanagement\u2019s expectations for deteriorations in Momentive\u2019s prospective operational and financial\nperformance, including as a result of the adverse impact of the pendency and termination of the acquisition\nby Zendesk on Momentive\u2019s operations and hiring and retention of employees. The Strategic Committee\ndiscussed the plan, and requested that Momentive management present the draft plan to the Momentive\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard at a subsequently scheduled meeting to obtain the views and feedback of the Momentive directors on\nthe draft plan. The Strategic Committee reviewed with Mr. Lurie and representatives of Qatalyst Partners the\nnon-binding indication of interest received from Financial Sponsor A, and discussed whether and how\nMomentive should respond. The Strategic Committee also discussed the possibility of initiating another\nprocess to solicit interest regarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive from potential counterparties\nat that time and other strategic alternatives available to Momentive, including continuing to execute\nMomentive\u2019s standalone business plan. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without\nMomentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters.\nOn April 6, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners presented a preliminary financial overview of Momentive and certain market perspectives on\nMomentive. The Strategic Committee discussed the possibility of engaging in discussions with Financial\nSponsor A in response to its indication of interest, as well as commencing a broader outreach to additional\ncounterparties to solicit interest regarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive at that time. The\nStrategic Committee also discussed the potential risks of engaging with Financial Sponsor A and of an\noutreach to additional counterparties, including potential public disclosure leaks, Momentive management\nand employee distraction, and adverse impacts on Momentive\u2019s business and employee morale, particularly\nif a transaction was not ultimately consummated. In this regard, the Strategic Committee noted that the\nadverse impacts would be heightened due to the recent termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, and\nthe increase in the likelihood of those risks if Momentive were to engage extensively with Financial Sponsor\nA or engage in a broader private or public process. The Strategic Committee determined to recommend to\nthe Momentive Board that Momentive engage with Financial Sponsor A to understand whether it would,\nfollowing access to Momentive management and non-public information, be in a position to quickly submit a\nmore specific acquisition proposal. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without\nMomentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance. In executive session,\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an update on the negotiation of the terms of Qatalyst Partners\u2019\nengagement. The Strategic Committee approved the engagement of Qatalyst Partners to serve as financial\nadvisor to Momentive consistent with the terms discussed at the meeting and directed Momentive\nmanagement and Wilson Sonsini to finalize the engagement. The Strategic Committee noted Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which Momentive operates and experience\nadvising technology companies in connection with potential strategic transactions. The Momentive Board\nalso received and reviewed from Qatalyst Partners a conflict disclosure letter, from which the Momentive\nBoard did not identify matters that would limit Qatalyst Partners\u2019 ability to fulfill its responsibilities as\nfinancial advisor to Momentive. On April 8, 2022, Momentive entered into an engagement letter with Qatalyst\nPartners to act as Momentive\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the continued exploration and evaluation\nof potential strategic alternatives.\nAlso on April 8, 2022, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Members of Momentive\nmanagement presented a draft long-range plan for Momentive previously presented to the Strategic\nCommittee, including updates to reflect recent trends and headwinds in Momentive\u2019s business and\nMomentive management\u2019s expectations for deteriorations in Momentive\u2019s prospective operational and\nfinancial performance, including as a result of the adverse impact of the pendency and termination of the\nacquisition by Zendesk on Momentive\u2019s operations and hiring and retention of employees. Following\ndiscussion, the Momentive Board approved the long-range plan presented at the meeting, including the\nunaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 included in the updated long-\nrange plan (which we refer to as the \u201cApril 2022 long-range plan\u201d). Additional information about the\npreparation and substance of the April 2022 long-range plan is contained in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d. The Momentive Board reviewed the\nnon-binding indication of interest received from Financial Sponsor A. The Momentive Board considered the\npossibility of engaging in discussions with Financial Sponsor A, as well as commencing a broader outreach\nat that time to additional financial sponsors and potential strategic acquirors to solicit interest regarding a\nstrategic transaction involving Momentive. The Momentive Board also discussed the potential risks of\nengaging with Financial Sponsor A and of an outreach to additional counterparties, including adverse\nimpacts on Momentive\u2019s business and employee morale, particularly if a transaction was not ultimately\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconsummated. In this regard, the Strategic Committee noted that the adverse impacts would be heightened\ndue to the recent termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, and the increase in the likelihood of those\nrisks if Momentive were to engage extensively with Financial Sponsor A or engage in a broader private or\npublic process. The Strategic Committee delivered its recommendation that Momentive engage with\nFinancial Sponsor A, allowing access to Momentive management and non-public information, to understand\nwhether it would be in a position to quickly submit a more specific acquisition proposal. Following\ndiscussion, the Momentive Board authorized engaging with Financial Sponsor A and providing due diligence\ninformation, including Momentive\u2019s updated long-range plan, to Financial Sponsor A in order to understand\nwhether it would submit a more specific acquisition proposal. The Momentive Board also determined not to\ninitiate a broader outreach process at this time.\nOn April 18, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided a summary of the April 2022 long-range\nplan to representatives of Financial Sponsor A in accordance with the Momentive Board\u2019s instructions.\nOn April 19, 2022, members of Momentive management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners met with\nrepresentatives of Financial Sponsor A to provide due diligence information regarding Momentive\u2019s business.\nOn April 20, 2022, a member of the Momentive Board received an unsolicited inbound inquiry from a\npotential strategic counterparty (which we refer to as \u201cStrategic A\u201d) about the possibility of a potential\ncombination.\nOn April 22, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners provided an update on discussions with Financial Sponsor A and reviewed the inquiry received from\nStrategic A. The Strategic Committee discussed with Qatalyst Partners considerations with respect to\nStrategic A\u2019s ability to finance and consummate an acquisition of Momentive. Following the discussion, the\nStrategic Committee determined that Strategic A would not be in a position to acquire Momentive on the\nbasis of these considerations and declined to engage in discussions with Strategic A. The Strategic\nCommittee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners in attendance, and discussed Momentive\u2019s business and strategic alternatives available to\nMomentive.\nOn April 25, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A contacted Mr. Ebersman and communicated to\nhim that they would not be able to submit a proposal with respect to an acquisition of Momentive that they\nbelieved the Momentive Board would find acceptable.

Representatives of Qatalyst Partners, in accordance with the direction of\nthe Strategic Committee, noted that the Momentive Board might be receptive to an acquisition proposal at a\nprice of at least $20.00 per share. Representatives of Financial Sponsor A indicated their belief that there\nwas\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\na \u201c50-50\u201d possibility that they would be in a position to acquire Momentive at a price of $20.00 per share.\nFollowing the discussion, representatives of Financial Sponsor A requested additional due diligence\ninformation to support an acquisition proposal at that level. On that day, Momentive common stock closed\ntrading at a price of $16.30 per share.\nOn May 6, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance.

The representatives of Financial Sponsor A noted that they continue to be\nadmirers of the business and hoped to be able to re-visit the opportunity once the market and business\ntrends stabilize. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners informed the members of the Strategic Committee of\nFinancial Sponsor A\u2019s communication. On that day, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of\n$12.09 per share.\nOn May 20, 2022, the Momentive Board met with members of Momentive management and with\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance.

The Momentive Board considered the possibility of commencing a\nbroader outreach to additional financial sponsors and potential strategic acquirors to solicit interest\nregarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive.

Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners provided an update on discussions with Financial Sponsor A. In addition, representatives of\nQatalyst Partners presented certain market perspectives on Momentive and a review of recent disruptions in\nMomentive\u2019s industry and the broader technology sector. The Strategic Committee discussed the possibility\nof commencing a broader outreach to additional financial sponsors and potential strategic acquirors to solicit\ninterest regarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive. The Strategic Committee noted that Financial\nSponsor A had not submitted an acquisition proposal, the headwinds and trends in Momentive\u2019s industry\nand business, and the volatility in the price of Momentive common stock and companies in the technology\nsector generally that would make an agreement on a potential acquisition price more challenging. The\nStrategic Committee also considered the risks of pursuing a transaction with Financial Sponsor A or other\ncounterparties that was not ultimately consummated, including adverse impacts on Momentive\u2019s business\nand employee morale. Following discussion, based on these considerations and the fact that Financial\nSponsor A had not submitted an acquisition proposal, the Strategic Committee determined not to continue\ndiscussions with Financial Sponsor A, and to recommend to the Momentive Board that Momentive focus on\nthe execution of its business plan at this time and not initiate a broader outreach process. The Momentive\nStrategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of\nQatalyst Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss these matters.

Mr. Lurie referred these individuals to Qatalyst Partners for\nfurther discussions. Mr. Lurie and Qatalyst Partners would update the Strategic Committee and the\nMomentive Board with respect to these outreaches.

Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners presented certain market perspectives on Momentive and its industry. The Strategic Committee\ndiscussed the possibility of initiating an outreach process to potential counterparties to solicit interest in a\npotential strategic transaction involving Momentive and determined that it was not the right time to initiate a\nprocess at that time due to volatility in the market prices of Momentive common stock and other companies\nin Momentive\u2019s industry and the technology sector generally.

The Strategic Committee discussed the possibility of re-engaging in discussions with Financial\nSponsor A at that time, including as part of a broader outreach to additional counterparties. The Strategic\nCommittee noted that Financial Sponsor A had previously engaged in discussions with Momentive without\nsubmitting an acquisition proposal, and the headwinds, uncertainty and market volatility in the technology\nsector generally, as well as in Momentive\u2019s business, had not improved since that time. The Strategic\nCommittee also considered the risks of pursuing a transaction with Financial Sponsor A or other\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncounterparties that was not ultimately consummated, including adverse impacts on Momentive\u2019s business\nand employee morale. Following discussion, based on these considerations and the Strategic Committee\u2019s\nuncertainty regarding whether Financial Sponsor A would submit an actionable acquisition proposal, the\nStrategic Committee determined not to re-engage with Financial Sponsor A at that time. The Strategic\nCommittee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners in attendance, to discuss these matters.\nOn August 28, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance.

The proposal contemplated an acquisition of\nMomentive by a portfolio company of Financial Sponsor C.\nOn October 18, 2022, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of $6.49 per share. This was the\nlast trading day prior to published rumors that Momentive was considering a potential sale.\nOn October 19, 2022, Bloomberg and other media outlets published a report that Momentive was\nconsidering a sale after receiving takeover interest.\nAlso on October 19, 2022, representatives of STG contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners following\nthe media reports that Momentive was considering a sale. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed\nwith representatives of STG their non-specific interest in a potential acquisition of Momentive and their\ncapacity to consummate a potential acquisition.

Mr. Lurie referred the representatives of STG\nto Qatalyst Partners.\nAlso on October 19, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor (which we refer to as \u201cFinancial Sponsor\nD\u201d) contacted representatives of Momentive following the media reports that Momentive was considering a\nsale. Representatives of Financial Sponsor D had previously contacted representatives of Momentive in\nSeptember 2022, including a director, to express a non-specific interest in discussing Momentive\u2019s\nbusiness.\nOn October 20, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners provided an update on discussions with Financial Sponsor A, including the request for due\ndiligence information to confirm its valuation, and reviewed the acquisition proposal received from Financial\nSponsor C. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also noted that other financial sponsors had recently\ncontacted representatives of Momentive and Qatalyst Partners and expressed an interest in discussing\nMomentive\u2019s business. The Strategic Committee discussed whether to initiate a process to solicit interest in\na potential strategic transaction based on the proposal from Financial Sponsor C and the expressions of\ninterest received from Financial Sponsor A and other financial sponsors, as well as the progress of\nMomentive\u2019s strategic initiatives and cost-cutting initiatives. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners presented\na preliminary financial overview of the valuations for Momentive proposed by Financial Sponsor A and\nFinancial Sponsor C, as well as certain market perspectives on Momentive.

The Strategic Committee\ndiscussed timing and process considerations in an outreach process. The Strategic Committee also\ndiscussed the potential risks\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof an outreach, including Momentive management and employee distraction and adverse impacts on\nMomentive\u2019s business and employee morale if a transaction was pursued but not consummated, and the\nincrease in the likelihood of those risks in a wider private or public process relative to a more targeted\noutreach. The Strategic Committee expressed a belief that a wider process would not be necessary given\nthat Momentive\u2019s interest in a potential acquisition would be widely known in light of the 2021 solicitation\nprocess and recent media reports that Momentive was considering a sale. Following discussion, the\nStrategic Committee (1) directed Qatalyst Partners to inform Financial Sponsor C that it needed to improve\nthe terms of its proposal\u037e (2) determined to permit Financial Sponsor A to conduct additional due diligence in\norder to provide a firm acquisition proposal\u037e and (3) directed Qatalyst Partners to commence an outreach to\na group of other potential acquirers, to be selected by Ms. Decker in consultation with Qatalyst Partners\nand based on the feedback received in the meeting. Following the meeting, based on Ms. Decker\u2019s\nconsultation with Qatalyst Partners, 11 financial sponsors (which included Financial Sponsor B and\nFinancial Sponsor D, but did not include STG) and 4 potential strategic acquirors (which did not include\nZendesk or Strategic A) were designated to engage with as part of the outreach process, in addition to\nFinancial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C.

On that day, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of $7.46 per share.\nBetween October 21, 2022 and October 25, 2022, in accordance with the directive of the Strategic\nCommittee, representatives of Qatalyst Partners commenced their outreach to the 15 designated additional\npotential counterparties. Over the subsequent two weeks, seven of the 15 additional counterparties entered\ninto a confidentiality agreement with Momentive, while eight of the additional counterparties did not enter into\na confidentiality agreement and declined to engage in discussions or due diligence with respect to a\npotential transaction with Momentive. In addition, Momentive requested at this time that each of Financial\nSponsor A and Financial Sponsor C enter into a new confidentiality agreement with Momentive in order to\nextend the term of their respective confidentiality obligations and because the \u201cstandstill\u201d provisions in their\noriginal confidentiality agreements had terminated upon the announcement of the Zendesk merger\nagreement. The new confidentiality agreement with Financial Sponsor C also included the portfolio company\nof Financial Sponsor C that was proposed as the entity that would acquire Momentive. All of these\nconfidentiality agreements described above, as well as the confidentiality agreements with the other\ncounterparties that made an unsolicited outreach to Momentive as described below, including the\nconfidentiality agreement subsequently entered into with STG, (1) contained \u201cstandstill\u201d provisions restricting\nthe counterparty from making public proposals with respect to the acquisition of Momentive without\nMomentive\u2019s prior consent (but not restricting confidential proposals to the Momentive Board), which\nrestrictions would terminate upon the occurrence of, among other things, Momentive\u2019s execution of a\ndefinitive agreement with a third party to acquire more than 50% of Momentive\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities\u037e and (2) restricted the counterparty\u2019s ability to engage with equity or debt financing sources\nregarding a potential transaction without Momentive\u2019s prior consent.

The representatives of Qatalyst Partners responded that they did not\nbelieve that such a valuation would lead to engagement by Momentive with Financial Sponsor D, which\nresponse was consistent with the feedback provided to Financial Sponsor C at the Strategic Committee\u2019s\ndirection. Following this discussion, Financial Sponsor D delivered a written, non-binding proposal to acquire\nMomentive at a price in cash of between $9.00 and $10.50 per share of Momentive common stock based on\npublicly available information.\nAlso beginning on October 25, 2022 and over the course of the subsequent four weeks, Momentive provided\npotential counterparties that had executed a confidentiality agreement, including the additional potential\ncounterparties that engaged with Momentive on an unsolicited basis following the initial outreach by\nQatalyst Partners, as described below, with access to a virtual data room to share operational and financial\ndue diligence information regarding Momentive.

The\nStrategic Committee also discussed with its advisors financing and closing certainty risks in STG\u2019s\nproposed transaction, and timing and process considerations of a transaction with STG. Following\ndiscussion, the Strategic Committee (1) determined to continue engaging with STG toward a potential\nacquisition, including by providing additional due diligence information, discussed STG\u2019s request to enter\ninto exclusive negotiations with STG with respect to a sale of Momentive, and declined to do so at this time,\nand instructed Qatalyst Partners as part of this engagement to inform STG that Momentive was prepared to\nproceed with discussions with respect to a potential transaction but that they were not prepared to transact\nat a price below $10.50 per share of Momentive common stock\u037e and (2) directed Qatalyst Partners to\ncontact to Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C to inform each of them that Momentive had\nreceived a credible acquisition proposal and offer an opportunity to submit a competing proposal. The\nStrategic Committee believed that Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C were the counterparties\npotentially most likely to be interested in, and capable of, submitting a competitive acquisition proposal. The\nStrategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of\nQatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters. Following the meeting, the Strategic Committee\nupdated the Momentive Board on the results of Momentive\u2019s solicitation process to date and next steps.\nBetween December 18 and 21, 2022, in accordance with the directive of the Strategic Committee,\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of STG to inform them that (1) Momentive\nwas prepared to proceed with discussions with respect to a potential transaction, including by providing\nadditional due diligence information, (2) was not prepared to agree to STG\u2019s request for exclusivity, and (3)\nwas not prepared to transact at price below $10.50 per share. Representatives of STG responded that it was\nprepared to move forward with additional diligence at $10.00 per share but could not commit to a higher\nprice. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners informed the members of the Strategic Committee of STG\u2019s\nresponse, including that STG indicated they were unable to commit to a higher price than $10.00 per share.\nThe Strategic Committee determined to proceed with discussions with STG on a non-exclusive basis,\ntoward a potential acquisition.\nOn December 20, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Financial Sponsor\nA to inform it that Momentive had received a credible acquisition proposal. Financial Sponsor A\nsubsequently declined again to engage in further discussions with Momentive regarding an acquisition.\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on December 20, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Financial\nSponsor C to inform them that Momentive had received a credible acquisition proposal.

The Strategic Committee discussed with its advisors (1) the execution risks presented by\nSTG\u2019s proposed transaction financing structure\u037e (2) the terms of the merger agreement and related\ntransaction documents as they related to financing and closing certainty\u037e and (3) Momentive\u2019s rights with\nrespect to the enforcement of the financing commitments and Momentive\u2019s remedies in the event of a\nfinancing failure. The Strategic Committee discussed the amount and terms of equity awards proposed to be\nissued by Momentive as part of its 2023 annual refresh grant prior to the closing, and other employee\ncompensation and retention matters, and how to optimize the possibility of obtaining an improved\nacquisition proposal from STG relative to employee retention and incentive objectives prior to the closing of a\npotential transaction and in the event a transaction was not ultimately consummated. Following discussion,\nthe Strategic Committee directed Qatalyst Partners, Wilson Sonsini and Momentive management to\ncontinue to negotiate the terms of the merger, including the acquisition price and the terms related to\nfinancing and closing certainty. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that Momentive should\npropose to issue a reduced amount of equity awards and retention bonuses to prior to the closing and seek\nan improved acquisition proposal from STG.\nLater on March 9, 2023, in accordance with the direction of the Strategic Committee, representatives of\nQatalyst Partners communicated to representatives of STG Momentive\u2019s proposed amount and terms of\nequity awards and retention bonuses to be issued by Momentive prior to the closing consistent with the\ndirection of the Strategic Committee and requested an improved acquisition proposal. In response, STG\nrequested to increase the amount of equity awards and retention bonuses to be issued by Momentive prior\nto closing for employee retention purposes but also indicated that, based on the proposed net reduction in\nthe amount of equity awards and retention bonuses to be issued, Parent would have the capacity to pay a\npurchase price of $9.45 in cash per share of Momentive common stock in an acquisition. Representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Wilson Sonsini also continued to negotiate the terms of the merger with\nrepresentatives of STG consistent with the direction of the Strategic Committee, including the conditions\nand other terms of the equity financing sources\u2019 obligations to complete their respective equity financing\ncommitments and the size of the Parent termination fee.\nStill later on March 9, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners noted to representatives of STG that,\nbased on their calculations of the sources and uses of funds in the merger and the reduction in the amount\nof equity awards and retention bonuses proposed by Momentive to be issued prior to the closing, Parent\nwould have the capacity to pay a purchase price of $9.46 per share of Momentive common stock in an\nacquisition. STG agreed with Qatalyst Partner\u2019s calculations, and orally increased its proposal to acquire\nMomentive at a purchase price of $9.46 in cash per share of Momentive common stock.\nOn March 10, 2023, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Members of Momentive\nmanagement presented an updated long-range plan for Momentive, including revisions relative to the draft\nplan presented at the prior meeting of the Momentive Board based on the feedback of the Momentive\ndirectors (which we refer to as the \u201cMarch 2023 long-range plan\u201d). Additional information about the\npreparation and substance of the March 2023 long-range plan is contained in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d The Momentive Board discussed the\nupdates to the long-range plan with members of Momentive management, including Momentive\nmanagement\u2019s increased confidence in the achievability of the results indicated by the March 2023 long-\nrange plan in the near-term and long-term in light of current and anticipated headwinds and trends in\nMomentive\u2019s industry and business. Following discussion, the Momentive Board approved the March 2023\nlong-range plan, including for purposes of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses, and authorized Qatalyst\nPartners to share a summary of the March 2023 long-range plan with STG. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners and representatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an update on the negotiations and discussions with\nSTG, including the status of Parent\u2019s efforts to secure financing commitments and the terms of Parent\u2019s\nfinancing commitments and Momentive\u2019s rights with respect thereto. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nnoted that, based on the amount of Parent\u2019s anticipated financing commitments and the estimated sources\nand uses of funds in the merger, Parent would not have the capacity to pay a purchase price of more than\n$9.46 in cash per share of Momentive common stock in an acquisition. The Momentive Board discussed\nwith\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wilson Sonsini potential Momentive stockholder reactions to the\nannouncement of the merger. The Momentive Board also met in executive session, without Momentive\nmanagement or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss these matters.\nFollowing discussion, the Momentive Board authorized representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst\nPartners and members of Momentive management to continue negotiating the terms of the merger with\nSTG. Following the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided STG with a summary of the\nMarch 2023 long-range plan.\nAlso on March 10, 2023, Momentive received a notice from a stockholder nominating a candidate for\nelection to the Momentive Board at Momentive\u2019s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders.\nOn March 11, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners reviewed the process to solicit proposals conducted by Momentive to date. Representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Wilson Sonsini provided an update on the negotiations and discussions with STG,\nincluding the status of Parent\u2019s efforts to secure financing commitments for the merger. In particular,\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini noted that the negotiation of the merger agreement and related transaction\ndocuments was substantially complete, in accordance with the terms previously discussed with the\nStrategic Committee and the Momentive Board, but that the execution of the merger agreement remained\nsubject to the finalization of Parent\u2019s financing commitments. The Strategic Committee discussed the\nimpact of contemporaneous events with respect to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and disruption in the\nU.S. banking sector on Parent\u2019s ability to finalize its financing commitments and execute the merger. The\nStrategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of\nQatalyst Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss these matters. Following discussion, the\nStrategic Committee directed representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Momentive management to finalize the\nforms of the merger agreement and confirm that Parent\u2019s financing commitments had been finalized. The\nStrategic Committee also determined to recommend to the Momentive Board that it adopt and approve the\nmerger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.\nOn March 12, 2023, representatives of STG communicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that, in\nlight of disruption in the U.S. banking sector and related uncertainty, certain members of the equity\ninvestment consortium and the debt financing sources would not be in a position to confirm their respective\nfinancing commitments until they observed the market reactions to these events on March 13, 2023, and\ntherefore Parent was not in a position to finalize and execute the merger agreement on March 12, 2023.\nLater on March 12, 2023, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners provided an update on the negotiations and discussions with STG, including the fact that Parent\u2019s\nfinancing commitments were not expected to be finalized that day. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nalso reviewed the process to solicit proposals conducted by Momentive to date, in which Momentive, with\nthe assistance of Qatalyst Partners, had engaged in discussions with 22 potential counterparties,\nconsisting of 18 financial sponsors and four potential strategic acquirors, 14 of which had entered into\nconfidentiality agreements with Momentive and conducted due diligence, and that had resulted only in the\nproposal from Parent at that time. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also presented to the Momentive\nBoard their financial analysis of the per share price and related financial aspects of the merger.\nRepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners indicated they would be prepared to deliver a written opinion, based on\nthe financial analysis presented at the meeting, that the per share price would be fair, from a financial point\nof view, to the Momentive stockholders if and when requested by the Momentive Board prior to the execution\nof the merger agreement within the next day. The Strategic Committee delivered its recommendation that\nthe Momentive Board adopt and approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement, including the merger. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of\nthe Momentive Board relevant Delaware law matters, including the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in connection\nwith the merger. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini also reviewed with the Momentive Board the principal\nterms of the merger agreement, the voting agreements, the equity commitment letter and the other\ntransaction documents. The Momentive Board also received from Qatalyst Partners an updated conflict\ndisclosure letter, from which the Momentive Board did not identify matters that would limit Qatalyst Partner\u2019s\nability to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to Momentive. In its review of the merger, the\nMomentive Board\n60\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconsidered various factors, including those described in the section titled \u201c-Momentive\u2019s Reasons for\nthe Merger and Recommendation of the Momentive Board of Directors.\u201d The Momentive Board directed\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Momentive management to finalize the forms of the merger agreement\nand related transaction documents.\nOn March 13, 2023, representatives of Paul Hastings provided representatives of Wilson Sonsini an updated\nversion of the debt commitment letter and related documents reflecting revised lending terms, and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Paul Hastings and members of Momentive management\nconfirmed that the forms of the merger agreement, voting agreements and related transaction documents\nwere final and that Parent had finalized its financing commitments for the merger.\nLater on March 13, 2023, during the trading and prior to the Momentive Board\u2019s approval of the merger\nagreement, upon the request of the Momentive Board, Qatalyst Partners delivered to the Momentive Board\nits written opinion, stating that based on conditions as of March 12, 2023 and the financial analysis\npresented to the Momentive Board on March 12, 2023, and based upon and subject to the various other\nassumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, that the per share price to be\nreceived pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger by the holders of Momentive common\nstock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The\nwritten opinion was revised by Qatalyst Partners following the execution of the merger agreement to be in\nthe form attached to this proxy statement as Annex B to correct a scrivener\u2019s error and to remove\nconfidential identifying information with respect to the members of the equity investment consortium.\nMomentive management also updated the Momentive Board on the discussions with STG and its\nrepresentatives.\nAfter the close of trading on March 13, 2023, the Momentive Board unanimously determined that the merger\nagreement and the merger are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Momentive and its\nstockholders, and declared advisable, adopted and approved in all respects the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and approved the execution and\ndelivery of the merger agreement, the voting agreements the other relevant transaction documents.\nStill later on March 13, 2023, the merger agreement, voting agreements and related transaction documents\nwere executed by the relevant parties, and Momentive publicly announced the merger and the execution of\nthe merger agreement.\nAlso on March 13, 2023, following the announcement of the merger, Momentive received a notice\nwithdrawing the nomination of a director candidate for election that had been submitted on March 10, 2023.",

            "text": "Recommendation of the Momentive Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Momentive Board\nOn March 13, 2023, the Momentive Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of\nMomentive and its stockholders\u037e (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by\nMomentive, the performance by Momentive of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the\nconsummation of the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein\u037e (3)\nrecommended that Momentive stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions\ncontemplated thereby\u037e and (4) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted for\nconsideration by Momentive stockholders at the special meeting.\nThe Momentive Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger\nagreement and approval of the merger\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation that will or may become payable by\nMomentive to its named executive officers in connection with the merger\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of\nthe special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit\nadditional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special\nmeeting.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Momentive Board consulted with Momentive\nmanagement, as well as representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners. In recommending\nthat Momentive stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger,\n61TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Momentive Board considered and analyzed a number of factors, including the following (which factors\nare not necessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based on these consultations, considerations\nand analyses, as well as the factors discussed below, the Momentive Board concluded that entering into the\nmerger agreement was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Momentive and its stockholders.\nThe Momentive Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination\nand recommendation:\n\u2022\nBusiness, Financial Condition, Prospects and Execution Risks. The Momentive Board considered\nthe current and historical financial condition, results of operations, business and competitive\npositioning of Momentive, as well as Momentive\u2019s prospects and risks if it were to remain an\npositioning of Momentive, as well as Momentive\u2019s prospects and risks if it were to remain an\nindependent company. In particular, the Momentive Board considered Momentive\u2019s then-current\nbusiness plan, including the March 2023 long-range plan. Additional information about the\npreparation and substance of the March 2023 long-range plan is contained in the section of this\nproxy statement captioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d The Momentive Board\nconsidered the March 2023 long-range plan and the potential opportunities that it presented\nagainst, among other things, various execution and other risks to achieving Momentive\u2019s business\nplan, including (1) the likelihood that the financial and operational results indicated by the March\n2023 long-range plan could be achieved in the face of operational and execution risks in the short\nand long term\u037e (2) the impact of market, industry, customer and competitive trends on, and\nheadwinds to, Momentive\u2019s business\u037e and (3) market volatility and the general risks related to\nmarket and industry conditions that could reduce the price of Momentive common stock. Among\nthe potential risks identified by the Momentive Board were:\n\u25cb\nMomentive\u2019s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included\namong these risks were consideration of (1) Momentive\u2019s size, as well as its\nfinancial resources, relative to those of its competitors\u037e (2) challenges to attracting and\nretaining sales-assisted and other customers, converting unpaid users to customers, and\ndeveloping and expanding relationships with customers\u037e (3) challenges to hiring and retaining\nkey personnel critical to the execution of Momentive\u2019s business plan\u037e (4) new and\nevolving competitive threats, particularly in light of relatively low barriers to entry into our\nbusiness\u037e and (5) other factors affecting the revenues, operating margin and profitability of\nMomentive and other companies in Momentive\u2019s industry generally and other risk factors\ndescribed in Momentive\u2019s other filings with the SEC, as listed in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\n\u25cb\nMomentive\u2019s continuing efforts to execute growth initiatives to (1) convert free users to paid\nsubscribers in its self-serve channel\u037e and (2) invest in product innovation and go-to-\nmarket initiatives to expand the percentage of Momentive\u2019s revenue generated through its\nsales-assisted channel. Although the Momentive Board believes that these actions are the\nright strategic decisions for Momentive, there is no assurance that they will be successful or\nresult in a more valuable company. In this regard, the Momentive Board was aware that\nMomentive\u2019s sales-assisted channel faced greater costs, longer sales cycles and less\npredictability in generating revenue than its self-serve channel.\n\u25cb\nRecent market volatility and evolving trends and headwinds facing Momentive\u2019s business and\nits industry more generally, including the impact of changed and uncertain\neconomic circumstances on key customer segments and the continuing effect of these\nfactors on Momentive and the execution of Momentive\u2019s plans as an independent public\ncompany.\n\u25cb\nMomentive\u2019s history of fluctuations in revenue growth and the challenges to maintaining\noperating margins in the near term, along with evolving investor expectations regarding\ngrowth and profitability at technology companies.\n\u25cb\nThe challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly\ntraded company, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance.\nThe Momentive Board was aware that the price of Momentive common stock could be\nnegatively impacted if Momentive failed to meet investor expectations, including if Momentive\nfailed to meet its growth or profitability objectives.\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u25cb\nThe inherent uncertainty of achieving the results reflected in the March 2023 long-range plan.\n\u25cb\nThe historical execution of Momentive\u2019s business plan and publicly disclosed guidance by\nMomentive management. In this regard, the Momentive Board was aware of instances in\nwhich Momentive failed to achieve certain expectations of Momentive\u2019s financial and\noperational performance, and of the impact that these failures had on the price of the\nMomentive common stock.\n\u25cb\nThe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of\nMomentive common stock.\n\u2022\nResults of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of a comprehensive strategic\nreview process overseen by the Strategic Committee. The Momentive Board considered that, with\nthe assistance of Qatalyst Partners, Momentive contacted four potential strategic acquirors and 18\nfinancial sponsors (including STG) concerning their interest in a strategic transaction involving\nMomentive. The Momentive Board considered the nature of the engagement by each of these\npotential acquirors, and that, of these potential acquirors, only STG made a proposal for an\nacquisition of Momentive that was capable of being accepted. The Momentive Board was also\naware that the 2021 solicitation process had attracted considerable media attention and made\nclear that the Momentive Board would consider a potential sale of Momentive and other transaction\nthat maximized stockholder value. Further, the Momentive Board noted that media reports that\nMomentive was pursuing a potential sale prompted numerous unsolicited expressions of interest in\npursuing a potential acquisition of Momentive, but that none of these expressions of interest had\nresulted in a proposal that was capable of being accepted.\n\u2022\nCash Consideration and Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by Momentive\nstockholders in the merger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty of value measured\nagainst the ongoing business and financial execution risks of Momentive\u2019s business plan. The\nreceipt of cash consideration eliminates uncertainty and risk for Momentive stockholders related to\nthe continued execution of Momentive\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nBest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Momentive Board that the per share price\nrepresents the best value reasonably obtainable for the shares of Momentive common stock, taking\ninto account the Momentive Board\u2019s familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business\nstrategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of Momentive on a historical and\nprospective basis. In addition, the Momentive Board believed that, measured against Momentive\u2019s\nlonger-term execution risks, the per share price reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of\nMomentive common stock. The Momentive Board also considered that the per share price\nconstitutes a premium of approximately 28 percent to the volume weighted average closing price of\nMomentive stock for the 10 trading days ending on March 13, 2023, the date the merger agreement\nwas executed, and a 46 percent premium to Momentive\u2019s closing stock price on October 18, 2022,\nthe day prior to media rumors regarding a potential sale. The Momentive Board also considered\nthat the per share price represented the highest price that STG said Parent was capable of paying\nin an acquisition of Momentive.\n\u2022\nPotential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Momentive Board that none of the possible\nalternatives to the merger (including the possibility of continuing to operate Momentive as an\nindependent public company or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived\nrisks of those alternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to Momentive stockholders of\nthose alternatives and the timing and likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely\nto present superior opportunities for Momentive to create greater value for Momentive stockholders,\ntaking into account execution risks as well as business, competitive, financial, industry, legal,\nmarket and regulatory risks.\n\u2022\nFairness Opinion of Qatalyst Partners. The written opinion of Qatalyst Partners delivered to the\nMomentive Board, stating that based on conditions as of March 12, 2023 and the financial analysis\npresented to the Momentive Board on March 12, 2023, and based upon and subject to the various\nother assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, that the per share\nprice to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger by the holders of\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMomentive common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) is fair, from a financial point\nof view, to such holders. The opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP\u201d and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B\nto this proxy statement.\n\u2022\nNegotiations with Parent and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the merger agreement\nand related transaction documents, which were the product of arms\u2019-length negotiations, and the\nbelief of the Momentive Board that these agreements contained terms that provided Momentive with\na high level of closing certainty. The factors considered included:\n\u25cb\nMomentive\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct\nnegotiations with, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.\n\u25cb\nThe Momentive Board\u2019s belief that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to\ndeter third parties from making a superior proposal.\n\u25cb\nThe Momentive Board\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its\nrecommendation that Momentive stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement.\n\u25cb\nMomentive\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement to enter\ninto an alternative acquisition agreement. In that regard, the Momentive Board believed that the\ntermination fee payable by Momentive in such instance was reasonable, consistent\nwith similar fees payable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.\n\u25cb\nThe limited conditions to Parent\u2019s obligation to consummate the merger, making the merger\nreasonably likely to be consummated.\n\u25cb\nParent\u2019s obligations under the merger agreement to complete the equity financing and debt\nfinancing necessary to fund the merger. \n\u25cb\nThe limited conditions to the obligations of the investment consortium led by STG to fund their\nrespective equity financing commitments under the equity commitment letter.\n\u25cb\nMomentive\u2019s recourse in the event of a financing failure, including Momentive\u2019s ability (1) to\nspecifically enforce Parent\u2019s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded or\nto specifically enforce the equity financing commitments directly under the equity\ncommitment letter in the circumstances specified in the merger agreement and the equity\ncommitment letter\u037e or (2) to collect the Parent termination fee in the circumstances specified\nin the merger agreement and the Limited Guaranty. In that regard, the Momentive Board\nbelieved that the Parent termination fee, which was guaranteed by funds affiliated with STG,\nwas consistent with similar fees payable in comparable transactions.\n\u2022\nReasonable Likelihood of Consummation. The belief of the Momentive Board that an acquisition by\nParent has a reasonable likelihood of closing, including the Momentive Board\u2019s belief that there\nwas a reasonable likelihood that the regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger\nwould be obtained.\n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to Momentive\nstockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of Momentive common stock) who timely and\nproperly exercise such appraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.\nThe Momentive Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative\nfactors related to its recommendation, including the following:\n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the merger as a cash\ntransaction means that Momentive stockholders will not participate in Momentive\u2019s future earnings\nor growth and will not benefit from any appreciation in value of the surviving corporation following the\nmerger, whether as an independent company or in combination with other STG portfolio companies\nor assets. The Momentive Board also considered the other potential alternative strategies available\nto Momentive as an independent company, which, despite significant uncertainty, had the potential\nto result in a more successful and valuable company.\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nNo Ability to Solicit an Alternative Transaction. The restrictions in the merger agreement on\nMomentive\u2019s ability to solicit competing proposals from the date of the merger agreement (subject\nto certain exceptions to allow the Momentive Board to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a\nsuperior proposal, and then only upon the payment of the termination fee described below).\n\u2022\nFinancing Risks. The need for Parent to obtain debt financing, and equity financing from a\nconsortium of co-investors, in order to complete the merger. In that regard, the Momentive Board\nwas aware that Parent\u2019s need to obtain equity financing commitments from a consortium of co-\ninvestors could give rise to a greater possibility of a financing failure.\n\u2022\nTermination Fee Payable by Momentive. The requirement that Momentive pay Parent a termination\nfee of $52.0 million under certain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement,\nincluding if the Momentive Board terminates the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal.\nThe Momentive Board considered the potentially dampening effect that this termination fee could\nhave on a third party\u2019s interest in making a proposal to acquire Momentive.\n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the merger might not\nbe consummated, and, if it is not consummated, that: (1) Momentive\u2019s directors, senior\nmanagement and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have\nexperienced significant distractions from their work on behalf of Momentive during the pendency of\nthe merger\u037e (2) Momentive will have incurred significant transaction and other costs\u037e (3)\nMomentive\u2019s continuing business relationships with customers, business partners and employees\nmay be adversely affected\u037e (4) the trading price of Momentive common stock could be adversely\naffected\u037e (5) the other contractual and legal remedies available to Momentive in the event of the\ntermination of the merger agreement may be insufficient, costly to pursue or both\u037e and (6) the\nfailure of the merger to be consummated could result in an adverse perception among Momentive\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective customers, employees and investors, which could cause an adverse\nimpact on Momentive\u2019s operating results. In this regard, the Momentive Board was aware of the\nsignificant impact of the failure of the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement on Momentive\nand its business.\n\u2022\nParent Liability Limitation. The fact that Parent\u2019s liability for monetary damages under the merger\nagreement are limited to the Parent liability limitation, which amount may not be sufficient to\ncompensate Momentive for the adverse impacts of the failure of the merger to be consummated.\n\u2022\nImpact of Interim Restrictions on Momentive\u2019s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger.\nThe restrictions on Momentive\u2019s conduct of its business prior to the consummation of the merger,\nwhich may delay or prevent Momentive from undertaking strategic initiatives before the completion\nof the merger that, absent the merger agreement, Momentive might have pursued.\n\u2022\nEffects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the merger,\nincluding the: (1) effects on Momentive\u2019s employees, customers, operating results and stock price\u037e\n(2) impact on Momentive\u2019s ability to attract and retain management, sales and marketing and\ntechnical personnel\u037e and (3) potential for litigation in connection with the merger.\n\u2022\nTaxable Consideration. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Momentive common stock in\nthe merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for many Momentive\nstockholders.\n\u2022\nInterests of Momentive\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers. Interests that Momentive\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers may have in the merger, which may be different from, or in addition to, those of\nMomentive other stockholders.\nThis discussion is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it summarizes the material reasons and factors\nevaluated by the Momentive Board in its consideration of the merger. After considering these and other\nfactors, the Momentive Board concluded that the potential benefits of entering into the merger agreement\noutweighed the uncertainties and risks. In light of the variety of factors considered by the Momentive Board\nand the complexity of these factors, the Momentive Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify\nor otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination and\nrecommendations. Moreover, each member of the Momentive Board applied his or her own personal\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbusiness judgment to the process and may have assigned different relative weights to the different factors.\nThe Momentive Board adopted and approved the merger agreement and the merger, and recommended that\nMomentive stockholders adopt the merger agreement, based upon the totality of the information presented\nto, and considered by, the Momentive Board. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above\nmay contain forward-looking statements, which should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d",

        "Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP": {
            "text": "Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP\nMomentive retained Qatalyst Partners to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential\ntransaction such as the merger and to evaluate whether the per share price of $9.46 to be received pursuant\nto, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Momentive\ncommon stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nholders. Momentive selected Qatalyst Partners to act as Momentive\u2019s financial advisor based on Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which Momentive operates and experience\nadvising technology companies in connection with potential strategic transactions. Qatalyst Partners has\nprovided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the\nMomentive Board on March 12, 2023, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Momentive Board its valuation\nanalysis and stated that Qatalyst Partners was prepared to render a financial opinion to the Momentive\nBoard based on that analysis, if asked to do so. Upon request of the Momentive Board the following day,\nduring the trading and prior to the Momentive Board\u2019s approval of the merger agreement, Qatalyst Partners\ndelivered its written opinion, dated March 13, 2023, to the Board of Directors, to the effect that, based on\nconditions as of March 12, 2023 and the financial analysis presented to the Momentive Board on March 12,\n2023, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters\nset forth therein, the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of\nthe merger agreement by the holders of shares of Momentive common stock (other than Parent or any\naffiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For more information on the\ndelivery of the opinion by Qatalyst Partners to the Momentive Board, please see the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201c-Background of the Merger.\u201d\nThe full text of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 written opinion, dated March 13, 2023, is attached hereto as\nAnnex B and is incorporated by reference herein. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of\nthe review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. The Momentive stockholders\nshould read the opinion carefully in its entirety. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion was provided to the\nMomentive Board and addresses only, based upon and subject to the various other assumptions,\nqualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein,, the fairness, from a financial point of\nview, of the per share price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the\nmerger agreement by the holders of shares of Momentive common stock (other than Parent or any\naffiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the merger. It does\nnot constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Momentive common stock\nshould vote with respect to the merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address\nthe price at which Momentive common stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the\nopinion, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the merger agreement, certain related\ndocuments and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of\nMomentive. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the March 2023 long-range plan and the March 2023\nextrapolations prepared by Momentive management (which is referred to in this section of the proxy\nstatement, collectively, as the \u201cMomentive Projections\u201d), described in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past\nand current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Momentive with senior management of\nMomentive. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Momentive\ncommon stock and compared the financial performance of Momentive and the prices and trading activity of\nMomentive common stock with that of certain other selected publicly traded companies and their securities.\nIn addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected\n66TABLE OF CONTENTS\nacquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and\nconsidered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the\naccuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made\navailable to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Momentive. With respect to the Momentive\nProjections, Qatalyst Partners was advised by Momentive management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed\nbased on discussions with Momentive management and the Momentive Board, that the Momentive\nProjections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and\njudgments of Momentive management of the future financial performance of Momentive and other matters\ncovered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the terms of the draft merger agreement reviewed by\nQatalyst Partners would not differ materially from the final executed merger agreement, and that the merger\nwill be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without any\nmodification, waiver or delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of\nall the necessary approvals of the merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed\nthat could have an adverse effect on Momentive or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the\nmerger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities\n(contingent or otherwise) of Momentive or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such\nevaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent verification, upon the\nassessment of Momentive management as to the existing and future technology and products of Momentive\nand the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion has been approved\nby its opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in\neffect on, and the information made available to it as of, March 12, 2023. Events occurring after March 12,\n2023 may affect Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners\nhas not been asked and has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Momentive to engage in the merger,\nor the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to\nMomentive. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per\nshare price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the\nholders of shares of Momentive common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), and Qatalyst\nPartners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to\nany of the officers, directors or employees of Momentive or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons,\nrelative to such consideration.\nThe following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with\nits opinion dated March 13, 2023. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a\nwhole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors,\ncould create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion. For\npurposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners utilized, among other things, the Momentive Projections,\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Certain Unaudited Prospective Information.\u201d\nSome of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables\nare not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by\nQatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data\nset forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the\nmethodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a\nrange of potential per-share present values for Momentive common stock as of December 31, 2022 (which is\nthe end of Momentive\u2019s most recent completed fiscal year and most recent balance sheet date) by:\n\u2022\nadding:\n\u25cb\nthe implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows excluding the\nimpact of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, non-recurring expenses, \n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand other non-cash items (which are referred to as the \u201cUFCF\u201d) of Momentive, based on the\nMomentive Projections for calendar year 2023 through calendar year 2031 (which implied\npresent value was calculated using a range of discount rates of 12.0 percent to 14.5 percent,\nbased on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for Momentive)\u037e\n\u25cb\nthe implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Momentive, calculated by\nmultiplying Momentive\u2019s estimated UFCF in calendar year 2032 of approximately $225\nmillion (excluding the effect of Momentive\u2019s estimated remaining research and development\ntax credits for calendar year 2032 of approximately $12 million, as such tax attributes\nwere separately valued, as described in the second succeeding bullet point below), based on\nthe Momentive Projections, by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to next-12-\nmonths\u2019 estimated UFCF multiples of 10.0x to 15.0x (which were chosen based on Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 professional judgment), and discounted to present value using the same range of\ndiscount rates used in the first bullet above\u037e\n\u25cb\nthe cash and cash equivalents of Momentive as of December 31, 2022, as provided by\nMomentive management\u037e\n\u25cb\nthe implied net present value of Momentive\u2019s estimated federal tax savings due to its\nremaining research and development tax credits for calendar year 2032 (as provided by\nMomentive\u2019s management), discounted to present value using the same range of discount\nrates used in the first bullet above\u037e and\n\u2022\nsubtracting:\n\u25cb\nthe principal amount of Momentive\u2019s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022, as provided\nby Momentive management\u037e and\n\u2022\ndividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Momentive common stock\noutstanding (calculated using the treasury stock method), which takes into account outstanding\nstock options and restricted stock units as of March 10, 2023, all as provided by Momentive\nmanagement, with each of the above-referenced estimated future UFCFs, terminal value and federal\ntax savings due to remaining research and development tax credits for calendar year 2032 having\nalso been adjusted for the degree of estimated dilution to current stockholders through each\nrespective applicable period (which totaled approximately 37 percent in the case of the terminal\nvalue) due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations related to future\nequity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Momentive management.\nBased on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for Momentive common\nstock of approximately $7.52 to $10.48 per share.\nSelected Companies Analysis\nQatalyst Partners reviewed and compared selected financial information and public market multiples for\nMomentive with publicly available financial information and public market multiples for selected companies.\nThe companies used in this comparison were those companies listed below, which were selected by\nQatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded\ncompanies in similar lines of business to Momentive, have a similar business model, have similar financial\nperformance or have other relevant or similar characteristics.\nBased upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates as of March 10, 2023 (which are referred to\nas the \u201cAnalyst Projections\u201d) and using the closing prices as of March 10, 2023 for shares of the selected\ncompanies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the fully diluted enterprise value divided by\nthe estimated consensus revenue for calendar year 2023 (which are referred to as the \u201cCY2023E revenue\nmultiples\u201d), for each of the selected companies.\nBased upon the Analyst Projections and using the closing prices as of March 10, 2023 for shares of the\nselected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the fully diluted equity value divided\nby the estimated consensus levered free cash flow for calendar year 2023 (which are referred to as the\n\u201cCY2023E LFCF multiples\u201d) for each of the selected companies.\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe companies used in this comparison are listed below:\nSelected Companies\nCY2023E \nRevenue\nMultiple\nCY2023E \nLFCF \nMultiple*\nXM Peers\n \n

the application of\nits professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 2.0x to 3.5x.\nQatalyst Partners then applied this range to each of Momentive\u2019s estimated revenue for calendar year 2023:\n$489 million based on the Momentive Projections, and $495 million based on the Analyst Projections.\nBased on the fully diluted shares of Momentive common stock outstanding as of March 10, 2023 (calculated\nutilizing the same methodology as used in the above section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Discounted\nCash Flow Analysis\u201d). This analysis implied a range of values for Momentive common stock of\napproximately $6.32 to $10.96 per share based on the Momentive Projections and approximately $6.40 to\n$11.10 per share based on the Analyst Projections.\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E LFCF multiples for each of the selected companies and the\napplication of its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 10.0x\nto 15.0x.\nQatalyst Partners then applied this range to each of Momentive\u2019s estimated levered free cash flow for\ncalendar year 2023: $78 million based on the Management Projections, and $88 million based on the\nAnalyst Projections. Based on the fully diluted shares of Momentive common stock outstanding as of March\n10, 2023 (calculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\u201d).This analysis implied a range of values for Momentive common\nstock of approximately $4.96 to $7.44 per share based on the Momentive Projections and approximately\n$5.57 to $8.35 per share based on the Analyst Projections.\nNo company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Momentive. In evaluating the\nselected companies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry\nperformance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these\nmatters are beyond the control of Momentive, such as the impact of competition on Momentive\u2019s business\nand the industry in general, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in Momentive\u2019s\nfinancial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Individual multiples or\nmathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself\na meaningful method of using selected company data.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nQatalyst Partners compared seven selected public company transactions announced since 2011 that had a\ndeal value of more than $1 billion, including transactions involving companies participating in similar lines of\nbusiness to Momentive or with similar business models, similar financial performance or other relevant or\nsimilar characteristics.\nFor each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (1) the\nimplied fully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of last-12-months\u2019 revenue of the\n69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntarget company (which are referred to as the \u201cLTM revenue multiples\u201d), (2) the implied fully diluted enterprise\nvalue of the target company as a multiple of the Analyst Projections of the next-12-months\u2019 revenue of the\ntarget company (which are referred to as the \u201cNTM revenue multiples\u201d) and (3) the implied fully diluted equity\nvalue of the target company as a multiple of the Analyst Projections of the next-12-months levered free cash\nflow of the target company (which are referred to as the \u201cNTM LFCF multiples\u201d).\nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nLTM \nRevenue\nMultiple\nNTM \nRevenue\nMultiple\nNTM \nLFCF \nMultiple*\n10/27/22\nUserTesting, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\n6.2x\n5.3x\n-\n08/05/21\nCornerstone OnDemand, Inc.

Based on the fully diluted shares of Momentive common stock outstanding as of March 10, 2023\ncalculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\u201d), as provided by Momentive management, this analysis implied a range of\nvalues for Momentive common stock of approximately $8.04 to $19.08 per share.\nBased on an analysis of the NTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional\njudgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 2.3x to 5.9x and then applied this\nrange to Momentive\u2019s estimated next-12-months\u2019 revenue (calculated as the 12-month period ending\nDecember 31, 2023) based on the Analyst Projections. Based on the same fully diluted share count as\nused in the immediately preceding paragraph, this analysis implied a range of values for Momentive common\nstock of approximately $7.34 to $18.44 per share.\nBased on an analysis of the NTM LFCF multiples for the selected transactions and its professional\njudgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 13.1x to 27.5x then applied this\nrange to Momentive\u2019s estimated next-12-months\u2019 levered free cash flow (calculated as the 12-month period\nending December 31, 2023) based on the Analyst Projections. Based on the same fully diluted share count\ncalculation as used for the analysis utilizing LTM revenue multiples above, this analysis implied a range of\nvalues for Momentive common stock of approximately $7.30 to $15.23 per share.\nNo company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Momentive or the\nmerger. In evaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with\nregard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other\nmatters, many of which are beyond Momentive\u2019s control, such as the impact of competition on Momentive\u2019s\nbusiness or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in\nMomentive\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which\ncould affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which\nthey are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic\nmean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected transactional data.\nBecause of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the merger, Qatalyst Partners\ncautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.\nMiscellaneous\nIn connection with the review of the merger by the Momentive Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety\nof financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nopinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all its analyses as a whole and did not\nattribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that\nselecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading\nor incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may\nhave given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have\ndeemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of\nvaluations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 view of the actual value of Momentive. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made\nnumerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and\nfinancial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Momentive. Any estimates\ncontained in Qatalyst Partners\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nQatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness,\nfrom a financial point of view, of the per share price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the\nterms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Momentive common stock (other than Parent or\nany affiliate of Parent), to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price\nat which Momentive common stock might actually trade at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and its presentation to the Momentive Board was one of many factors considered\nby the Momentive Board in deciding to approve the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses as\ndescribed above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Momentive Board with respect\nto the per share price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger\nagreement by the holders of shares of Momentive common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of\nParent) or of whether the Momentive Board would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. The\nper share price payable in the merger was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Momentive\nand Parent and was approved by the Momentive Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Momentive\nduring these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to\nMomentive or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,\ndomestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of\nthese activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade\nor otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Momentive, Parent or certain of their\nrespective affiliates. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed\nbetween Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company, Parent, Symphony Technology Group or\nthe other equity co-investors of Parent, or their respective affiliates, pursuant to which compensation was\nreceived by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except that Qatalyst Partners acted as a financial advisor to\nthe Company in connection with certain shareholder activism and governance matters. Qatalyst Partners\nand/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to Momentive or\nParent and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst Partners would expect to receive compensation.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided Momentive with financial\nadvisory services in connection with the merger for which it will be paid an aggregate amount\ncurrently estimated at approximately $19 million, $3 million of which was payable upon delivery\nof its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), $2 million of which was\npayable for services previously rendered and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon,\nand subject to, the closing of the merger. Momentive has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst\nPartners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. Momentive has also agreed to\nindemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers,\npartners, agents and employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its\naffiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, and\ncertain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 engagement.\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information",

However, Momentive management regularly prepares, and the Momentive Board regularly\nevaluates prospective financial information as to Momentive\u2019s future performance as part of its resource\nplanning and long-term business planning processes. Momentive management regularly makes and reviews\nwith the Momentive Board updates to its business plan, including to reflect actual results and trends and\nchanges in Momentive\u2019s performance and the industry in which it operates.\nDuring the period in which it was engaged in discussions with STG and certain other parties with respect to\na potential transaction, and as part of Momentive\u2019s strategic planning process and evaluation of strategic\nalternatives (including continuing as an independent company), Momentive management prepared and\nreviewed with the Strategic Committee and the Momentive Board various unaudited forward-looking financial\ninformation, including the unaudited prospective financial information summarized below. The tables below\nsummarize the (1) unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 included in\nthe long-term business plan for Momentive reviewed with, and approved by, the Momentive Board on April 8,\n2022 (which financial information is referred to as the \u201cApril 2022 long-range plan\u201d)\u037e (2) unaudited\nprospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 included in the long-term business plan\nfor Momentive reviewed with, and approved by, the Momentive Board on November 9, 2022 (which financial\ninformation is referred to as the \u201cNovember 2022 long-range plan\u201d)\u037e and (3) unaudited prospective\nfinancial information for fiscal years 2023 through 2026 included in the long-term business plan for\nMomentive as updated by Momentive management as of, and reviewed with and approved by the Momentive\nBoard on, March 10, 2023 (which financial information is referred to as the \u201cMarch 2023 long-range plan\u201d),\ntogether with extrapolations of such unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2027 through\n2032 prepared by Momentive management and reviewed with the Momentive Board on March 10, 2023\n(which extrapolations are referred to as the \u201cMarch 2023 extrapolations\u201d). For purposes of this proxy\nstatement, we refer to the April 2022, November 2022 long-range plan, the March 2023 long-range plan and\nthe March 2023 extrapolations, collectively, as the \u201cunaudited prospective financial information.\u201d\nThe unaudited prospective financial information was prepared for internal use and not for public disclosure\nand was provided by Momentive management to the Strategic Committee and the Momentive Board for the\npurposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the merger and other strategic alternatives available to\nMomentive. At the direction of the Momentive Board, the March 2023 long-range plan and the March 2023\nextrapolations were also provided to, and approved by the Momentive Board for use by, Qatalyst Partners for\npurposes of performing its financial analyses in connection with rendering its opinion to the Momentive\nBoard. Qatalyst Partners was advised by Momentive management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based\non discussions with Momentive management and the Momentive Board, that the March 2023 long-range\nplan and the March 2023 extrapolations had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently\navailable estimates and judgments of Momentive management of the future financial performance of\nMomentive and other matters covered thereby. In addition, as described in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cBackground of the Merger,\u201d at the direction of the Strategic Committee and the\nMomentive Board, (1) a summary of the April 2022 long-range plan was provided to Financial Sponsor A on\nApril 18, 2022, (2) a summary of November 2022 long-range plan was provided to STG on November 18,\n2022 and to certain other potential counterparties to a potential strategic transaction involving Momentive in\nOctober and November 2022, and (3) a summary of the March 2023 long-range plan was provided to STG on\nMarch 10, 2023, in each case as part of Momentive\u2019s discussions with those parties with respect to a\npotential transaction and to assist in their respective due diligence review. For more information on the\npreparation and use of the unaudited prospective financial information, please see the sections of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cBackground of the Merger\u201d and \u201cOpinion of Qatalyst Partners LP.\u201d\nThe unaudited prospective financial information was developed by Momentive management as then-current\nestimates of Momentive\u2019s future financial performance as an independent company. The unaudited\nprospective financial information does not give effect to the merger, including any impact of the negotiation or\nexecution of the merger agreement or the merger, the expenses that have already and will be incurred in\nconnection with completing the merger, or any changes to Momentive\u2019s operations or strategy that may be\nimplemented in connection with the pendency of, or following the consummation of, the merger. The\nunaudited prospective financial information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the merger to\nbe completed\u037e it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\n72\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe unaudited prospective financial information constitutes forward-looking statements. The unaudited\nprospective financial information is not included in this proxy statement to influence any decision on whether\nto vote for the merger proposal or any other proposal presented at the special meeting, but rather is included\nin this proxy statement to give stockholders access to certain non-public information that was provided to\nthe Strategic Committee, the Momentive Board and Qatalyst Partners for the purposes described above, as\nwell as to STG and certain other potential counterparties to a potential strategic transaction involving\nMomentive. By including the unaudited prospective financial information in this proxy statement, none of\nMomentive, the Strategic Committee, the Momentive Board, Qatalyst Partners or any person has made or\nmakes any representation to any person regarding Momentive\u2019s ultimate performance as compared to the\ninformation contained in the unaudited prospective financial information. The inclusion of the unaudited\nprospective financial information should not be regarded as an indication that Momentive, the Strategic\nCommittee, the Momentive Board or Qatalyst Partners or any other person considered, or now considers,\nthem to be necessarily predictive of actual future results, and such information should not be relied on as\nsuch. Further, the inclusion of the unaudited prospective financial information in this proxy statement does\nnot constitute an admission or representation by Momentive that the information presented is material.\nThere can be no assurance that the prospective results will be realized or that actual results of Momentive\nwill not be materially lower or higher than estimated. The unaudited prospective financial information has not\nbeen updated or revised to reflect information or results either as of or after the date of this proxy statement.\nMomentive has, and may continue to, report results of operations for periods included in the unaudited\nprospective financial information that were or will be completed following the preparation of the unaudited\nprospective financial information. Stockholders and investors are urged to refer to Momentive\u2019s periodic\nfilings with the SEC for information on Momentive\u2019s actual historical results.\nThe unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or\ncomplying with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d). In addition, the\nunaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published\nguidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The unaudited prospective\nfinancial information included in this proxy statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of,\nMomentive\u2019s management. Momentive\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP,\nhas not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the\nunaudited prospective financial information and, accordingly, they do not express an opinion or any other\nform of assurance with respect thereto. The Ernst & Young LLP report incorporated by reference in this\nproxy statement relates solely to Momentive\u2019s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to\nthe unaudited prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.\nAlthough the unaudited prospective financial information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects\nnumerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by Momentive management that Momentive\nmanagement believed in good faith were reasonable at the time the unaudited prospective financial\ninformation was prepared, including with respect to (1) market, industry, customer and competitive trends in\nMomentive\u2019s business and industry\u037e (2) growth rates for Momentive\u2019s revenues in self-serve and sales-\nassisted channels\u037e (3) personnel, research and development and other operating expenses\u037e (4) operating\nmargins\u037e and (5) other relevant operating and financial measures. Momentive\u2019s ability to achieve the financial\nresults contemplated by the unaudited prospective financial information will be affected by Momentive\u2019s\nability to achieve its strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods, and will be subject to\noperational and execution risks associated therewith. The unaudited prospective financial information\nreflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important factors that\nmay affect actual results and cause the unaudited prospective financial information not to be achieved can\nbe found in the risk factors included in Momentive\u2019s periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are\ndifficult to predict, and many of them are outside of Momentive\u2019s control. As a result, there can be no\nassurance that the unaudited prospective financial information will be realized, and Momentive\u2019s actual\nresults may be materially better or worse than those contained in the unaudited prospective financial\ninformation. For information on factors that may cause Momentive\u2019s future results to materially vary, see the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d The unaudited prospective\nfinancial information may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts. You should evaluate the\nunaudited prospective financial information, if at all, in conjunction with Momentive\u2019s historical financial\nstatements and other\n73\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninformation regarding Momentive contained in Momentive\u2019s public filings with the SEC. The unaudited\nprospective financial information may not be consistent with Momentive\u2019s historical operating data as a\nresult of the assumptions utilized in preparing such information. Except to the extent required by applicable\nfederal securities laws, Momentive do not intend to update or otherwise revise the unaudited prospective\nfinancial information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such information was prepared or to\nreflect the occurrence of future events.\nBecause the unaudited prospective financial information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible\nto sensitivities and assumptions, as well as to multiple interpretations based on actual experience and\nbusiness developments. The unaudited prospective financial information also covers multiple years, and\nsuch information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The unaudited\nprospective financial information is not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating\nresults. Further, the unaudited prospective financial information is not fact and should not be relied upon as\nbeing necessarily indicative of Momentive\u2019s future results or for purposes of making any investment decision.\nCertain of the financial measures included in the unaudited prospective financial information are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures (which we refer to as the \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d). These are financial\nperformance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from\nsimilarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations\ninherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be\nincluded in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered\ntogether with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Financial\nmeasures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a\nbusiness combination transaction, such as the unaudited prospective financial information, are excluded\nfrom the definition of \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a\nresult, the unaudited prospective financial information is not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of\nnon-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided\nto or relied upon by the Strategic Committee, the Momentive Board, Qatalyst Partners, or any other person.\nAccordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the unaudited prospective financial\ninformation is provided in this proxy statement.\nThe following table presents a summary of the April 2022 long-range plan.\n \nFiscal year ending December 31\n(dollars in millions)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\nRevenue\n$500\n$575\n$677\n$802\n$959\nNon-GAAP Operating Income (1)\n$ 35\n$ 72\n$115\n$164\n$220\n \n(1)\nNon-GAAP Operating Income is defined as GAAP income (loss) from operations excluding stock-based compensation, net,\namortization of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction costs, and restructuring.\nThe following table presents a summary of the November 2022 long-range plan.\n \nFiscal year ending December 31\n(dollars in millions)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\nRevenue\n$480\n$519\n$594\n$692\n$807\nNon-GAAP Operating Income (1)\n$ 34\n$ 82\n$128\n$157\n$196\n \n(1)\nNon-GAAP Operating Income is defined as GAAP income (loss) from operations excluding stock-based compensation, net,\namortization of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction costs, and restructuring.\n74\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table presents a summary of the March 2023 long-range plan, together with the March 2023\nextrapolations.

Unlevered Free Cash Flow excludes the impact of stock-based\ncompensation. The March 2023 long-range plan included an estimate of Momentive\u2019s Levered Free Cash Flow for 2023 in\nthe amount of $78 million, which estimate was prepared by Momentive management and used by Qatalyst Partners in\nconnection with its financial analyses for the purpose of rendering its opinion to the Momentive Board. Levered Free Cash\nFlow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by or used in operating activities, subtracting purchases of property and\nequipment and capitalized internal-use software and does not include the impact of estimated principal debt repayments.",

            "text": "Interests of Momentive\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Momentive Board that you vote to approve the proposal to\nadopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that Momentive\u2019s directors and executive officers may\nhave interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Momentive\u2019s\nstockholders. Additionally, concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Momentive\u2019s directors,\nin their capacities as Momentive stockholders, entered into the voting agreements with Parent and\nMomentive. The voting agreements obligate these persons to vote their respective shares of Momentive\ncommon stock (1) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and any action in furtherance of the\nadoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) against any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected\nto result in a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Momentive in the\nmerger agreement\u037e and (3) against any proposal involving Momentive or any of its subsidiaries that would\nreasonably be expected to have a Momentive material adverse effect (as defined in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Representations and Warranties\u201d) or materially impede,\ninterfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the consummation of the merger or any of the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger\nagreement\u037e (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger\u037e and (3) recommending that the merger\nagreement be adopted by Momentive\u2019s stockholders, the Momentive Board was aware of and considered\nthese interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests are more\nfully described below.\nInsurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directors and officers of Momentive will be entitled to certain\nongoing indemnification and insurance coverage, including under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance\npolicies. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-\nIndemnification and Insurance.\u201d\nTreatment of Equity Awards\nTreatment of Momentive RSUs\nAs of April 5, 2023, there were outstanding awards of Momentive RSUs (or portions thereof) that cover an\naggregate of 10,159,110 shares of Momentive common stock, of which Momentive RSUs covering an\naggregate of 66,182 shares of Momentive common stock were held by Momentive\u2019s current non-employee\ndirectors and of which Momentive RSUs covering an aggregate of 1,560,069 shares of Momentive common\nstock were held by Momentive\u2019s current executive officers.\n75TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt the effective time of the merger, each vested Momentive RSU will be cancelled and converted into the\nright to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive\ncommon stock subject to such vested Momentive RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable\nwithholding taxes.\nAt the effective time of the merger, each unvested Momentive RSU will be cancelled and converted into the\ncontingent right to receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive\ncommon stock subject to such unvested Momentive RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less\napplicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such converted\ncash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions as applied\nto the corresponding unvested Momentive RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, with\npayment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.\nFor more information regarding the treatment of Momentive RSUs held by Momentive\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cInterests of Momentive\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger-Change in Control and Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships.\u201d\nTreatment of Momentive Restricted Stock\nAs of April 5, 2023, there were 809,314 of shares of Momentive common stock subject to outstanding\nMomentive restricted stock awards, none of which were held by Momentive\u2019s current non-employee directors\nand all of which were held by Momentive\u2019s current executive officers (at maximum target performance for any\nperformance-based Momentive restricted stock award).\nAt the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Momentive restricted stock will be cancelled\nand converted into the contingent right to receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of\nshares of Momentive common stock subject to such outstanding Momentive restricted stock award,\nmultiplied by (2) the per share price, less withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger\nagreement, each such converted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting\nterms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Momentive restricted stock award immediately prior to\nthe effective time of the merger, with payment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.\nOn March 13, 2022, we granted Alexander J. Lurie, our chief executive officer, a performance-based\nrestricted stock award (which we refer to as the \u201cLurie restricted stock award\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of\nthe Restricted Stock Award Agreement governing the Lurie restricted stock award (which we refer to as the\n\u201cRestricted Stock Agreement\u201d), the performance period applicable to the Lurie restricted stock award will\nend five business days prior to closing and the compensation committee will determine the number of\nshares eligible to vest (which we refer to as the \u201cLurie eligible shares\u201d) based on Momentive\u2019s total\nstockholder return and the total stockholder return of an index as described in the Restricted Stock\nAgreement. The per share price will be used to calculate Momentive\u2019s total stockholder return. The number\nof Lurie eligible shares will be calculated based on actual performance in accordance with the terms of the\nRestricted Stock Agreement and, per the Restricted Stock Agreement, will be reduced by 19,189 shares\n(the number of Lurie eligible shares that vested at the end of the one-year performance period as described\nin the Restricted Stock Agreement). Upon closing, a pro-rated number of the Lurie eligible shares will vest\nwith such pro-ration calculated by multiplying the number of Lurie eligible shares by a fraction with a\nnumerator equal to the number of completed calendar months that have elapsed between the March 13,\n2022 grant date of the Lurie restricted stock award and the closing, and a denominator of 36. Following\nclosing, the remaining Lurie eligible shares will vest in approximately equal installments on each quarterly\nanniversary of the closing through March 13, 2025, with any remaining unvested Lurie eligible shares vesting\non March 13, 2025. Vesting of the Lurie eligible shares is subject to continued service, but the Lurie eligible\nshares will be eligible for accelerated vesting upon a qualifying termination of employment under Mr. Lurie\u2019s\nchange in control and severance agreement. At 100% of target, 180,704 shares of Momentive common\nstock would become Lurie eligible shares. At maximum performance, 200% of target, or 361,408 shares of\nMomentive common stock would become Lurie eligible shares. For purposes of this disclosure, we have\nassumed that performance will be achieved at 100% of target and 161,515 shares of Momentive common\nstock (the 180,704 shares achieved at 100% of target reduced by the 19,189 shares that vested at the end\nof the one-year performance period as described in the Restricted Stock Agreement) will become Lurie\neligible shares. At maximum performance, 342,219 shares of Momentive common stock (361,408 shares\nreduced by the 19,189 shares\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat vested at the end of the one-year performance period as described in the Restricted Stock Agreement)\nwould become Lurie eligible shares.

Momentive options to purchase an aggregate of 896,431\nshares of Momentive common stock were held by Momentive\u2019s current non-employee directors, none of\nwhich have an exercise price below the per share price, and Momentive options to purchase an aggregate of\n6,672,237 shares of Momentive common stock were held by Momentive\u2019s current executive officers, of\nwhich 600,000 have an exercise price below the per share price.\nAt the effective time of the merger, each vested Momentive option will be cancelled and converted into the\nright to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive\ncommon stock subject to the vested Momentive option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share\nprice over the exercise price per share of Momentive common stock under such vested Momentive option,\nless applicable withholding taxes.\nAt the effective time of the merger, each unvested Momentive option will be cancelled and converted into the\ncontingent right to receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive\ncommon stock subject to such unvested Momentive option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per\nshare price over the exercise price per share of Momentive common stock under such unvested Momentive\noption, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such\nconverted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions as\napplied to the corresponding unvested Momentive option immediately prior to the effective time of the\nmerger, with payment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.\nAny underwater Momentive option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no consideration or\npayment.\nFor more information regarding the treatment of Momentive options held by Momentive\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cInterests of Momentive\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger-Change in Control and Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships.\u201d\nTreatment of the ESPP in connection with the Merger\nWe have taken, or will take prior to the effective time of the merger, all action that we determine to be\nreasonably necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the merger, (1) cause any offering period or\npurchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be outstanding at the effective time of the merger to\nbe terminated no later than the closing, but prior to the effective time of the merger\u037e (2) make any\nadjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period,\nbut otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed\noffering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP\u037e (3) cause the exercise (as of no\nlater than the closing, but prior to the effective time of the merger) of each outstanding purchase right\npursuant to the ESPP\u037e and (4) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence\npursuant to the ESPP upon or after the effective time of the merger.

On the third anniversary of the\neffective date of the agreement, the agreement will renew automatically for additional one-year terms unless\neither party provides the other party with written notice of nonrenewal at least one-year prior to the date of\nautomatic renewal. However, if a change in control (as defined in the applicable agreement) occurs when\nthere are fewer than 12 months remaining during the initial term or during an additional term, the term of the\nchange in control and severance agreement will extend automatically through the date that is 12 months\nfollowing the date of the change in control.

The following summary does not constitute\nany legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Momentive\u2019s stockholders exercise\ntheir appraisal rights under Section 262. STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FULL\nTEXT OF SECTION 262 AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION DISCUSSED BELOW. \n83TABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of Momentive common stock or\nbeneficial owners who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares of Momentive\ncommon stock to Momentive prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) do not vote, in\nperson or by proxy, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (3) continuously hold of record or\nbeneficially own such shares on the date of making the demand for appraisal through the effective time of\nthe merger\u037e and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth\nin Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of Momentive common stock appraised by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery and to receive payment in cash, in lieu of the consideration set forth in the merger\nagreement, for the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Momentive common stock, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of\nChancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective time of the merger through the date\nof payment of the judgment (or in certain circumstances described herein, on the difference between the\namount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation in the merger to\neach person entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding) as described\nfurther below. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a\nhearing to determine persons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders\nof shares of a class or series of stock that, immediately prior to the closing of the merger, were listed on a\nnational securities exchange who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (A) the total number of\nshares of the class or series of stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued or perfected exceeds one\npercent of the outstanding shares of such class or series as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of\nSection 262\u037e or (B) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We\nrefer to these conditions as the \u201cownership thresholds.\u201d Given that the shares of Momentive common\nstock are listed on the Nasdaq (and assuming such shares remain so listed up until closing of the merger),\nthen the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all holders of Momentive\ncommon stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is\nsatisfied.\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest on the amount determined to be the fair value of the shares subject to appraisal will accrue and\ncompound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at five\npercent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time\nduring such period (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving\ncorporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person entitled to appraisal, interest will accrue\nthereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of\nthe shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless\npaid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment\nprior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders,\nthe corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as\nof the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a\ncopy of Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at\nwhich Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes\nMomentive\u2019s notice to Momentive\u2019s stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the\nm e r g e r ,  a n d  t h e  f u l l  t e x t  o f  S e c t i o n  2 6 2  i s  a v a i l a b l e  a t  t h e  f o l l o w i n g  U R L :\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the merger, any holder of\nshares of Momentive common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve\nsuch holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the\nrequirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under\nthe DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price\ndescribed in the merger agreement less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the\nprocedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Momentive common stock, Momentive\nbelieves that if a person is considering exercising such rights, such person should seek the advice of legal\ncounsel.\nStockholders or beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of\nMomentive common stock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nsuch person must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n84\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nsuch person must deliver to Momentive a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the\nmerger agreement at the special meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch person must continuously hold of record or beneficially own the shares of Momentive\ncommon stock from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a\nperson will lose appraisal rights if the person transfers the shares before the effective time of the\nmerger)\u037e and\n\u2022\nsuch person or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndemanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after\nthe effective time of the merger (the surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition\nand has no intention of doing so).\nIn addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to\ndetermine persons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who\nasserted appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Momentive common stock unless one of the\nownership thresholds is met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the\nadoption of the merger agreement, each person who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain.\nFiling Written Demand\nA person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Momentive, before the vote on the adoption of\nthe merger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person\u2019s shares. In\naddition, that person must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A\nvote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether\nby mail or via the internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the\nshares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A person exercising\nappraisal rights must hold or own, as applicable, beneficially or of record, the shares on the date the written\ndemand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold or own, as applicable, the shares through the\neffective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless\nrevoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the\nstockholder\u2019s and beneficial owner\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written\ndemand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or\nabstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the\nmerger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of\nSection 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on\nthe adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not\nconstitute a demand. A person\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the\nadoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nIn the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a stockholder of record, the demand must reasonably\ninform Momentive of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an\nappraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a beneficial\nowner, the demand must reasonably identify the record holder of the shares for which the demand is made,\nbe accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of such stock\nand a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and\nprovide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the surviving\ncorporation and to be set forth on the verified list (as defined below).\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nMomentive Global Inc.\nOne Curiosity Way\nSan Mateo, California 94403\nAttention: Chief Legal Officer & Secretary\n85\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement, less any applicable\nwithholding taxes, by delivering to Momentive, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the\ndemand for appraisal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of\nChancery will be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and\nsuch approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just,\nincluding, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction (which we refer to as a \u201creservation\u201d) for any\napplication (as defined below)\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any person who has\nnot commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nperson\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time\nof the merger. If the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding\nwith respect to a person, such person will be entitled to receive only the fair value determined in any such\nappraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered\npursuant to the merger agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will\nnotify each stockholder (including any beneficial owner) of each constituent corporation who has properly\nmade a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption\nof the merger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective time thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any\nperson who has complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262\nmay commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy\nserved on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by any person other than the surviving\ncorporation, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders\nentitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a\npetition, and stockholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any\nnegotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Momentive common stock. Accordingly, any\npersons who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their\nappraisal rights in respect of their shares of Momentive common stock within the time and in the manner\nprescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could\nnullify a previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements\nfor an appraisal of such person\u2019s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to\nreceive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in\nfavor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which Momentive has received demands\nfor appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares\n(provided that where a beneficial owner makes a demand for appraisal directly, the record holder of such\nshares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of this aggregate\nnumber). Such statement must be given within ten days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the\nwritten request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of\ndemands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy\nthereof must be made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after such\nservice to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the \u201cverified\nlist\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and\nwith whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of\nChancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given to the\nsurviving corporation and all of the persons shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. The\ncosts of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.\n86\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAfter notice is provided to the applicable persons as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, at the\nhearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the persons who have complied with\nSection 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay require the persons who demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by stock\ncertificates to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the\npendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any person fails to comply with this requirement, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. Upon application by the surviving\ncorporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the\npersons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the verified list may participate fully in\nall proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section\n262.\nGiven that the shares common stock are listed on the Nasdaq (and assuming such shares remain so listed\nup until closing of the merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to\nall holders of shares of Momentive common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one\nof the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the persons entitled to appraisal and, with respect to\nMomentive common stock, that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect\nof persons seeking appraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the\nrules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.\nThrough such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of\nMomentive common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair\nvalue. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest from the effective time of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be\ncompounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time of the merger and\nthe date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the\nDelaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to\neach person seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to\nsubsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of\nthe shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest accrued before such voluntary\ncash payment, unless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods\nwhich are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving\nthe value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value,\nthe court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the\nenterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on\nfuture prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does\nnot encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value\narising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also\nstated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible\nof proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they\nwould receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an\ninvestment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a\n87\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmerger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262.\nALTHOUGH MOMENTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE PER SHARE PRICE IS FAIR, NO REPRESENTATION IS\nMADE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THE APPRAISAL OF FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY THE\nDELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY, AND STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT SUCH AN\nAPPRAISAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERMINATION OF A VALUE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN, OR THE\nSAME AS, THE PER SHARE PRICE. Neither Momentive nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per\nshare price to any persons exercising appraisal rights, and each of Momentive and Parent reserves the\nrights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any\nappraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Momentive common\nstock is less than the per share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or, with respect to\nMomentive common stock, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of\npersons seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest,\nif any, by the surviving corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such\nperson upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court\nof Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such Delaware Court of Chancery may be\nenforced.\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of\nexperts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name\nappears on the verified list who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith\n(which we refer to as an \u201capplication\u201d), the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion\nof such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal that were not\ndismissed pursuant to the terms of Section 262 or subject to an award pursuant to a reservation. In the\nabsence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Momentive common stock under Section\n262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of\nMomentive common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the\nright to receive the per share price as provided in the merger agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or\neffectively lose, such person\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the\neffective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of\nthose seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Momentive common stock, or if the person\ndelivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and an\nacceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the effective time of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance\nwith Section 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of Momentive common stock for any purpose or to\nreceive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions\npayable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective time of the merger)\u037e provided,\nhowever, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the\nownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to\nthe shares of Momentive common stock, or if such person delivers to the surviving corporation a written\nwithdrawal of such person\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, within 60 days after\nthe effective time of the merger, then the right of such person to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person\nwithout the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court\ndeems just, including, without limitation, a reservation\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect\nthe right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a\nnamed party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the\nmerger within 60 days after the effective time of the merger.\n88\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of\nappraisal rights.

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that\nmay be relevant to U.S. holders and Non-U.S. holders of shares of Momentive common stock whose shares\nare converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d), U.S. Treasury Regulations\npromulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\n(which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy\nstatement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.\nThis discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of Momentive common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, as property held for investment purposes). With\nrespect to holders whose shares of Momentive common stock were subject to vesting restrictions at the\ntime such shares were acquired, if any, this discussion assumes that a valid and timely election pursuant to\nSection 83(b) of the Code was made with respect to such shares.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences\nthat may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does\nnot address:\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who received their shares of Momentive common stock in a\ncompensatory transaction or pursuant to the exercise of Momentive options, or Momentive RSUs,\nor otherwise in connection with the performance of services\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under\nU.S. federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions\u037e tax-exempt organizations\u037e S\ncorporations, partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-\nthrough entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e insurance companies\u037e mutual funds\u037e dealers in\nstocks and securities\u037e traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of\naccounting for their securities\u037e regulated investment companies\u037e real estate investment trusts\u037e\nentities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules\u037e holders who hold their common stock as \u201cqualified\nsmall business stock\u201d for purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code, as \u201cSection 1244\nstock\u201d within the meaning of Section 1244 of the Code, or through individual retirement or other tax-\ndeferred accounts\u037e Non-U.S. holders that own (directly or by attribution) more than five percent of\nMomentive common stock\u037e or U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term residents of\nthe United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders holding shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion,\nstraddle, or other risk reduction transaction\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to U.S. holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or\nother entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of\ngross income with respect to the shares of Momentive common stock being taken into account in\nan \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d (as defined in the Code)\u037e\n\u2022\nany U.S. federal estate, gift, or alternative or other minimum tax consequences\u037e\n89TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nany state, local, or non-U.S. tax consequences\u037e or\n\u2022\ntax consequences to persons that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand\nappraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Momentive common stock, then the tax\ntreatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Momentive common stock and\npartners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.\nNo ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe merger described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given\nthat a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court. Further, no opinion of counsel has\nbeen or will be rendered with respect to the tax consequences of the merger or related transactions.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE\nLEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-\nINCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.\nU.S. Holders\nGeneral\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Momentive common\nstock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\ncreated or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of\nColumbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e\nor\n\u2022\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the\ncontrol of one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2)\nhas a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United\nStates person.\nTaxable Sale of Company Capital Stock\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Momentive common stock pursuant to the\nmerger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. holder\u2019s\ngain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S.\nholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in the shares surrendered in the merger generally will equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for\nthose shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such\nU.S. holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the\nmerger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate\nU.S. holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder\nacquired different blocks of shares of Momentive common stock at different times and/or different prices,\nsuch holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block\nof Momentive common stock.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nGeneral\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Momentive common\nstock that is neither a U.S. holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n90\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTaxable Sale of Company Capital Stock\nSubject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below) withholding, any gain\nrealized by a Non-U.S. holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax\nunless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. holder in the United\nStates (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment maintained by such Non-U.S. holder in the United States), in which case such gain\ngenerally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons,\nand, if the Non-U.S. holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits\ntax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in\nthe taxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in\nwhich case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower\nrate under an applicable income tax treaty) and such person will generally be required to file a U.S.\nfederal income tax return\u037e or\n\u2022\nMomentive is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is\ndefined in Section 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the\nshorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period with\nrespect to the applicable shares of Momentive common stock (which we refer to as the \u201crelevant\nperiod\u201d) and, if shares of Momentive common stock are regularly traded on an established\nsecurities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. holder\nowns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of Momentive common stock at\nany time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above),\nexcept that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair\nmarket value of its U.S. real property interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50\npercent of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other\nassets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real property interests\ngenerally include land, improvements and associated personal property. Although there can be no\nassurances in this regard, we believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time\nduring the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their\ntax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds\nreceived by a holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. holder\nthat furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. holder is not subject to\nbackup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or an appropriate substitute or successor form)\u037e or (2) a Non-U.S.\nholder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-U.S. holder\u2019s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of\nIRS Form W-8 (or an appropriate substitute or successor form)\u037e or (b) otherwise appropriately establishes an\nexemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld\nunder the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nA U.S. holder may be required to retain records related to such holder\u2019s common stock and file with its U.S.\nfederal income tax return, for the taxable year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain\nfacts relating to the merger.\nAdditional Withholding Requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance\nissued thereunder (which we refer to as, collectively, \u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30\npercent on certain payments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under these rules)\nunless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain\n91\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npayments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain\nU.S. account holders of such institution (which include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as\nwell as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA\nalso generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-\nfinancial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a certification identifying certain\ndirect and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain\ncircumstances, a Non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form,\nwould eliminate the FATCA withholding applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of\nMomentive common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department\nstated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nHolders of Momentive common stock are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the\npossible implications of FATCA on the disposition of Momentive common stock pursuant to the merger.\nTHE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE INCLUDED\nFOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW.\nBECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES MAY DIFFER, EACH U.S. HOLDER AND NON-U.S. HOLDER\nSHOULD CONSULT SUCH HOLDER\u2019S TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE\nRULES DISCUSSED ABOVE TO SUCH HOLDER AND THE PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS OF THE\nMERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE,\nLOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.",

We encourage you to carefully read\nand consider the merger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety\nbecause this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to\nyou. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger\nagreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements described below and included in the merger\nagreement (1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were\nmade solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important\nqualifications, limitations, and supplemental information agreed to by Momentive, Parent, and Merger Sub in\nconnection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a\ncontractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed\nwith the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub\nby Momentive in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may\nhave been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between\nMomentive and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts. Further, the\nrepresentations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances\nin which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or\notherwise. Momentive\u2019s stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement\nand should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements or any descriptions\nthereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Momentive, Parent, or Merger Sub or\nany of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. Except where expressly\nprovided in the merger agreement, none of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the\nmerger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of\nthe merger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations\non the respective businesses of Momentive, Parent, and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain\nactions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as\notherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the\npublic. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with\ninformation regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information\nregarding Momentive, Parent, Merger Sub, or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations,\nwarranties, covenants, and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you\nshould read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in Momentive\u2019s filings with the SEC\nregarding Momentive and Momentive\u2019s business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub, and Momentive\nthat is no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the\nmerger agreement) of the last condition to the closing of the merger (other than those conditions that by\ntheir term are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the\nextent permitted under the merger agreement) of such conditions)\u037e or (2) at such other time agreed to by\nMomentive, Parent, and Merger Sub in writing. On the closing date of the merger, the parties will cause the\nmerger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of\nthat certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at a later time agreed to in\nwriting by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL.",

At or prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will deposit (or cause to be\ndeposited) with the payment agent an amount of cash that is sufficient in the aggregate to pay the\naggregate merger consideration payable to Momentive\u2019s stockholders in accordance with the merger\nagreement.\nPromptly (and in any event within one business day) following the effective time of the merger, Parent and\nthe surviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately\nprior to the effective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the\nmerger represented outstanding shares of Momentive common stock (other than excluded shares), a letter\nof transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender their stock certificates in exchange for\ntheir respective portion of the merger consideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates for\ncancellation (or an appropriate affidavit of loss, together with any required bond)\u037e and (2) a duly completed\n102TABLE OF CONTENTS\nand validly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive an amount in\ncash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Momentive common stock represented\nby such certificate and (y) the per share price. The amount of any per share price paid to Momentive\u2019s\nstockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of Momentive common stock held in book-entry form\n(which we refer to as \u201cuncertificated shares\u201d) will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed\nletter of transmittal (as both are described above) to the payment agent to receive the consideration payable\nin respect thereof. Each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of\nuncertificated shares that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented an outstanding\nshare of Momentive common stock (other than excluded shares) will, upon receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d\nin customary form at the effective time of the merger, be entitled to receive, and the payment agent will pay\nand deliver as promptly as practicable, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number\nof shares of Momentive common stock represented by such holder\u2019s transferred uncertificated shares\u037e and\n(2) the per share price. The amount of consideration paid to such Momentive stockholders will not include\ninterest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.\nIf any certificates or uncertificated shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which\nany cash in respect of such certificate or uncertificated share would otherwise escheat to or become the\nproperty of any governmental authority, then any such cash in respect of such certificate or uncertificated\nshare will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all\nclaims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. None of the payment agent, Parent, the surviving\ncorporation, or any other party will be liable to any of Momentive\u2019s stockholders with respect to any cash\namounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law, or\nsimilar laws.\nThe letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such\ncertificate has been stolen or destroyed. In the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen, or\ndestroyed, then the payment agent will issue the per share price payable in respect of thereof to such holder\nupon the making by such holder of an affidavit for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. Parent or the\npayment agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the per share price,\nrequire such stockholder to deliver a bond in such amount as Parent or the payment agent may direct as\nindemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the surviving corporation, or the payment\nagent with respect to such certificate.",

Pursuant to the Merger, each share of\ncommon stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of the Company that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior\nto the effective time of the Merger (such shares, collectively, \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d or \u201cShares\u201d and each, a\n\u201cShare\u201d), other than (i) each Share to be cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(ii) of the Merger\nAgreement and (ii) Dissenting Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), shall be\nconverted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $9.46 in cash, without interest (the\n\u201cMerger Consideration\u201d), subject to any required Tax (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) withholding\nas provided in the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger\nAgreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in\naccordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other\nthan Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated March\n13, 2023 (the \u201cDraft Merger Agreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial\nstatements and other business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-\nlooking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial\nprojections and operating data of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d). Additionally, we discussed the past\nand current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the\nCompany. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and\ncompared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock\nwith that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the\nfinancial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other\nanalyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.\nOne Maritime Plaza | 24th Floor | San Francisco, CA 94111\nTel: 415.844.7700 | www.qatalyst.com | Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u202f \nIn arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed\nwith, us by the Company.

In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the\nreceipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be\nimposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in\nthe proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities\n(contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or\nappraisal. In addition, we have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of\nthe Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with\nsuch technology and products.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our\nservices, a portion of which will become payable upon delivery of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger\nfee if the Merger is consummated.

Qatalyst Partners\nand/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or\nParent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,\ndomestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these\nactivities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise\neffect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.\nOne Maritime Plaza | 24th Floor | San Francisco, CA 94111\nTel: 415.844.7700 | www.qatalyst.com | Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u202f\nThis opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice.

As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after giving\neffect to any \u201cflex\u201d provisions in the Debt Commitment Letters or the Fee Letters) that (A) it will be\nunable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing to be satisfied by it, whether\nor not such term or condition is contained in the Financing Letters or the Fee Letters\u037e or (B) the full\namounts committed pursuant to the Financing Letters will not be available as of the Closing if the terms\nor conditions contained in the Financing Letters to be satisfied by it are satisfied. As of the date of this\nAgreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, all commitment or other\nfees, expenses, premiums and charges that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this\nAgreement pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters.
