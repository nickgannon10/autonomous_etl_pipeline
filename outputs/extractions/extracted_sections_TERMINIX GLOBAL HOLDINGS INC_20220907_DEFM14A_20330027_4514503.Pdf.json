            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nThe following are brief answers to certain questions that you, as a stockholder of Terminix, may have\nregarding the transaction and the other matters being considered at the Terminix special meeting. You are\nurged to carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents referred to in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus in their entirety because this section may not provide all the information that is\nimportant to you regarding these matters. Please refer to the section of this proxy statement/prospectus\nentitled \u201cSummary\u201d beginning on page 20 for a summary of important information regarding the merger\nagreement, the transaction and the related transactions. Additional important information is contained in\nthe annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement/prospectus. You\nmay obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, without charge,\nby following the instructions under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cWhere You Can\nFind Additional Information\u201d beginning on page 328.\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?\nYou are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because Terminix has agreed to be acquired by\nRentokil Initial through (1) a merger of Merger Sub I with and into Terminix (which we refer to as the\n\u201cfirst merger\u201d) with Terminix surviving the first merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco, and (2)\nimmediately following the first merger, a merger of Terminix with and into Merger Sub II (which we refer\nto as the \u201csecond merger\u201d and together with the first merger, the \u201ctransaction\u201d) with Merger Sub II\nsurviving the second merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco and an indirect wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Rentokil Initial. The merger agreement, which governs the terms and conditions of the\ntransaction, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.\nYour vote is required in connection with the transaction. Terminix is sending these materials to its\nstockholders to help them decide how to vote their shares with respect to the adoption of the merger\nagreement, among other important matters.\nWhat matters am I being asked to vote on?\nIn order to complete the transaction, among other things, Terminix stockholders must adopt the merger\nagreement in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which proposal is\nreferred to as the \u201cmerger proposal.\u201d\nTerminix is holding the Terminix special meeting to obtain approval of the merger proposal. At the\nTerminix special meeting, Terminix stockholders will also be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to\napprove on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to\nTerminix\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement (which proposal we refer to as the \u201ccompensation proposal\u201d).\nYour vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The approval of the\nmerger proposal is a condition to the obligations of Terminix to complete the transaction. The approval\nof the compensation proposal is not a condition to the obligations of Terminix to complete the\ntransaction.\nWhen and where will the Terminix special meeting take place?\nThe Terminix special meeting will be held virtually via the Internet on October 6, 2022, beginning at 8:30\na.m., Eastern Time. The Terminix special meeting will be held solely via live webcast and there will not be\na physical meeting location. Terminix stockholders will be able to attend the Terminix special meeting\nonline and vote their shares electronically during the meeting by visiting\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TMX2022SM (which we refer to as the \u201cspecial meeting website\u201d).\nIf you choose to attend the Terminix special meeting and vote your shares during the Terminix special\nmeeting, you will need the 16-digit control number located on your proxy card as described in the\nsection of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Terminix Special Meeting - Attending the\nTerminix Special Meeting\u201d beginning on page 70.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d you may only vote them via the special meeting website if you\nobtain a specific control number from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote\nthe shares. Even if you plan to attend the Terminix special meeting, Terminix recommends that\n6 Q: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nyou vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later\ndecide not to or become unable to attend the Terminix special meeting.\nDoes my vote matter?\nYes, your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The merger cannot\nbe completed unless, among other things, the merger proposal is approved by holders of at least a\nmajority of the outstanding shares of Terminix common stock entitled to vote. As of August 15, 2022,\nthe latest practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, Terminix directors and\nexecutive officers, and their affiliates, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote less than 1% of the\ntotal outstanding shares of Terminix common stock. Although no Terminix director or executive officer\nhas entered into any agreement obligating them to do so, Terminix currently expects that all of its\ndirectors and executive officers will vote their shares \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the\ncompensation proposal.\nA failure to return or submit your proxy or to vote at the Terminix special meeting as provided in this\nproxy statement/prospectus will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. The\nfailure to return or submit your proxy and to attend the Terminix special meeting will have no effect on\nthe compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present), but the failure of any shares present or\nrepresented at the Terminix special meeting to vote on the proposal will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the compensation proposal. The Terminix board of directors unanimously recommends that\nyou vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal.\nWhat will Terminix stockholders receive for their shares if the transaction is completed?\nIf the transaction is completed, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Terminix\noutstanding (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive, at the\nelection of the holders of such shares and subject to certain allocation and proration provisions of the\nmerger agreement, as described in the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 132 and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fAllocation of\nMerger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page 135, either (1) a\nnumber of American depositary shares of Rentokil Initial (\u201cRentokil Initial ADSs\u201d) (each representing a\nbeneficial interest in five ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial (\u201cRentokil Initial ordinary shares\u201d)) equal to\n(A) 1.0619 (the \u201cexchange ratio\u201d) plus (B) the quotient of $11.00 (the \u201cper share cash amount\u201d) and the\nvolume weighted average price (measured in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil Initial ADSs (measured using the\nvolume weighted average price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares multiplied by the number of Rentokil\nInitial ordinary shares represented by each Rentokil Initial ADS) for the trading day that is two trading\ndays prior to the closing date of the transaction (or such other date as may be mutually agreed to by\nRentokil Initial and Terminix) (such trading day, the \u201cmeasurement day,\u201d such price, the \u201cRentokil Initial\nADS price,\u201d and such number of Rentokil Initial ADSs, the \u201cstock consideration\u201d) or (2) an amount in\ncash, without interest, and in U.S. dollars equal to (A) the per share cash amount plus (B) the product of\nthe exchange ratio and the Rentokil Initial ADS price (the \u201ccash consideration\u201d ). We refer to the stock\nconsideration and the cash consideration payable per share of Terminix common stock in the\ntransaction, as applicable, as the \u201cmerger consideration.\u201d Any Terminix stockholder who does not make\nan election will be deemed to have made an election to receive stock consideration. Each Terminix\nstockholder will receive cash in U.S. dollars (without interest) in lieu of any fractional Rentokil Initial\nADSs that such stockholder would otherwise receive in the transaction. Any cash amounts to be\nreceived by a Terminix stockholder in lieu of any fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs will be rounded down\nto the nearest cent.\nThe total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued and the aggregate amount of cash to be paid\nunder the terms of the merger agreement will not vary as a result of individual election preferences. The\nRentokil Initial ADSs issued in connection with the transaction will be listed on the New York Stock\nExchange (which we refer to as the \u201cNYSE\u201d) and are expected to trade under the symbol \u201cRTO.\u201d Based\non the number of shares of Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares outstanding on\nAugust 31, 2022, immediately after completion of the transaction, we expect that former Terminix\nstockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the transaction would own Rentokil Initial ADSs\nrepresenting approximately 25.7% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial, and Rentokil\n7 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInitial shareholders immediately prior to the transaction would own approximately 74.3% of the\noutstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial. Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are traded on the London\nStock Exchange plc\u2019s main market for listed securities (which we refer to as the \u201cLSE\u201d) under the symbol\n\u201cRTO.\u201d Terminix common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cTMX.\u201d We encourage you to\nobtain current quotes for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the common stock of Terminix.\nThe value of the per share cash consideration and the value of the per share stock consideration as of\nthe measurement day will be substantially the same. For example, as of July 15, 2022 (which date has\nbeen selected solely for illustrative purposes), Rentokil Initial\u2019s volume weighted share price was\n\u00a35.0825 (expressed in whole pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-\nU.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.1855. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS\nprice would be $30.13 and, accordingly:\nthe per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $42.99 which is (A) $11.00,\nthe per share cash amount, plus (B) $31.99, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.13,\nthe Rentokil Initial ADS price as of such date\u037e and\nthe per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4270\n(which have an approximate value as of such date of $42.99) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange\nratio, plus (B) 0.3651, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.13, the Rentokil\nInitial ADS price as of such date.\nAs a result, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the per\nshare stock consideration was approximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common stock. The\nconsideration to be paid to Terminix stockholders is subject, pursuant to the terms of the merger\nagreement, to automatic adjustment and proration in the manner described in the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 132\nto ensure that the total amount of cash paid and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs issued in the\ntransaction equal the aggregate amount agreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed illustrations of\nthe potential allocation and proration of the merger consideration, see the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fAllocation of Merger Consideration and\nIllustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page 135.\nThe market value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders will fluctuate with the market\nprice of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and will not be known at the time that Terminix stockholders\nvote on the transaction. Based on Rentokil Initial\u2019s five-day average daily volume weighted share price\nand the five-day average of the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in each case, over the period\nspanning December 6, 2021 to December 10, 2021, inclusive, the implied value of the merger\nconsideration to Terminix stockholders was approximately $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock.\nAs described in the prior paragraph, based on Rentokil Initial\u2019s volume weighted average share price\nand the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in each case, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of the\nmerger consideration to Terminix stockholders was approximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common\nstock. To further demonstrate how the implied value of the merger consideration may fluctuate over\ntime, we note that as of August 31, 2022 (the latest practicable date prior to the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus), Rentokil Initial\u2019s volume weighted share price was \u00a35.2331 (expressed in whole\npounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate was\n1.1638. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS price would be $30.45 and,\naccordingly:\nthe per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $43.33 which is (A) $11.00,\nthe per share cash amount, plus (B) $32.33, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.45,\nthe Rentokil Initial ADS price as of such date\u037e and\nthe per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4231\n(which have an approximate value on such date of $43.33) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange\nratio, plus (B) 0.3612, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.45, the Rentokil\nInitial ADS price as of such date.\n8 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs a result, as of August 31, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the\nper share stock consideration was approximately $43.33 per share of Terminix common stock. The\nconsideration to be paid to Terminix stockholders is subject, pursuant to the terms of the merger\nagreement, to automatic adjustment and proration in the manner described in the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 132\nto ensure that the total amount of cash paid and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs issued in the\ntransaction equal the aggregate amount agreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed illustrations of\nthe potential allocation and proration of the merger consideration, see the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fAllocation of Merger Consideration and\nIllustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page 135.\nThe market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the implied value of the merger consideration\ncould be greater than, less than or the same as their market price or implied value, as applicable, on the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the Terminix special meeting. Accordingly, you\nshould obtain current market quotations for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock\nbefore deciding how to vote with respect to the merger proposal. Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and\nTerminix common stock are traded on the LSE and the NYSE, under the symbols \u201cRTO\u201d and \u201cTMX,\u201d\nrespectively. For more information regarding the merger consideration to be received by Terminix\nstockholders (including the applicable allocation and proration provisions and detailed illustrations\nthereof) if the transaction is completed, see the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 132 and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202f\nAllocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page\n135.\nWhat is an American depositary share?\nAn American depositary share, or ADS, represents a specified number of securities of a non-U.S.\ncompany deposited with a custodian bank. Each Rentokil Initial ADS will represent five Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares. Rentokil Initial ADSs constituting any of the merger consideration will be issued in\nuncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical American depository receipt evidencing such Rentokil\nInitial ADSs is required under applicable law. The Rentokil Initial ADSs will be issued pursuant to the\nterms of the deposit agreement.\nIf I am a Terminix stockholder, how do I make an election for the type of merger consideration that I prefer to\nreceive?\nEach holder of record of Terminix common stock as of September 6, 2022 will be mailed a form of election\nat least 20 business days in advance of the first effective time. Each Terminix stockholder should specify\nin the form of election (1) the number of shares of Terminix common stock that such stockholder elects\nto have exchanged for the cash consideration and (2) the number of shares of Terminix common stock\nthat such stockholder elects to have exchanged for the stock consideration. Any Terminix stockholder\nwho does not make an election will be deemed to have made an election to receive the stock\nconsideration. Any Terminix stockholder who votes against the merger proposal is still entitled to make\na cash/stock election with respect to such stockholder\u2019s shares of Terminix common stock.\nThe consideration to be paid to Terminix stockholders is subject, pursuant to the terms of the merger\nagreement, to automatic adjustment and proration in the manner described in the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 132\nto ensure that the total amount of cash paid and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued\nin the transaction equals the aggregate amount agreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed\nillustrations of the potential allocation and proration of the merger consideration, see the section of this\nproxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fAllocation of Merger Consideration and\nIllustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page 135. No fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs will\nbe issued in the transaction, and Terminix stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional\nRentokil Initial ADSs. An election will have been properly made only if the designated exchange agent\nhas received a properly completed form of election at its designated office by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on\nthe date that is three business days preceding the closing date. Terminix and Rentokil\n9 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInitial expect to complete the transaction on October 12, 2022, assuming the merger proposal is\napproved by Terminix stockholders on October 6, 2022 and the other conditions to closing (described\nunder the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fConditions to\nCompletion of the Transaction\u201d beginning on page 141) are satisfied (including approval of the\nRentokil Initial transaction-related proposals by Rentokil Initial shareholders on October 6, 2022). In\nconnection with the anticipated completion of the transaction, the anticipated election deadline for\nTerminix stockholders to elect the form of merger consideration they desire to receive in the transaction\nhas been set for 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 6, 2022.\nWill I receive the form of merger consideration that I request on the form of election?\nNot necessarily. The aggregate amount of cash and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be paid\nand issued, respectively, to Terminix stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement will not vary as a\nresult of individual election preferences. If there is an oversubscription of the aggregate amount of cash\navailable to be paid by Rentokil Initial to Terminix stockholders due to the elections of Terminix\nstockholders, the aggregate amount of cash payable by Rentokil Initial in the transaction will not be\nincreased. Similarly, if there is an oversubscription of the aggregate number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to\nbe issued by Rentokil Initial to Terminix stockholders due to the elections of Terminix stockholders (or\nfailures to make an election), the aggregate number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued by Rentokil\nInitial in the transaction will not be increased. Rather, in either such case, the exchange agent will\nallocate between cash and Rentokil Initial ADSs in accordance with the proration mechanics described\nin \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d to ensure that the total amount of cash paid and\nthe total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued in the transaction equals the aggregate amount\nagreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed illustrations of the potential allocation and proration of\nthe merger consideration, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fAllocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d\nbeginning on page 135.\nAccordingly, there is no assurance that each Terminix stockholder that has made a valid election to\nreceive cash consideration or stock consideration will receive the form of consideration elected with\nrespect to the shares of Terminix common stock held by such stockholder.\nFor additional information, see the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\nProposal\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 74 and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fAllocation of\nMerger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page 135.\nWill the value of the merger consideration I receive vary depending on whether I make the stock election or cash\nelection?\nThe value of the per share cash consideration and the value of the per share stock consideration as of\nthe measurement day will be substantially the same. If the price of Rentokil Initial ADSs upon the close\nof the transaction equals the Rentokil Initial ADS price (measured using the volume weighted average\nprice of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares as of the measurement day multiplied by five), the value at\ntransaction close of the merger consideration you receive will be the same, regardless of whether you\nmake the stock election or cash election. Because the price of Rentokil Initial ADSs upon the close of\nthe transaction may be higher or lower than the Rentokil Initial ADS price (measured using the volume\nweighted average price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares as of the measurement day multiplied by five),\nthe value at transaction close of the merger consideration you receive may vary, depending on whether\nyou make the stock election or cash election. The Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued in connection with\nthe transaction will be listed on the NYSE.\nWhat is the deadline for making an election?\nYour election, to be properly made, must be received by the exchange agent at its designated office by\nthe election deadline, which is 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date that is three business days preceding\nthe closing date. Terminix and Rentokil Initial expect to complete the transaction on October 12, 2022,\nassuming the merger proposal is approved by Terminix stockholders on October 6, 2022 and the other\nconditions to closing (described under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u202f-\u202fConditions to Completion of the Transaction\u201d beginning on page 141) are\n10 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsatisfied (including approval of the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals by Rentokil Initial\nshareholders on October 6, 2022). In connection with the anticipated completion of the transaction, the\nanticipated election deadline for Terminix stockholders to elect the form of merger consideration they\ndesire to receive in the transaction has been set for 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 6, 2022.\nCan Terminix stockholders revoke their election for cash consideration or stock consideration (which we refer\nto as a \u201ccash/stock election\u201d) after submitting their initial cash/stock election?\nYes. Any record holder of Terminix common stock who has delivered a duly completed election form to\nthe exchange agent may, at any time prior to the election deadline, revoke such holder\u2019s cash/stock\nelection only by written notice received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline.\nWhat happens if I do not send a form of election or it is not received by the election deadline?\nIf the exchange agent does not receive a properly completed form of election from you at or prior to the\nelection deadline, then you will be deemed to have elected to receive stock consideration with respect\nto your shares of Terminix common stock. You bear the risk of delivery of the form of election to the\nexchange agent.\nCan Terminix stockholders transfer their shares after submitting an initial cash/stock election?\nTerminix stockholders of record who have made a cash/stock election will be unable to sell or otherwise\ntransfer their shares of Terminix common stock after making such election, unless the cash/stock\nelection is properly revoked before such election deadline in accordance with the election procedures or\nunless the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms.\nHow does the Terminix board of directors recommend that I vote at the Terminix special meeting?\nThe Terminix board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal.\nIn considering the recommendations of the Terminix board of directors, Terminix stockholders should be\naware that Terminix directors and executive officers may have interests in the transaction that are\ndifferent from, or in addition to, their interests as Terminix stockholders. These interests may include,\namong others, the treatment of outstanding Terminix equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement,\nthe payment of severance benefits and acceleration of outstanding Terminix equity awards upon certain\nterminations of employment, and the combined company\u2019s agreement to indemnify Terminix directors\nand executive officers against certain claims and liabilities. For a more complete description of these\ninterests, see the information provided in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Proposal\u202f-\u202fInterests of Terminix\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction\u201d\nbeginning on page 105.\nHow do Terminix\u2019s directors and executive officers intend to vote?\nTerminix currently expects that Terminix\u2019s directors and executive officers eligible to vote on the\nproposals brought before the Terminix special meeting will vote their Terminix common stock \u201cFOR\u201d the\nmerger proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal.\nWho is entitled to vote at the Terminix special meeting?\nAll holders of record of shares of Terminix common stock who held shares at the close of business on\nSeptember 6, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201crecord date\u201d), are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote\nat, the Terminix special meeting. Each such holder of Terminix common stock is entitled to cast one vote\non each matter properly brought before the Terminix special meeting for each share of Terminix common\nstock that such holder owned of record as of the record date. Attendance at the Terminix special\nmeeting is not required to vote. See below and the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled\n\u201cThe Terminix Special Meeting\u202f-\u202fMethods of Voting\u201d beginning on page 68 for instructions on how to\nvote your shares without attending the Terminix special meeting.\n11 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhat is a proxy?\nA proxy is a stockholder\u2019s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such\nstockholder on their behalf. The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Terminix\ncommon stock is referred to as a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\nHow many votes do I have for the Terminix special meeting?\nEach Terminix stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Terminix common stock held of record\nas of the close of business on the record date. As of the close of business on the record date, there\nwere 121,606,696 outstanding shares of Terminix common stock.\nWhat constitutes a quorum for the Terminix special meeting?\nA quorum means the presence in person (including virtually via the Internet) or by proxy of the holders\nof record of a majority of the Terminix common stock entitled to vote at the Terminix special meeting.\nWhat happens if the transaction is not completed?\nIf the merger proposal is not approved by Terminix stockholders, or if the transaction is not completed\nfor any other reason, Terminix stockholders will not receive the merger consideration or any other\nconsideration in connection with the transaction, and their shares of Terminix common stock will remain\noutstanding.\nIf the transaction is not completed, Terminix will remain an independent public company and the\nTerminix common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cTMX.\u201d\nIf the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Terminix may be required to pay\nRentokil Initial by way of compensation a termination payment of $200 million. If the merger agreement\nis terminated under other specified circumstances, Rentokil Initial may be required to pay Terminix by\nway of compensation a termination payment of $150 million. In addition, either party may be required to\npay to the other party by way of compensation a payment of $50 million if the merger agreement is\nterminated in certain specified circumstances. See the section of this proxy statement/\u200bprospectus\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination of the Merger Agreement\u201d beginning on page 160 for a\nmore detailed discussion of the termination payments.\nWhat stockholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal at the Terminix special meeting? What will\nhappen if I fail to vote or abstain from voting on each proposal at the Terminix special meeting?\nProposal 1: Merger Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the Terminix special meeting, approval\nof the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the\noutstanding shares of Terminix common stock entitled to vote. Accordingly, a Terminix stockholder\u2019s\nabstention from voting or the failure of any Terminix stockholder to vote (including the failure of a\nTerminix stockholder who holds their shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee\nto give voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee with respect to the merger proposal),\nwill have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nProposal 2: Compensation Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the Terminix special meeting,\napproval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority\nin voting power of the outstanding shares of Terminix common stock present in person (including\nvirtually via the Internet) or represented by proxy at the Terminix special meeting and entitled to vote.\nAccordingly, a broker non-vote or a Terminix stockholder\u2019s failure to return or submit a proxy and to\nattend the Terminix special meeting will have no effect on the compensation proposal (assuming a\nquorum is present), but the failure of any shares present or represented at the Terminix special meeting\nand entitled to vote on the proposal to vote will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\ncompensation proposal.\n12 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the merger-\nrelated compensation for Terminix\u2019s named executive officers (i.e., the compensation proposal)?\nUnder SEC rules, Terminix is required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote of its stockholders with\nrespect to the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Terminix\u2019s named executive officers\nthat is based on or otherwise relates to the transaction.\nWhat happens if Terminix stockholders do not approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the merger-related\ncompensation for Terminix\u2019s named executive officers (i.e., the compensation proposal)?\nBecause the vote to approve the compensation proposal is advisory in nature, the outcome of the vote\nwill not be binding upon Terminix or the combined company and the completion of the transaction is not\nconditioned or dependent upon the approval of the compensation proposal. Accordingly, the merger-\nrelated compensation, which is described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Proposal\u202f-\u202fInterests of Terminix\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction\u201d\nbeginning on page 105 of this proxy statement/prospectus, may be paid to Terminix\u2019s named executive\nofficers even if Terminix\u2019s stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal.\nHow can I vote my shares at the Terminix special meeting?\nShares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record of Terminix may be voted during the\nTerminix special meeting via the special meeting website. If you choose to vote your shares during the\nvirtual meeting, you will need the 16-digit control number included on your proxy card in order to access\nthe special meeting website and to vote as described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus\nentitled \u201cThe Terminix Special Meeting\u202f-\u202fAttending the Terminix Special Meeting\u201d beginning on page\n70.\nShares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d may be voted via the special meeting website only if you obtain a specific\ncontrol number and follow the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. See the\nsection of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Terminix Special Meeting\u202f-\u202fAttending the\nTerminix Special Meeting\u201d beginning on page 70.\nEven if you plan to attend the Terminix special meeting, Terminix recommends that you vote your shares\nin advance as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to or become\nunable to attend the Terminix special meeting.\nAdditional information on attending the Terminix special meeting can be found under the section of this\nproxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Terminix Special Meeting\u201d beginning on page 66.\nHow can I vote my shares without attending the Terminix special meeting?\nWhether you hold your shares directly as the stockholder of record of Terminix or beneficially in \u201cstreet\nname,\u201d you may direct your vote by proxy without attending the Terminix special meeting via the special\nmeeting website. If you are a stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the Internet, or by\ntelephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card.

As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote your shares directly at\nthe Terminix special meeting. You may also grant a proxy for your vote directly to Terminix or to a third\nparty to vote your shares at the Terminix special meeting.\nIf your shares of common stock in Terminix are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you are\nconsidered the beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d Your bank, broker or other nominee\n13 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwill send you, as the beneficial owner, a package describing the procedures for voting your shares and\nyou must instruct the bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote them by following the instructions\nthat the bank, broker or other nominee provides to you with these proxy materials. Most banks, brokers\nand other nominees offer the ability for stockholders to submit voting instructions by mail by\ncompleting a voting instruction card, by telephone, and by the Internet.\nIf my shares of Terminix common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my\nbank, broker or other nominee automatically vote those shares for me?\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of Terminix common\nstock if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures\nprovided by your bank, broker or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares. Under the NYSE\nrules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of Terminix common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d\nfor their customers have authority to vote on \u201croutine\u201d proposals when they have not received\ninstructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers and other nominees are prohibited from\nexercising their voting discretion with respect to non-routine matters, which include all the proposals\ncurrently scheduled to be considered and voted on at the Terminix special meeting. As a result, absent\nspecific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, banks, brokers and other nominees are\nnot empowered to vote such shares.\nSince there are no items on the agenda that your broker has discretionary authority to vote upon, broker\nnon-votes will not be counted as present at the Terminix special meeting for the purposes of\ndetermining a quorum if you fail to instruct your broker on how to vote on the proposals. Therefore, a\nbroker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. If you fail to\nsubmit any instruction to your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have no effect on the compensation\nproposal, assuming that a quorum is otherwise present.\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the Terminix special meeting?\nIf you hold shares of Terminix common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d and also directly in your name as a\nstockholder of record or otherwise, or if you hold shares of Terminix common stock in more than one\nbrokerage account, you may receive more than one set of voting materials relating to the Terminix\nspecial meeting.\nRecord Holders.

For each proposal to be voted\non at the Terminix special meeting, you may specify whether your shares of Terminix common stock\nshould be voted for or against, or abstain from voting.\nHow will my shares of Terminix common stock be voted if I return a blank proxy?\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy and do not indicate how you want your shares of Terminix\ncommon stock to be voted, then your shares of Terminix common stock will be voted in accordance with\nthe recommendation of the Terminix board of directors: \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the\ncompensation proposal.\nCan I change my vote after I have submitted my proxy?\nAny Terminix stockholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke the proxy and change their vote before\nthe proxy is voted at the Terminix special meeting by doing any of the following:\n14 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsubsequently submitting a new proxy (including by submitting a proxy via the Internet or telephone)\nfor the Terminix special meeting that is received by the deadline specified on the accompanying proxy\ncard\u037e\ngiving written notice of your revocation to Terminix\u2019s Corporate Secretary\u037e or\nrevoking your proxy and voting at the Terminix special meeting.\nExecution or revocation of a proxy will not in any way affect your right to attend the Terminix special\nmeeting and vote thereat.

All of the proposals currently expected to be brought before the Terminix special\nmeeting are \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters under the NYSE rules.\nA \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d occurs on an item when (1) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary\nauthority to vote on one or more proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not\npermitted to vote on other proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and\n(2) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with such instructions.\nBecause all of the proposals currently expected to be voted on at the Terminix special meeting are non-\nroutine matters under the NYSE rules for which brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote,\nTerminix does not expect there to be any broker non-votes at the Terminix special meeting.\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Terminix special meeting?\nThe preliminary voting results for the Terminix special meeting are expected to be announced at the\nTerminix special meeting. In addition, within four business days following the Terminix special meeting,\nTerminix will file the final voting results of the Terminix special meeting (or, if the final voting results\nhave not yet been certified, the preliminary results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nDo Terminix stockholders have dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights?\nYes. If you want to exercise appraisal rights and receive the fair value of shares of Terminix common\nstock in cash instead of the merger consideration, then you must file a written objection with Terminix\nprior to the Terminix special meeting stating, among other things, that you will exercise your right to\ndissent if the transaction is completed. Also, you may not vote in favor of the merger proposal and must\nfollow other procedures, both before and after the Terminix special meeting, as described in Annex C to\nthis proxy statement/prospectus. Note that if you return a signed proxy card without voting instructions\nor with instructions to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, then your shares will automatically be voted\n15 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nin favor of the merger proposal and you will lose all appraisal rights available under Delaware law. A\nsummary of these provisions can be found under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fShares Subject to Properly Exercised Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning\non page 139. Due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, Terminix\nstockholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal\ncounsel. Failure to strictly comply with the applicable Delaware law provisions will result in the loss of\nthe right of appraisal.\nAre there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the merger proposal?\nYes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section of this proxy\nstatement/\u200bprospectus entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page 37. You also should read and carefully\nconsider the risk factors with respect to Terminix that are contained in the documents that are\nincorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Terminix common stock after the record date but before the Terminix special\nmeeting?\nThe record date is earlier than the date of the Terminix special meeting. If you sell or otherwise transfer\nyour shares of Terminix common stock after the record date but before the Terminix special meeting, you\nwill, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the Terminix special meeting.\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nTerminix has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated (which we refer to as \u201cInnisfree\u201d) to assist in the\nsolicitation of proxies for the Terminix special meeting. Terminix estimates that it will pay Innisfree a fee\nof approximately $25,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Terminix has\nagreed to indemnify Innisfree against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its\nsolicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).\nTerminix also may be required to reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and\nfiduciaries or their respective agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial\nowners of Terminix common stock. Terminix\u2019s directors, officers and employees and Rentokil Initial\u2019s\ndirectors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in\nperson. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.\nWhen is the transaction expected to be completed?\nTerminix and Rentokil Initial expect to complete the transaction on October 12, 2022, assuming the\nmerger proposal is approved by Terminix stockholders on October 6, 2022 and the other conditions to\nclosing (described under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fConditions to Completion of the Transaction\u201d beginning on page 141) are satisfied (\nincluding approval of the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals by Rentokil Initial shareholders\non October 6, 2022). However, neither Terminix nor Rentokil Initial can predict the actual date on which\nthe transaction will be completed, or if the transaction will be completed at all, because completion of\nthe transaction is subject to conditions and factors outside the control of both companies. The merger\nagreement contains an end date of December 31, 2022, for the completion of the transaction, which may\nbe extended to March 13, 2023 by either Terminix or Rentokil Initial in certain circumstances, which we\nrefer to as the \u201cend date.\u201d See also the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\nProposal\u202f-\u202f Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction\u201d beginning on page 112.\nIs the completion of the transaction subject to any conditions?\nYes. Rentokil Initial and Terminix are not required to complete the transaction unless certain conditions\nare satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived). These conditions include, among\nothers, the adoption of the merger agreement by Terminix stockholders and the approval by Rentokil\nInitial shareholders of the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals. For a more complete summary of\nthe conditions that must be satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived) prior to\n16 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncompletion of the transaction, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fConditions to Completion of the Transaction\u201d beginning on page 141.\nWhat equity stake will Terminix stockholders hold in Rentokil Initial immediately following the transaction?\nBased on the number of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and shares of Terminix common stock\noutstanding on August 31, 2022, immediately after completion of the transaction, former Terminix\nstockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the transaction are expected to own Rentokil Initial\nADSs representing approximately 25.7% of the outstanding Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, and\nRentokil Initial shareholders immediately prior to the transaction are expected to own approximately\n74.3% of the outstanding Rentokil Initial ordinary shares. The relative ownership interests of Rentokil\nInitial shareholders and former Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the\ntransaction in Rentokil Initial immediately following the transaction will depend on the number of\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares and shares of Terminix common stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the transaction.\nIf I am a Terminix stockholder, how will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled?\nAs a holder of Terminix common stock in book-entry form, whether through DTC or otherwise, you will\nnot be required to take any specific actions to exchange your shares for the merger consideration. Your\nTerminix shares will, following the effective time of the first merger, be automatically exchanged for any\nRentokil Initial ADSs (in book-entry form) and/or cash (including any cash in lieu of any fractional\nRentokil Initial ADSs) to which you are entitled. More information may be found in the sections of this\nproxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d and \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u202f-\u202fNo Fractional ADSs\u201d beginning on pages 132 and 138, respectively.\nWill the Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued to me at the completion of the transaction be publicly traded on an\nexchange?\nYes. It is a condition to the completion of the transaction that the Rentokil Initial ADSs (and Rentokil\nInitial ordinary shares represented thereby) to be issued in connection with the transaction be approved\nfor listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. In addition, it is a condition that Rentokil\nInitial receive acknowledgement by the FCA of the approval of the application for the admission of\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by the Rentokil Initial ADSs to the premium listing segment\nof the FCA\u2019s official list, and acknowledgement by the LSE of the admission to trading of Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares represented by the Rentokil Initial ADSs on the LSE\u2019s main market for listed securities.\nTherefore, at the first effective time, all Rentokil Initial ADSs received by Terminix stockholders in\nconnection with the transaction will be listed on the NYSE (and are expected to trade under the symbol\n\u201cRTO\u201d) and may be traded on the exchange by stockholders.\nRentokil Initial ADSs received by Terminix stockholders in connection with the transaction will be freely\ntransferable, except for Rentokil Initial ADSs issued to any stockholder deemed to be an \u201caffiliate\u201d of\nRentokil Initial for purposes of U.S. federal securities law. For more information, see the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Proposal\u202f-\u202fRestrictions on Resales of Rentokil Initial ADSs Received in the Transaction\u201d\nbeginning on page 119.\nCan I elect to receive Rentokil Initial ordinary shares instead of Rentokil Initial ADSs?\nNo. Terminix stockholders may not elect to receive Rentokil Initial ordinary shares in lieu of any Rentokil\nInitial ADSs to which they are entitled in connection with the transaction. However, if Rentokil Initial\nADSs are issued to you, you will have the right, following the closing, to exchange those Rentokil Initial\nADSs for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, subject to the payment of any fees charged by the depositary\nbank relating to such exchange of Rentokil Initial ADSs for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and any\napplicable taxes and compliance with the other procedures set forth in the deposit agreement.\nFor a more detailed discussion about the exchange of Rentokil Initial ADSs for Rentokil Initial ordinary\nshares, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cDescription of Rentokil Initial\nAmerican Depositary Shares\u201d beginning on page 193.\n17 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHow will Rentokil Initial shareholders be affected by the transaction?\nUpon completion of the transaction, each Rentokil Initial shareholder will hold the same number of\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares that such stockholder held immediately prior to completion of the\ntransaction. As a result of the transaction, Rentokil Initial shareholders will own shares in a larger\nconsolidated company with more assets. However, because in connection with the transaction Rentokil\nInitial will be issuing Rentokil Initial ADSs to Terminix stockholders in exchange for their shares of\nTerminix common stock, each outstanding share of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares as of immediately\nprior to the transaction will represent a smaller percentage of the aggregate number of shares of Rentokil\nInitial ordinary shares outstanding after the transaction.\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction?\nThe obligation of Terminix to complete the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion\nfrom Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to Terminix, or Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, counsel to\nRentokil Initial, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and\nassumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the first merger and the second merger, taken\ntogether as an integrated transaction, will qualify (A) as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of\nSection 368(a) of the Code and (B) for an exception to the general rule of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code.\nAccordingly, on the basis of such opinion that the transaction qualifies as a reorganization and that the\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nAccordingly, on the basis of such opinion that the transaction qualifies as a reorganization and that the\ngeneral rule of Section 367(a)(1) does not apply, and assuming that, in the case of any holder who would\nbe treated as a \u201cfive-percent transferee shareholder\u201d  (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations\nSection 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Rentokil Initial following the transaction, such holder enters into a five-\nyear gain recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8:\na U.S. Holder that exchanges shares of Terminix common stock solely for Rentokil Initial ADSs in the\ntransaction will generally not recognize any gain or loss, except with respect to cash received in lieu\nof fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs\u037e\na U.S. Holder that exchanges shares of Terminix common stock solely for cash in the transaction will\ngenerally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and\nsuch U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such Terminix common stock\u037e and\na U.S. Holder that exchanges shares of Terminix common stock for a combination of Rentokil Initial\nADSs and cash in the transaction will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to\nthe lesser of: (i) the cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs, if any)\nreceived by such U.S. Holder in the transaction\u037e and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the cash (excluding\ncash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs, if any) plus the fair market value of the\nRentokil Initial ADSs (including any fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs deemed received) received by\nsuch U.S. Holder in exchange for its shares of Terminix common stock in the transaction, over (b)\nsuch U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of Terminix common stock exchanged.\nIn addition, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss with respect to any cash received in lieu\nof fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs.\nA Non-U.S. Holder exchanging its shares of Terminix common stock for the merger consideration\ngenerally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of the transaction.\nFor definitions of \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d and \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d and a more detailed discussion of the material\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders, see the\nsection of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Proposal\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Consequences\u201d beginning on page 121.\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Terminix\ncommon stock. A Terminix stockholder\u2019s tax consequences will depend on his, her or its individual\nsituation. Accordingly, each Terminix stockholder is urged to consult his, her or its tax advisors for a full\nunderstanding of the particular tax consequences of the transaction to such stockholder.\n18 \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhat are the important differences between a Rentokil Initial ordinary share and a Rentokil Initial ADS?\nEach Rentokil Initial ADS represents a beneficial interest in five Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.

            "text": "Risk Factors Summary (page 22)\nBelow is a summary of the principal risk factors that you should consider in deciding how to vote for the\nproposals presented in this proxy statement/prospectus. The below summary is qualified in its entirety by\nthe more complete discussion of such risks and uncertainties that follows this summary.\nRisks Relating to the Transaction\nBecause the market value of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares may fluctuate and the exchange ratio and\nper share cash amount are both fixed, Terminix stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the\nmerger consideration that they will receive in the transaction.\nCertain Terminix stockholders may receive a form or combination of consideration different from what\nthey elect.\nIf you make a cash/stock election, you will not be able to sell those shares unless you revoke your\nelection prior to the election deadline.\nThe market price for Rentokil Initial ADSs may be affected by different factors from those that\nhistorically have affected the market price of Terminix common stock.\nThere is no assurance when or if the transaction will be completed.\nCertain Terminix agreements may contain change of control or anti-assignment provisions that may be\ntriggered by the transaction and that, if acted upon or not waived, could cause the combined\ncompany to lose the benefit of such agreement(s) and incur liabilities or replacement costs, which\ncould have an adverse effect on the combined company.\nThe combined company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nBecause Rentokil Initial is a holding company and substantially all of its operations will be conducted\nthrough its subsidiaries, its ability to pay dividends on the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares depends\non its ability to obtain cash dividends or other cash payments or to obtain loans from such entities.\nThe announcement and pendency of the transaction could adversely affect each of Terminix\u2019s and\nRentokil Initial\u2019s respective businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nTerminix and Rentokil Initial will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the\ntransaction.\nThe transaction may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to Rentokil Initial\u2019s earnings per share,\nwhich may negatively affect the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the implied value\nof the Rentokil Initial ADSs following the transaction.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Terminix and Rentokil Initial is\npresented for illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of the results of operations or\nfinancial condition of the combined company following the transaction.\nRentokil Initial or Terminix may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting\nshareholder approval or stockholder approval, respectively.\nThe opinion of Terminix\u2019s financial advisor rendered to Terminix\u2019s board of directors does not reflect\nchanges in circumstances between the signing of the merger agreement and the completion of the\ntransaction.\nWhile the merger agreement is in effect, Terminix, Rentokil Initial and their respective subsidiaries\u2019\nbusinesses are subject to restrictions on their business activities.\nThe termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact Terminix.\nDirectors and executive officers of Terminix have interests in the transaction that may differ from the\ninterests of Terminix stockholders generally, including, if the transaction is completed, the receipt of\nfinancial and other benefits.\n22 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExcept in specified circumstances, if the transaction is not completed by December 31, 2022, subject\nto extension in specified circumstances by either Terminix or Rentokil Initial, either Terminix or\nRentokil Initial may choose not to proceed with the transaction.\nFollowing the closing, there may be less publicly available information concerning Rentokil Initial\nthan there is for issuers that are not foreign private issuers because, as a foreign private issuer,\nRentokil Initial would be exempt from a number of rules under the U.S. Exchange Act and would be\npermitted to file less information with the SEC than issuers that are not foreign private issuers and\nRentokil Initial, as a foreign private issuer, would be permitted to follow home country practice in lieu\nof the listing requirements of NYSE, subject to certain exceptions.\nRentokil Initial is organized under the laws of England and Wales and a substantial portion of its\nassets are, and many of its directors and officers reside, outside of the United States. As a result, it\nmay not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the\nUnited States against Rentokil Initial or Rentokil Initial\u2019s officers and members of the Rentokil Initial\nboard of directors.\nResales of Rentokil Initial ADSs following the transaction may cause the market value of Rentokil\nInitial ADSs to decline.\nAn active trading market for Rentokil Initial ADSs may not develop, which would adversely affect the\nliquidity and price of Rentokil Initial ADSs.\nThe Rentokil Initial ADSs and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares have different rights from the shares of\nTerminix common stock.\nCurrent Rentokil Initial shareholders and Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in\nthe transaction will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the transaction.\nTerminix is, and Rentokil Initial may become, the target of securities class actions and derivative\nlawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the transaction from being\ncompleted.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect\non the combined company\u2019s business and operations.\nThe transaction may affect the application of new or existing tax rules to the combined company,\nwhich could result in a material impact on the combined company\u2019s cash tax liabilities and tax charges.\nPrior to the completion of the transaction, Rentokil Initial and Terminix (and with effect from the\ncompletion of the transaction, the combined company) may have difficulty attracting, motivating and\nretaining executives and other employees in light of the transaction.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Rentokil Initial and Terminix\nto pursue alternatives to the transaction and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire\nTerminix for greater consideration than Rentokil Initial has agreed to pay.\nThe financial forecasts are based on various assumptions that may not be realized.\nExchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the foreign currency value of Rentokil Initial ADSs\nand any dividends.\nRisks Related to Rentokil Initial\u2019s Business\nRisks Relating to Business Strategies and Operations\nIf Rentokil Initial is unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions (including the transaction) or if its\ndisposals result in unexpected costs or liabilities, its business could be materially and adversely\naffected.\nRentokil Initial may experience difficulties integrating, streamlining and optimizing its IT systems,\nprocesses and technologies.\nRentokil Initial depends on a suitably skilled and qualified labor force to maintain the business.\nRentokil Initial depends on key personnel to lead Rentokil Initial\u2019s business.\n23 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022

reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nInflationary pressures, such as increases in wages, fuel prices and other operating costs, could\nadversely impact Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or\nprospects.\nSupply chain issues may result in product shortages or disruptions to Rentokil Initial\u2019s business.\nWeakening general economic conditions, including rising unemployment or decreased consumer\nconfidence or spending levels, especially as they may affect demand from Rentokil Initial\u2019s\ncustomers, may adversely impact its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or\nprospects.\nRentokil Initial may not successfully implement its business strategies, including achieving its growth\nobjectives.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s continued growth depends on its ability to retain existing customers and attract new\ncustomers.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s industries are highly competitive.\nCybersecurity breaches, attacks and other similar incidents, as well as disruptions or failures in\nRentokil Initial\u2019s IT systems or data security procedures and those of its third-party service\nproviders, could expose Rentokil Initial to liability, limit its ability to effectively monitor, operate and\ncontrol operations and adversely impact its business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and/or prospects.\nExtraordinary events may significantly impact Rentokil Initial\u2019s business if it is unable to ensure\nbusiness continuity due to a material incident.\nRentokil Initial may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property and other proprietary\nrights that are material to its business.\nRentokil Initial relies on third parties, including third-party vendors for business process outsourcing\ninitiatives, investment counterparties, and franchisees. Any termination or disruption of such\nrelationships or counterparty default or litigation could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nbusiness and reputation.\nRentokil Initial may be required to recognize impairment charges or be subject to asset revaluations or\ndowngrades.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Compliance Matters\nGovernment regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on\nRentokil Initial\u2019s financial results.\nTermite damage claims and lawsuits related thereto could increase Rentokil Initial\u2019s legal expenses\nand may adversely impact its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or\nprospects.\nCompliance with, or violation of, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including\nlaws pertaining to the use of pesticides, could result in significant costs that adversely impact\nRentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nRentokil Initial is required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and\nstandards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and\nsecurity. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these requirements could have a material\nadverse effect on its business.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could materially and adversely affect the taxes\nRentokil Initial pays and its profitability.\nThe completion of the transaction will result in Rentokil Initial becoming subject to U.S. regulations\nwhich differ from the regulations to which Rentokil Initial is currently subject. Current and future\n24 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nU.S. regulations could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, business and financial\nposition of Rentokil Initial following completion of the transaction.\nRisks Relating to Financing\nAdverse credit and financial market events and conditions could, among other things, impede access\nto or increase the cost of financing, which could have a material adverse impact on Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nThe agreements and instruments governing Rentokil Initial\u2019s indebtedness contain restrictions and\nlimitations that could impact Rentokil Initial\u2019s ability to operate its business.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings, outlook or watch assigned to its debt securities by rating\nagencies may increase Rentokil Initial\u2019s future borrowing costs and reduce its access to capital.\nThe additional indebtedness that Rentokil Initial will incur in connection with the completion of the\ntransaction could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s financial position, including by\ndecreasing Rentokil Initial\u2019s, and with effect from the consummation of the transaction, the combined\ncompany\u2019s, business flexibility and result in a decline in the combined company\u2019s credit rating.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing Rentokil Initial\u2019s debt and could\nadversely impact its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",

Following informal discussions with the FTC staff, Rentokil Initial\nnotified the FTC that it elected to withdraw and refile its notification and report form under the HSR Act prior\nto expiration of the initial waiting period to give the FTC additional time to review the transaction. Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s notification and report form was withdrawn effective as of February 9, 2022, and Rentokil Initial\nrefiled its notification on February 11, 2022, commencing a new 30-calendar-day waiting period under the\nHSR Act. The applicable HSR Act waiting period expired on March 14, 2022. Accordingly, as of March 15,\n2022, the condition to the closing of the transaction with respect to the expiration or early termination of the\nwaiting period relating to the transaction under the HSR Act has been satisfied.\nFor more information, see the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - \nConditions to Completion of the Transaction\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Efforts to Consummate the\nTransaction\u201d beginning on pages 141 and 154, respectively.",

            "text": "Litigation Related to the Transaction (page 114)\nOn March 25, 2022, in connection with its previously filed complaint on October 20, 2020, Bruce-Terminix\nCompany, a licensee of Terminix (\u201cBruce\u201d), filed a supplemental complaint against Terminix and The Terminix\nInternational Company Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of Terminix, under the caption Bruce-Terminix\nCompany v. The Terminix International Company Limited Partnership, and Terminix Global Holdings, Inc.,\nCivil Action No: 1:20-CV-962 (M.D.N.C.) (the \u201cBruce Lawsuit\u201d). The original complaint generally alleged,\namong other things, that certain subsidiaries of Terminix violated the non-compete restriction under the\nlicensee\u2019s license agreement and the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act. As\nsupplemented, the Bruce Lawsuit further generally alleges, among other things, that a Rentokil Initial\nsubsidiary currently competes in the licensee\u2019s territory and that the transaction would violate the non-\ncompete restriction under the licensee\u2019s license agreement. The Bruce Lawsuit also alleges, among other\nthings, that Bruce would suffer irreparable harm from purported competition with Rentokil Initial should the\ntransaction be consummated, and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from\nmerging with Rentokil Initial so long as Rentokil Initial owns pest control companies with locations within\nBruce\u2019s service area and from disclosing to Rentokil Initial certain confidential or proprietary information of\nthe Company. On August 1, 2022, the court denied Bruce\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the\ntransaction. Terminix believes that the claims asserted in the Bruce Lawsuit are without merit.\nIn connection with the transaction, three complaints have been filed by purported Terminix stockholders\nagainst Terminix and its directors, and one draft complaint has been sent to Terminix. The complaints are\ncaptioned Ferreiro v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-04987 (S.D.N.Y.)\u037e Justice v. Terminix\nGlobal Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-05519 (S.D.N.Y.)\u037e and Baker v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., et\nal., No. 1:22-cv-05524 (S.D.N.Y.). The draft complaint is captioned Paxton v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc.,\net al. and does not specify any court. The complaints and draft complaint generally allege that the\npreliminary registration statement filed with the SEC on June 7, 2022 omitted certain allegedly material\ninformation in connection with the transaction in violation of federal proxy laws, and one of the complaints\nfurther alleges that the Terminix directors further breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the\ntransaction and that Terminix aided and abetted that breach. The lawsuits seek various remedies, including:\nenjoining the consummation of the transaction\u037e rescission of the transaction, or rescissory damages in the\nevent the transaction is consummated without the allegedly material disclosures\u037e declaring the merger\nagreement unenforceable\u037e directing dissemination of additional allegedly material disclosures\u037e declaring that\nTerminix and its directors violated federal proxy laws\u037e awarding plaintiffs costs and an allowance for\n32",

            "text": "Risks Relating to the Transaction\nBecause the market value of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares may fluctuate and the exchange ratio and per share\ncash amount are both fixed, Terminix stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the merger consideration\nthat they will receive in the transaction.\nUpon completion of the transaction, Terminix stockholders will be entitled to receive for each share of\nTerminix common stock that they own, at the election of the holders of such shares and subject to certain\nallocation and proration provisions in the merger agreement described under the sections of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 132 and\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement - Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d\nbeginning on page 135, either (1) a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs (each representing a beneficial interest in\nfive Rentokil Initial ordinary shares) equal to (A) the exchange ratio plus (B) the quotient of the per share\ncash amount and the Rentokil Initial ADS price or (2) an amount in cash, without interest, and in U.S. dollars\nequal to (A) the per share cash amount plus (B) the product of the exchange ratio and the Rentokil Initial\nADS price. Based on Rentokil Initial\u2019s five-day average daily volume weighted share price and the five-day\naverage of the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in each case, over the period spanning December 6, 2021 to\nDecember 10, 2021, inclusive, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders as of the\ndate of announcement of the transaction was approximately $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock.\nBased on Rentokil Initial\u2019s volume weighted average share price and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange\nrate, in each case, as of August 31, 2022, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix\nstockholders was approximately $43.33 per share of Terminix common stock.\nBecause the exchange ratio and per share cash amount are both fixed, the value of the merger consideration\nwill depend on the Rentokil Initial ADS price as of the measurement day. The merger consideration will not be\nadjusted for changes in the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Terminix common stock or in\ncurrency exchange rates between the date of signing the merger agreement and the closing date. In addition,\nthere will be a lapse of time between the date on which Terminix stockholders vote on the merger proposal at\nthe Terminix special meeting and the date on which Terminix stockholders entitled to receive the merger\nconsideration actually receive the merger consideration.\nThe market value of the merger consideration and the market value of Terminix common stock at the first\neffective time may vary significantly from their respective values on the date that the merger agreement was\nexecuted or at other dates, such as the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Terminix\nspecial meeting, the measurement day or the date on which a Terminix stockholder actually receives the\nmerger consideration. These changes may result from a variety of factors, including changes in Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s or Terminix\u2019s respective businesses, operations or prospects, regulatory considerations and general\nbusiness, market, industry or economic conditions. The merger consideration will not be adjusted to reflect\nthe comparative value of pounds sterling and the U.S. dollar or the market value of Rentokil Initial ordinary\nshares or the Terminix common stock. Therefore, the aggregate market value of the merger consideration that\na Terminix stockholder is entitled to receive at the time that the transaction is completed could vary\nsignificantly from the value of the merger consideration on the date of this proxy statement/\n37 TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nprospectus, the date of the Terminix special meeting, the measurement day or the date on which a Terminix\nstockholder actually receives the merger consideration.\nRentokil Initial ordinary shareholders and Terminix stockholders are urged to obtain current market\nquotations for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock. See the section entitled\n\u201cComparative Per Share Market Price\u201d beginning on page 65 of this proxy statement/prospectus for more\ninformation about the market value of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock on certain\ndates.\nCertain Terminix stockholders may receive a form or combination of consideration different from what they elect.\nWhile each holder of Terminix common stock entitled to the merger consideration may elect to receive, in\nconnection with the transaction, either cash consideration or stock consideration, the total amount of cash\nand the total number of shares of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares (represented by Rentokil Initial ADSs)\navailable for all Terminix stockholders are fixed pursuant to the merger agreement. Accordingly, depending\non the elections made by other Terminix stockholders, if a holder of Terminix common stock elects to receive\nall cash in connection with the transaction, such holder may receive a portion of the merger consideration in\nRentokil Initial ADSs and if a holder of Terminix common stock elects to receive all Rentokil Initial ADSs in\nconnection with the transaction, such holder may receive a portion of the merger consideration in cash. See\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 132 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus for more information. For detailed illustrations of the potential allocation and proration\nof the merger consideration, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fAllocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning\non page 135. If a holder of Terminix common stock does not submit a properly completed and signed form of\nelection to the exchange agent by the election deadline, then such stockholder will be deemed to have\nelected to receive the stock consideration. No fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs will be issued in the\ntransaction, and Terminix stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs.\nIf you make a cash/stock election, you will not be able to sell those shares unless you revoke your election prior to\nthe election deadline.\nIf you are a holder of Terminix common stock and want to elect to receive the cash consideration or stock\nconsideration in exchange for your shares, you must deliver to the exchange agent by the election deadline a\nproperly completed form of election. Following the delivery of a completed form of election, you will not be\nable to transfer such shares of Terminix common stock unless you revoke your election before the election\ndeadline by providing an acceptable written notice to the exchange agent. If you do not revoke your election\nbefore the election deadline, you will not be able to liquidate your investment in Terminix common stock for\nany reason until you receive the merger consideration.\nThe market price for Rentokil Initial ADSs may be affected by different factors from those that historically have\naffected the market price of Terminix common stock.\nUpon completion of the transaction, Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the\ntransaction will become Rentokil Initial ADS holders. Rentokil Initial\u2019s businesses differ from those of\nTerminix, and, accordingly, the results of operations of Rentokil Initial will be affected by some factors that\nare different from those currently affecting the results of operations of Terminix. For a discussion of the\nbusinesses of Terminix and Rentokil Initial and of some important factors to consider in connection with\nthose businesses, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cBusiness of Rentokil Initial\u201d\nbeginning on page 234 and the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and\nreferred to in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional\nInformation\u201d beginning on page 328.\nThere is no assurance when or if the transaction will be completed.\nThe completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set\nforth in the merger agreement, including, among others, (i) the adoption of the merger agreement by the\n38 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naffirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Terminix common stock entitled to vote on\nthe merger proposal, (ii) affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by holders of outstanding\nordinary shares of Rentokil Initial at a duly convened and held meeting of Rentokil Initial\u2019s shareholders at\nwhich a quorum is present approving the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals, (iii) approval for\nlisting on the NYSE of the Rentokil Initial ADSs (and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented thereby) to\nbe issued in connection with the transaction, subject to official notice of issuance, (iv) acknowledgement by\nthe FCA of the approval of the application for the admission of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented\nby the Rentokil Initial ADSs to the premium listing segment of the official list, (v) acknowledgement by the\nFCA and the LSE of the admission of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by the Rentokil Initial\nADSs to the premium listing segment of the FCA\u2019s official list and to trading on the LSE\u2019s main market for\nlisted securities, (vi) the approval by the FCA of Rentokil Initial\u2019s prospectus (which will be combined with\nthe shareholder circular referenced below) and publication thereof in accordance with the prospectus\nregulation rules, (vii) the approval by the FCA of Rentokil Initial\u2019s shareholder circular (which will be\ncombined with the prospectus referenced above) and the distribution thereof to Rentokil Initial shareholders\nin accordance with the FCA\u2019s Listing Rules and the articles of association of Rentokil Initial, (viii) the\nabsence of any law, injunction or other order that prohibits or makes illegal the completion of the transaction,\n(ix) effectiveness of the registration statement for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to be issued in the\ntransaction (of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part) and of the registration statement on\nForm F-6 relating to the Rentokil Initial ADSs and the absence of any stop order suspending that\neffectiveness or any proceedings for that purpose pending before the SEC, and (x) other customary closing\nconditions, including the accuracy of each party\u2019s representations and warranties (subject to specified\nmateriality qualifiers), and each party\u2019s material compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in\nthe merger agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if\nat all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the transaction.\nCertain Terminix agreements may contain change of control or anti-assignment provisions that may be triggered by\nthe transaction and that, if acted upon or not waived, could cause the combined company to lose the benefit of such\nagreement(s) and incur liabilities or replacement costs, which could have an adverse effect on the combined\ncompany.\nTerminix is party to, or may become party to after the date hereof, various agreements with third parties that\nmay contain change of control or anti-assignment provisions that may be triggered upon the completion of\nthe transaction. Agreements with such provisions may provide for or permit the termination of the agreement\nupon the occurrence of a change of control of, or the assignment of such contract by, one of the parties\nunless it is waived by the relevant counterparties. In the event that there is such a contract or arrangement\nrequiring a consent or waiver in relation to the transaction or the merger agreement, for which such consent\nor waiver was not obtained, the combined company could lose the benefit of the underlying agreement and\nincur liabilities or replacement costs, which could have an adverse effect on the operations of the combined\ncompany.\nThe combined company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nThere is a risk that some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction may fail to materialize, or may not\noccur within the time periods anticipated by Rentokil Initial and Terminix. The realization of such benefits\nmay be affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond the control of Rentokil Initial and\nTerminix. The challenge of integrating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business\nand future financial prospects of the combined company following the transaction difficult. Terminix and\nRentokil Initial have operated and, until completion of the transaction, will continue to operate,\nindependently. The success of the transaction, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend,\nin part, on the ability to successfully integrate the operations of both companies in a manner that results in\nvarious benefits, including, among other things, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies that do\nnot materially disrupt existing customer relationships (including as a result of customer relationships based\non personal relationships being disrupted or lost due to personnel changes) nor result in decreased\nrevenues or dividends due to the full or partial loss of customers. The past financial performance of each of\nTerminix and Rentokil Initial may not be indicative of the future financial performance of the combined\ncompany.\n39 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFailure to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction may impact the financial performance of the\ncombined company, the price of the Rentokil Initial ADSs (and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented\nthereby) and the ability of the combined company to continue paying dividends on its ordinary shares at\nlevels per share consistent with the current dividend or at all. The declaration of dividends by the combined\ncompany will be at the discretion of its board of directors, which may determine at any time to cease paying\ndividends, lower the dividend level per share or not increase the dividend level per share.\nBecause Rentokil Initial is a holding company and substantially all of its operations will be conducted through its\nsubsidiaries, its ability to pay dividends on the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares depends on its ability to obtain cash\ndividends or other cash payments or to obtain loans from such entities.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited under English company law, which limits an English\ncompany to only pay cash dividends or make other distributions to the extent it has sufficient distributable\nreserves and cash available for this purpose. Rentokil Initial conducts substantially all of its operations\nthrough its subsidiaries and such entities will generate substantially all of its operating income and cash\nflow. As a holding company, Rentokil Initial\u2019s ability to pay dividends in the future is affected by a number of\nfactors, principally its ability to receive sufficient dividends from its subsidiaries. The ability of such entities\nto make dividend payments to Rentokil Initial depends largely on their financial condition and ability to\ngenerate profits. In addition, because Rentokil Initial\u2019s subsidiaries are, and the combined company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries will be, separate and distinct legal entities, they will have, to the extent they have not agreed\notherwise by entering into a separate agreement with Rentokil Initial, no obligation to pay any dividends or\nto lend or advance to Rentokil Initial funds and may be restricted from doing so by contract, including under\nfinancing arrangements, charter provisions, other shareholders or the applicable laws and regulations of the\nvarious countries in which they operate. Additionally, claims of the creditors of Rentokil Initial\u2019s subsidiaries\nhave (and will continue to have) priority over any claims that Rentokil Initial may have with respect to the\nassets of its subsidiaries. Although the combined company plans to remain committed to Rentokil Initial\u2019s\ncurrent progressive dividend policy, there can be no assurance that, in the long term, the combined\ncompany\u2019s subsidiaries will generate sufficient profits and cash flows, or otherwise prove willing or able, to\npay dividends or lend or advance to Rentokil Initial sufficient funds to enable it to pay interest, principal or\nexpenses to any third party, if any, or to enable it to declare and pay dividends, if any, on the Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares. The inability of one or more of the combined company\u2019s subsidiaries to pay dividends or\nlend or advance funds to Rentokil Initial could, in the long term, have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, cash flows, financial condition and the results of its operations.\nThe announcement and pendency of the transaction could adversely affect each of Terminix\u2019s and Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nrespective businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the transaction could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty\nsurrounding Terminix\u2019s and Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, including affecting Terminix\u2019s and Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nrelationships with existing and future customers and suppliers, which could have an adverse effect on\nTerminix\u2019s or Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects,\nregardless of whether the transaction is completed. Terminix and Rentokil Initial could also potentially lose\ncustomers or suppliers, and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased. In addition,\neach of Terminix and Rentokil Initial has expended, and continues to expend, significant management\nresources in an effort to complete the transaction, which are being diverted from Terminix\u2019s and Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s day-to-day operations.\nIf the transaction is not completed, Terminix\u2019s and Rentokil Initial\u2019s stock or share prices, as applicable, may\nfall if and to the extent that the current prices of Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares\nreflect a market assumption that the transaction will be completed. In addition, the failure to complete the\ntransaction may result in negative publicity or a negative impression of Terminix and Rentokil Initial in the\ninvestment community and may affect Terminix\u2019s and Rentokil Initial\u2019s relationship with employees,\ncustomers, suppliers and other partners in the business community.\nTerminix and Rentokil Initial will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the transaction.\nTerminix and Rentokil Initial have incurred and expect to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in\nconnection with the transaction and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger\n40 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nagreement, including costs relating to obtaining required approvals and in change in control payments.\nTerminix and Rentokil Initial have incurred significant financial services, accounting, tax and legal fees in\nconnection with the process of negotiating and evaluating the terms of the transaction. Additional\nsignificant unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of coordinating the businesses of Terminix and\nRentokil Initial after completion of the transaction. Even if the transaction is not completed, Terminix and\nRentokil Initial will need to pay certain costs relating to the transaction incurred prior to the date the\ntransaction was abandoned, such as financial advisory, accounting, tax, legal, filing and printing fees. Such\ncosts may be significant and could have an adverse effect on the parties\u2019 future results of operations, cash\nflows and financial condition.\nIn addition to its own fees and expenses, in the event the Terminix stockholders do not approve the matters\nrequired to be voted upon, and as a result the merger agreement is terminated, Terminix may be required to\npay by way of compensation an amount equal to $50 million to Rentokil Initial. In addition to its own fees\nand expenses, in the event the Rentokil Initial shareholders do not approve the matters required to be voted\nupon, and therefore the merger agreement is terminated, Rentokil Initial may be required to pay by way of\ncompensation an amount equal to $50 million to Terminix. Terminix may also be required to pay Rentokil\nInitial by way of compensation a termination payment of $200 million if the merger agreement is terminated\nunder the circumstances specified in the merger agreement, and Rentokil Initial may be required to pay\nTerminix by way of compensation a termination payment of $150 million if the merger agreement is terminated\nunder the circumstances specified in the merger agreement. For more information, see the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Payments and Expenses\u201d beginning on page 161.\nThe transaction may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to Rentokil Initial\u2019s earnings per share, which may\nnegatively affect the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the implied value of the Rentokil Initial\nADSs following the transaction.\nIn connection with the completion of the transaction, Rentokil Initial expects to issue approximately 643\nmillion new Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, in the form of Rentokil Initial ADSs, and certain Terminix equity\nawards are required to be converted into equity awards of Rentokil Initial pursuant to the merger agreement.\nThe issuance of new Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, in the form of Rentokil Initial ADSs, could have the\neffect of depressing the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.\nRentokil Initial currently projects that the transaction will result in a number of benefits, including increased\nscale and an enlarged platform for profitable growth, and that it will ultimately be accretive to Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s earnings per share. This projection is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change.\nFuture events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the\ntransaction being dilutive to Rentokil Initial\u2019s earnings per share, including adverse changes in market\nconditions, additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to\nrealize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the transaction. Any dilution of, reduction in or delay of any\naccretion to, Rentokil Initial\u2019s earnings per share could cause the price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and\nthe implied value of the Rentokil Initial ADSs to decline or grow at a reduced rate.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Terminix and Rentokil Initial is presented\nfor illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of the results of operations or financial condition of the\ncombined company following the transaction.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy\nstatement/\u200bprospectus has been prepared using the consolidated historical financial statements of Rentokil\nInitial and Terminix, is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered to be an\nindication of the results of operations or financial condition of the combined company following the\ntransaction. In addition, the pro forma combined financial information included in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the transaction. These assumptions\nmay not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the combined company\u2019s results of operations or\nfinancial condition following the transaction. Accordingly, the historical and pro forma financial information\nincluded in this proxy statement/prospectus does not necessarily represent the combined company\u2019s results\nof operations and financial condition had Terminix and Rentokil Initial operated as a combined entity during\nthe periods presented, or of the combined company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition following\ncompletion\n41 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof the transaction. The combined company\u2019s potential for future business success and operating profitability\nmust be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties that may be encountered by\nrecently combined companies.\nIn preparing the pro forma financial information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, Rentokil\nInitial has given effect to, among other items, the completion of the transaction, the payment of the merger\nconsideration and the indebtedness of Rentokil Initial on a consolidated basis after giving effect to the\ntransaction, including the indebtedness of Terminix. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not\nreflect all of the costs that are expected to be incurred by Terminix and Rentokil Initial in connection with the\ntransaction. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cRentokil\nInitial Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information,\u201d including the notes thereto, beginning on\npage 164.\nRentokil Initial or Terminix may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting shareholder\napproval or stockholder approval, respectively.\nCertain conditions to Rentokil Initial and Terminix\u2019s obligations, respectively, to complete the transaction\nmay be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally permissible, either unilaterally or by agreement by\neither Rentokil Initial or Terminix. In the event that any such waiver does not require resolicitation of\nRentokil Initial\u2019s shareholders or Terminix\u2019s stockholders or the amendment of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus or any re-solicitation of proxies or voting cards (as applicable), the parties will have\nthe discretion to complete the transaction without seeking further approval of Rentokil Initial shareholders or\nTerminix stockholders, as applicable.\nThe opinion of Terminix\u2019s financial advisor rendered to Terminix\u2019s Board of Directors does not reflect changes in\ncircumstances between the signing of the merger agreement and the completion of the transaction.\nTerminix\u2019s board of directors has received an opinion from Lazard dated December 13, 2021 to the effect that,\nas of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in\nLazard\u2019s written opinion, the merger consideration to be received in the transaction by holders of Terminix\ncommon stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, but has not obtained an updated\nopinion as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Changes in the operations and prospects of\nRentokil Initial or Terminix, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond\nthe control of Rentokil Initial or Terminix, and on which the forecasts and assumptions used by Terminix\u2019s\nfinancial advisors in connection with rendering its opinion may have been based, may significantly alter the\nvalue of Rentokil Initial or Terminix or the prices of the Rentokil Initial ADSs (and Rentokil Initial ordinary\nshares represented thereby) or of the shares of Terminix common stock by the time the transaction is\ncompleted. The opinion did not speak as of the time the transaction will be completed or as of any date other\nthan the date of such opinion and Terminix\u2019s board of directors does not anticipate asking its financial\nadvisor to update its opinion. The Terminix board of directors\u2019 recommendation that Terminix stockholders\nvote \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the merger proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the non-binding compensation advisory proposal,\nhowever, is made as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinion that\nTerminix\u2019s board of directors received from its financial advisor, see the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Proposal\u202f-\u202fOpinion of Terminix\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning\non page 89. A copy of the opinion of Lazard Fr\u00e8res & Co. LLC, Terminix\u2019s financial advisor, is attached as\nAnnex B to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\nWhile the merger agreement is in effect, Terminix, Rentokil Initial and their respective subsidiaries\u2019 businesses are\nsubject to restrictions on their business activities.\nUnder the merger agreement, Terminix, Rentokil Initial and their respective subsidiaries have agreed to\ncertain restrictions on the conduct of their respective businesses and generally must operate their respective\nbusinesses in the ordinary course prior to completing the transaction (unless Terminix or Rentokil Initial\nobtains the other\u2019s consent, as applicable, which is not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or\ndelayed), which may restrict Terminix\u2019s and Rentokil Initial\u2019s ability to exercise certain of their respective\nbusiness strategies. These restrictions may prevent Terminix and Rentokil Initial from pursuing otherwise\nattractive business opportunities, making certain investments or acquisitions, selling assets, engaging in\ncapital\n42 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexpenditures in excess of certain agreed limits, continuing share repurchase programs, incurring\nindebtedness or making changes to Terminix\u2019s and Rentokil Initial\u2019s respective businesses prior to the\ncompletion of the transaction or termination of the merger agreement, as applicable. These restrictions could\nhave an adverse effect on Terminix\u2019s and Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, financial results, financial condition or\nshare price.\nIn addition, the merger agreement prohibits Terminix and Rentokil Initial from (i) soliciting, initiating,\nknowingly facilitating or knowingly encouraging, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger\nagreement, any inquiry or the making or submission of any proposal or offer that constitutes an acquisition\nproposal (as defined for each party in the merger agreement), (ii) (A) entering into or participating in any\ndiscussions or negotiations with any third party, (B) furnishing to any third party any information, or (C)\notherwise assisting, participating in, knowingly facilitating or knowingly encouraging any third party, in each\ncase, in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating, an acquisition proposal,\nor (iii) approving, recommending or entering into (or publicly or formally proposing to approve, recommend\nor enter into), any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle with\nrespect to an acquisition proposal. Terminix may be required to pay Rentokil Initial by way of compensation a\ntermination payment of $200 million if the merger agreement is terminated under the circumstances specified\nin the merger agreement, and Rentokil Initial may be required to pay Terminix by way of compensation a\ntermination payment of $150 million if the merger agreement is terminated under the circumstances specified\nin the merger agreement.\nThese provisions may limit Terminix\u2019s ability to pursue offers from third parties that could result in greater\nvalue to Terminix stockholders than the merger consideration. The termination payment may also discourage\nthird parties from pursuing an alternative acquisition proposal with respect to Terminix.\nThe termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact Terminix.\nIf the transaction is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Terminix stockholders failing to\napprove the merger proposal, the ongoing businesses of Terminix may be adversely affected and, without\nrealizing any of the anticipated benefits of having completed the transaction, Terminix would be subject to a\nnumber of risks, including the following:\nTerminix may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including a decline of its stock\nprice (which may reflect a market assumption that the transaction will be completed)\u037e\nTerminix may experience negative reactions from the investment community, its customers, suppliers,\ndistributors, regulators and employees and other partners in the business community\u037e\nTerminix may be required to pay certain costs relating to the transaction, whether or not the\ntransaction is completed\u037e and\nmatters relating to the transaction will have required substantial commitments of time and resources\nby Terminix management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and\nother opportunities that may have been beneficial to Terminix had the transaction not been\ncontemplated.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated and the Terminix board of directors seeks another merger, business\ncombination or other transaction, Terminix stockholders cannot be certain that Terminix will find a party\nwilling to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the merger consideration Terminix\nstockholders would receive from Rentokil Initial in the transaction. If the merger agreement is terminated\nunder the circumstances specified in the merger agreement, Terminix may be required to pay Rentokil Initial\nby way of compensation a termination payment of $200 million or a no vote reimbursement of $50 million,\ndepending on the circumstances surrounding the termination. If the merger agreement is terminated under\nthe circumstances specified in the merger agreement, Rentokil Initial may be required to pay Terminix by way\nof compensation a termination payment of $150 million or a no vote reimbursement of $50 million, depending\non the circumstance surrounding the termination. If a no vote reimbursement is paid by Terminix or Rentokil\nInitial and the Terminix termination payment or Rentokil Initial termination payment subsequently becomes\ndue, then the amount of the Terminix or Rentokil Initial termination payment, as applicable, will be reduced by\nthe amount of no vote reimbursement expenses previously paid.\n43 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSee the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination of the\nMerger Agreement\u201d beginning on page 160 for a more complete discussion of the circumstances under which\nthe merger agreement could be terminated and when the termination payment and the no vote reimbursement\nmay be payable by Terminix or Rentokil Initial, as applicable.\nDirectors and executive officers of Terminix have interests in the transaction that may differ from the interests of\nTerminix stockholders generally, including, if the transaction is completed, the receipt of financial and other\nbenefits.\nIn considering the recommendation of the Terminix board of directors, you should be aware that Terminix\u2019s\ndirectors and executive officers may have interests in the transaction that are different from, or in addition to,\nthose of Terminix stockholders generally. These interests may include, among others, the treatment of\noutstanding Terminix equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement, the payment of severance benefits\nand acceleration of outstanding Terminix equity awards upon certain terminations of employment, and the\ncombined company\u2019s agreement to indemnify Terminix directors and executive officers against certain claims\nand liabilities. These interests are described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Proposal\u202f-\u202fInterests of Terminix\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction\u201d\nbeginning on page 105.\nExcept in specified circumstances, if the transaction is not completed by December 31, 2022, subject to extension in\nspecified circumstances by either Terminix or Rentokil Initial, either Terminix or Rentokil Initial may choose not to\nproceed with the transaction.\nEither Terminix or Rentokil Initial may terminate the merger agreement if the transaction has not been\ncompleted by December 31, 2022. However, this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available\nto Terminix or Rentokil Initial if such party\u2019s material breach of any of its obligations under the merger\nagreement has been the proximate cause of or resulted in the failure of the transaction to be completed on or\nbefore such time. The end date may be extended by Terminix or Rentokil Initial to March 13, 2023 if, at the\ntime of any such extension, the antitrust-related conditions are not satisfied but all other closing conditions\n(other than conditions that by their terms can only be satisfied at the closing if such conditions are\nreasonably capable of being satisfied on such date) have been satisfied or waived. For more information, see\nthe section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination of the Merger\nAgreement\u201d beginning on page 160.\nFollowing the closing, there may be less publicly available information concerning Rentokil Initial than there is for\nissuers that are not foreign private issuers because, as a foreign private issuer, Rentokil Initial would be exempt\nfrom a number of rules under the U.S. Exchange Act and would be permitted to file less information with the SEC\nthan issuers that are not foreign private issuers and Rentokil Initial, as a foreign private issuer, would be permitted\nto follow home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of NYSE, subject to certain exceptions.\nAs a foreign private issuer under the U.S. Exchange Act, Rentokil Initial would be exempt from certain rules\nunder the U.S. Exchange Act, and would not be required to file periodic reports and financial statements with\nthe SEC as frequently or as promptly as companies whose securities are registered under the U.S. Exchange\nAct but are not foreign private issuers, or to comply with Regulation FD, which restricts the selective\ndisclosure of material non-public information. In addition, Rentokil Initial would be exempt from certain\ndisclosure and procedural requirements applicable to proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the U.S.\nExchange Act. The members of the Rentokil Initial management board, officers and principal shareholders\nwould be exempt from the reporting and \u201cshort-swing\u201d profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the U.S.\nExchange Act. Accordingly, following the closing, there may be less publicly available information\nconcerning Rentokil Initial than there is for companies whose securities are registered under the U.S.\nExchange Act but are not foreign private issuers, and such information may not be provided as promptly as it\nis provided by such companies. In addition, certain information may be provided by Rentokil Initial in\naccordance with English law, which may differ in substance or timing from such disclosure requirements\nunder the U.S. Exchange Act.\nFurther, as a foreign private issuer, Rentokil Initial would be subject to less stringent corporate governance\nrequirements under the NYSE rules. Subject to certain exceptions, the rules of the NYSE\n44 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npermit a foreign private issuer to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of the\nNYSE, including, for example, certain internal controls as well as certain board, committee and director\nindependence requirements. Rentokil Initial would be required to disclose any significant way in which its\ncorporate governance practices differ from those followed by U.S. domestic companies under the NYSE\nlisting standings in its annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC or on its website. Accordingly, you may\nnot have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are required to comply with all of\nthe NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nRentokil Initial is organized under the laws of England and Wales and a substantial portion of its assets are, and\nmany of its directors and officers reside, outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for\nshareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States against Rentokil Initial or\nRentokil Initial\u2019s officers and members of the Rentokil Initial board of directors.\nRentokil Initial is organized under the laws of England and Wales. A substantial portion of Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nassets are located outside the United States, and many of Rentokil Initial\u2019s directors and officers and some of\nthe experts named in this proxy statement/prospectus are residents of jurisdictions outside of the United\nStates and the assets of such persons may be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be\ndifficult for investors to effect service within the United States upon Rentokil Initial and those directors,\nofficers and experts, or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against Rentokil Initial or such persons\neither inside or outside of the United States, or to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against Rentokil\nInitial or such persons in courts in jurisdictions outside the United States, in any action predicated upon the\ncivil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.\nThere is no certainty that civil liabilities predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United\nStates can be enforced in England, whether by original action or by seeking to enforce a judgment of U.S.\ncourts. In addition, punitive damages awards in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be\nunenforceable in England.\nResales of Rentokil Initial ADSs following the transaction may cause the market value of Rentokil Initial ADSs to\ndecline.\nRentokil Initial expects that it will issue up to approximately 643 million Rentokil Initial ordinary shares at the\nfirst effective time in connection with the transaction. The issuance of these new Rentokil Initial ordinary\nshares and the new Rentokil Initial ADSs by which those Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are represented,\nand the sale of Rentokil Initial ADSs from time to time (and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented\nthereby) could have the effect of depressing the market value for Rentokil Initial ADSs (and Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares represented thereby) as a consequence of the transaction. The increase in the number of\nRentokil Initial ADSs may lead to sales of such Rentokil Initial ADSs or the perception that such sales may\noccur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market value of, Rentokil Initial ADSs.\nAn active trading market for Rentokil Initial ADSs may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and\nprice of Rentokil Initial ADSs.\nThe existing Rentokil Initial ADSs are not listed on any U.S. stock exchange. Following the closing, an active\ntrading market for the Rentokil Initial ADSs may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. If an\nactive public market for Rentokil Initial ADSs does not develop, the market price and liquidity of Rentokil\nInitial ADSs may be adversely affected. Rentokil Initial shareholders may be unable to sell their Rentokil\nInitial ADSs unless a market can be established and sustained.\nThe Rentokil Initial ADSs and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares have different rights from the shares of Terminix\ncommon stock.\nCertain of the rights associated with Terminix common stock are different from the rights associated with\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cComparison of\nRights of Rentokil Initial Shareholders and Terminix Stockholders\u201d beginning on page 211 for a discussion\nof the different rights associated with Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock. In\naddition, holders of Rentokil Initial ADSs will be able to exercise the shareholder rights for Rentokil Initial\n45 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nordinary shares represented by such Rentokil Initial ADSs through the depositary bank, only to the extent\ncontemplated by the deposit agreement. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement/\u200b\nprospectus entitled \u201cDescription of Rentokil Initial American Depositary Shares\u201d beginning on page 202.\nIn particular, the laws of England and Wales, the jurisdiction in which Rentokil Initial is incorporated, limit\nthe circumstances under which shareholders of a company may bring derivative actions on behalf of that\ncompany. In most cases, only the corporation may be the claimant or plaintiff for the purposes of maintaining\nproceedings in respect of any wrongful act committed against it and the permission of the court is required\nto maintain any derivative action, which is able to be brought by shareholders. In addition, the laws of\nEngland and Wales do not afford appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders in the form typically available to\nshareholders of a U.S. corporation. English law also requires that shareholders approve certain capital\nstructure decisions (including the allotment and issuance of shares, the exclusion of preemptive rights and\nshare repurchases), which may limit Rentokil Initial\u2019s flexibility to manage its capital structure.\nIn addition, only registered holders of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are afforded the rights of shareholders\nunder English law and the Rentokil Initial articles of association. Because the depositary bank holds Rentokil\nInitial ordinary shares represented by Rentokil Initial ADSs through a custodian which is a participant in the\nCREST securities settlement system (\u201cCREST\u201d), and CREST or its nominee is the registered holder of\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by Rentokil Initial ADSs, the holders of Rentokil Initial ADSs\nmust rely on the depositary bank to exercise the rights of a shareholder via its custodian and CREST.\nHolders of Rentokil Initial ADSs are entitled to present Rentokil Initial ADSs to the depositary bank for\ncancellation and withdraw the corresponding number of underlying Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, but\nwould be responsible for fees relating to such exchange. Fees and charges are also payable by Rentokil\nInitial ADS holders in relation to certain other depositary services.\nCurrent Rentokil Initial shareholders and Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the\ntransaction will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the transaction.\nUpon completion of the transaction, Rentokil Initial expects to issue approximately 129 million Rentokil Initial\nADSs to Terminix stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement. As a result, it is expected that, immediately\nafter completion of the transaction, former Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the\ntransaction will own approximately 25.7% of the outstanding Rentokil Initial ordinary shares. In addition,\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares may be issued from time to time following the first effective time to holders of\nTerminix equity awards on the terms set forth in the merger agreement. See the sections of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Proposal\u202f-\u202fInterests of Terminix\u2019s Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Transaction,\u201d \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTreatment of Terminix Equity Awards\u201d and \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTreatment of Terminix Employee Stock Purchase Plan\u201d beginning on pages 105, 139\nand 140, respectively, for a more detailed explanation.\nTerminix is, and Rentokil Initial may become, the target of securities class actions and derivative lawsuits which\ncould result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the transaction from being completed.\nAs at the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, three securities stockholder derivative lawsuits have been\nbrought against Terminix and its board of directors and one draft complaint has been sent to Terminix. Such\nlawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits\nare without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time\nand resources. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation\nof the transaction, then that injunction may delay or prevent the transaction from being completed. Given the\nearly stage of the existing proceedings, it is impossible to predict the outcome or estimate possible loss or\nrange of loss.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined\ncompany\u2019s business and operations.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation from holders of Rentokil Initial ADSs or\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares, customers, suppliers, consumers and other third parties due to the\n46 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncombination of Rentokil Initial\u2019s business and Terminix\u2019s business following the transaction. For information\nregarding such litigation, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\nProposal\u202f-\u202fLitigation Related to the Transaction\u201d beginning on page 114. Such litigation may have an\nadverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations or may cause disruptions to\nthe combined company\u2019s operations.\nThe transaction may affect the application of new or existing tax rules to the combined company, which could result\nin a material impact on the combined company\u2019s cash tax liabilities and tax charges.\nChanges in tax regimes, such as those that have been proposed by the current administration in the United\nStates that include raising the corporate tax rate and raising the tax rate on global intangible low-taxed\nincome, could result in a material impact on the cash tax liabilities and tax charges of the combined company.\nThe Rentokil Initial group will have a greater presence in the United States following the acquisition of\nTerminix than the existing Rentokil Initial group, which means that changes to tax rules in the United States\ncould have a more significant impact. Such an impact could also arise from changes in the application of\nexisting tax rules, including UK tax rules, to the Rentokil Initial group as a result of the transaction. In either\ncase, this could result in a reduction in financial results depending upon the nature of the change.\nPrior to the completion of the transaction, Rentokil Initial and Terminix (and with effect from the completion of the\ntransaction, the combined company) may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other\nemployees in light of the transaction.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s success after the transaction will depend in part on its ability to retain key executives and\nother employees. Uncertainty about the effect of the transaction on Rentokil Initial and Terminix employees\nmay have an adverse effect on each of Rentokil Initial and Terminix and consequently on the combined\ncompany. This uncertainty may impair, prior to the completion of the transaction, Rentokil Initial\u2019s and/or\nTerminix\u2019s, and following the completion of the transaction, the combined company\u2019s, ability to attract, retain\nand motivate personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the\ntransaction, as employees of Rentokil Initial and Terminix may experience uncertainty about their future roles\nin the combined company.\nAdditionally, Terminix\u2019s officers and employees may hold shares of Terminix common stock and/or certain\nequity awards, and, if the transaction is completed, these officers and employees may be entitled to the\nmerger consideration in respect of such shares of Terminix common stock and/or certain equity awards.\nUnder agreements between Terminix and certain of its employees, such employees could potentially resign\nfrom employment on or after the first effective time that could result in severance payments to such\nemployees and accelerated vesting of their equity awards. These payments and accelerated vesting benefits,\nindividually or in the aggregate, could make retention of Terminix employees more difficult.\nFurthermore, if employees of Rentokil Initial or Terminix depart or are at risk of departing, including because\nof issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become\nemployees of the combined company, Rentokil Initial may have to incur significant costs in retaining such\nindividuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose\nsignificant expertise and talent. As a result, the combined company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated\nbenefits of the transaction may be materially and adversely affected. No assurance can be given that the\ncombined company will be able to attract or retain employees to the same extent that Terminix has been able\nto attract or retain employees in the past.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Rentokil Initial and Terminix to pursue\nalternatives to the transaction and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Terminix for greater\nconsideration than Rentokil Initial has agreed to pay.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Terminix to sell its business to a\nparty other than Rentokil Initial, or for Rentokil Initial to pursue alternatives to the transaction. These\nprovisions include a general prohibition on each party soliciting any acquisition proposal. Further, there are\nonly limited exceptions to each party\u2019s agreement that its board of directors will not withdraw or modify in a\nmanner adverse to the other party the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the adoption of\nthe merger agreement. In the event that either the Terminix board of directors or the Rentokil\n47 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInitial board of directors make an adverse recommendation change, then Terminix and Rentokil Initial may be\nrequired to pay to the other party by way of compensation a termination payment of $200 million and $150\nmillion, respectively. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fNo Solicitation\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202f\nTermination Payments and Expenses\u201d beginning on pages 150 and 161, respectively, of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\nThe parties believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers, but these restrictions\nmight discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of either Terminix or\nRentokil Initial from considering or proposing an acquisition proposal, even if that party were prepared to\npay consideration with a higher per-share value than the currently proposed merger consideration, in the\ncase of Terminix, or that party were prepared to enter into an agreement that may be favorable to Rentokil\nInitial or its shareholders, in the case of Rentokil Initial. Furthermore, the termination payments described\nabove may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per-share price to acquire the\napplicable party than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the\ntermination payment that may become payable by such party in certain circumstances.\nThe financial forecasts are based on various assumptions that may not be realized.\nThe financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the section \u201cThe Merger Proposal\u202f-\u202fCertain\nTerminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d were based on assumptions of, and information\navailable to, Terminix\u2019s management when prepared and these estimates and assumptions are subject to\nuncertainties, many of which are beyond Terminix\u2019s control and may not be realized. Many factors mentioned\nin this proxy statement/prospectus, including the risks outlined in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and the\nevents or circumstances described under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d\nwill be important in determining the combined company\u2019s future results. As a result of these contingencies,\nactual future results may vary materially from the estimates. In view of these uncertainties, the inclusion of\nfinancial estimates in this proxy statement is not and should not be viewed as a representation that the\nforecasted results will necessarily reflect actual future results.\nThe financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the section \u201cThe Merger Proposal\u202f-\u202fCertain\nTerminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d were not prepared with a view toward public\ndisclosure, and such financial estimates were not prepared with a view toward compliance with published\nguidelines of any regulatory or professional body. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of\nthe date on which it is made, and Terminix does not undertake any obligation, other than as required by\napplicable law, to update the financial estimates herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date those\nfinancial estimates were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or\ncircumstances. The prospective financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is\nthe responsibility of, Terminix management.

            "text": "Risks Related to Rentokil Initial\u2019s Business\nRisks Relating to Business Strategies and Operations\nIf Rentokil Initial is unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions (including the transaction) or if its disposals result in\nunexpected costs or liabilities, its business could be materially and adversely affected.\nRentokil Initial has a strategy that includes growth by acquisition, for example it acquired 52 new businesses\nin 2021. M&A activity is a core part of Rentokil Initial\u2019s strategy to extend its geographic footprint and to\nimprove its market share in existing locations, and Rentokil Initial may continue to pursue strategic\ntransactions in the future, which could involve acquisitions or disposals of businesses or assets. There are a\nnumber of risks to the successful integration of acquired businesses. These risks include the possibility that\nmanagement may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and that\nunforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and retaining and assimilating the\nemployees. In addition, even where a diligent review of the businesses and/or properties acquired in\nconnection with such acquisitions is performed in accordance with industry norms, such reviews may be\nincomplete and not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems, including actual or contingent\nliabilities, or permit a full assessment of the deficiencies associated with the businesses or properties. Any\nacquisition that Rentokil Initial makes may not provide it with the benefits that were anticipated when\nacquisition that Rentokil Initial makes may not provide it with the benefits that were anticipated when\nentering into such acquisition. If Rentokil Initial fails to (i) successfully integrate acquisitions into its\nexisting organizational structures\u037e (ii) deliver the revenue and profit targets\u037e or (iii) deliver any expected\nsynergy benefits such as cost savings, the acquired business may not achieve the expected financial and\noperational benefits which could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. There is a risk that\nthe transaction and integration of Rentokil Initial and Terminix may consume management time and\nresources, making the execution of M&A activity in furtherance of the combined company\u2019s strategy more\ndifficult to execute.\nIn addition, Rentokil Initial has sold a number of its businesses in the past and expects to continue to\ndispose of businesses from time to time if consistent with its strategy. Furthermore, under business sale\ncontracts, Rentokil Initial may provide warranties and indemnities to purchasers. Accordingly, Rentokil Initial\nmay make provisions in its consolidated financial statements for potential liabilities and costs relating to a\ndisposed business. Rentokil Initial may also make provision in its financial statements for amounts to cover\nlegal or regulatory claims which are known to be outstanding at the time of sale or which may subsequently\nbecome apparent. There can be no assurance that such provisions will be sufficient to cover potential\nliabilities and consequently disposals of Rentokil Initial\u2019s businesses may have a material adverse effect on\nits business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nRentokil Initial may experience difficulties integrating, streamlining and optimizing its IT systems, processes and\ntechnologies.\nRentokil Initial has invested in, and expects to continue to invest in, a wide range of new systems, processes\nand technologies intended to improve many aspects of its business. These systems, processes and\ntechnologies impact customers, suppliers, employees and others, including new systems that integrate,\nstreamline and enhance legacy operating IT systems. These activities have required, and may continue to\n49 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nrequire, significant investment of human and financial resources. Rentokil Initial may experience significant\ndelays, increased costs and other difficulties as a consequence of significant disruption or deficiency in\nimplementing such systems, processes and technologies, which could adversely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nability to process work orders, send invoices and track and collect payments, fulfill contractual obligations\nor otherwise operate its business. In addition, Rentokil Initial\u2019s efforts to centralize various business\nprocesses within its organization in connection with this implementation may disrupt operations and\nnegatively impact Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or\nprospects. Rentokil Initial may also experience difficulties, costs or delays in migrating acquired businesses\nto its systems, processes and technologies.\nRentokil Initial depends on a suitably skilled and qualified labor force to maintain the business.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s ability to maintain its customer service and execute its business strategy depends on its\nability to attract and retain a suitably skilled and qualified labor force. There can be no assurance that\nRentokil Initial will be able to recruit, train and retain such a labor force in sufficient numbers or of sufficient\nquality, or that pressure to recruit will not lead to a significant increase in employee costs. In markets where\noverall employment rates are high, and/or its business is growing quickly either organically or through\nacquisitions, Rentokil Initial may have difficulties attracting, training and retaining operational personnel of\nsuitable capability. In addition, changes in the global job market (including those caused or accelerated by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic) may cause (or continue to cause) difficulty in recruiting, training and retaining a\nsuitably skilled and qualified labor force. As a result, Rentokil Initial could experience difficulty in\nresponding to customer calls in a timely fashion or delivering its services in a high-quality or timely manner,\nand could be forced to increase wages to attract, train and retain colleagues, which would result in higher\noperating costs and reduced profitability. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on\nRentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nMoreover, some of Rentokil Initial\u2019s colleagues are members of local trade unions and similar organizations.\nIndustrial action in key operations could result in diminished customer service levels or higher costs and, if\nprolonged, could damage Rentokil Initial\u2019s reputation and ability to retain existing customers or acquire new\ncustomers. Although Rentokil Initial believes that all of Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations have good relations with\ntheir colleagues and the trade unions that represent those colleagues (where applicable), there can be no\nassurance that work stoppages or other labor-related developments (including the introduction of new labor\nregulations in countries where Rentokil Initial operates) will not adversely affect its business, reputation,\nresults of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. In addition, potential competition from key\ncolleagues who leave Rentokil Initial could impact its ability to maintain its market share in certain\ngeographic areas.\nRentokil Initial depends on key personnel to lead Rentokil Initial\u2019s business.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s continued success will largely depend on its ability to attract, retain and develop a high\ncaliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of its executive officers and certain other key colleagues. As\nRentokil Initial continues to grow its business, make acquisitions, expand its geographic scope and offer new\nproducts and services, Rentokil Initial needs the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective\nsuccession for executive officer and key colleague roles in order to meet the growth, development and\nprofitability goals of its business. Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations could be materially and adversely affected if\nfor any reason Rentokil Initial was unable to attract, retain or develop such officers or key colleagues and\nsuccessfully execute organizational change and management transitions at leadership levels.\nESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nIncreased focus and activism related to ESG matters may hinder Rentokil Initial\u2019s access to capital, as\ninvestors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of Rentokil Initial\u2019s ESG\npractices. Customers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on ESG issues,\nincluding climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, human and animal health and welfare,\nchemical usage and other concerns. Changing customer preferences are resulting in, and may continue to\n50 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nresult in, increased demands regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-\nrecyclable plastic packaging, and other components of Rentokil Initial\u2019s products and their impact on human\nand animal health and environmental sustainability\u037e a growing demand for natural, organic or non-toxic\nproducts and ingredients\u037e or increased customer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate)\nregarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain products. Certain animal welfare\nadvocacy groups may raise concerns regarding products such as glue boards or snap traps perceived to\nhave animal cruelty issues. These demands, perceptions and preferences could cause Rentokil Initial to incur\nadditional costs or to make changes to its operations to comply with such demands and customer\npreferences, and a delay in Rentokil Initial\u2019s response (or the failure to respond effectively) may lead to\nadverse effects to its business, results of operations and financial condition, and recruitment and retention\nof the labor force that it needs.\nConcern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials, in particular, may result in new or increased\nlegal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Increased regulatory\nrequirements, including in relation to various aspects of ESG including disclosure requirements, may result in\nincreased compliance costs or input costs of energy and raw materials, which may cause disruptions in the\nmanufacture of Rentokil Initial\u2019s products or an increase in operating costs, and these costs could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. Any failure to achieve its\nESG goals or a perception (whether or not valid) of its failure to act responsibly with respect to ESG issues or\nto effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or\nother ESG matters, or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation could\nadversely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operation, financial condition and/or\nprospects. In addition, Rentokil Initial may also be adversely impacted as a result of conduct by contactors,\ncustomers or suppliers that fail to meet Rentokil Initial\u2019s or its stakeholders\u2019 ESG standards.\nInflationary pressures, such as increases in wages, fuel prices and other operating costs, could adversely impact\nRentokil Initial\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s financial performance may be adversely affected by sudden or material increases in the level\nof its operating costs and expenses, which may be subject to inflationary pressures, and it may not be able\nto pass these increases on fully, or in a timely manner, to customers. For example, fuel prices are subject to\nmarket volatility, and Rentokil Initial\u2019s fleet has been negatively impacted by significant increases in fuel\nprices in the past and could be negatively impacted in the future. In addition, Rentokil Initial continues to\nmonitor any adverse impact that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the subsequent institution and\nextension of sanctions against various Russian organizations, companies and individuals may have on the\nglobal economy in general and on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business operations, although Rentokil Initial has no\ndirect operations in Russia or the Ukraine. Such events have increased fuel prices, and a prolonged conflict\nmay have further negative consequences such as increased inflation and transportation costs. Fuel price\nincreases have also caused increases in the cost of chemicals and other materials used in Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nbusiness. Increases in fuel, and other costs, have not negatively affected Rentokil Initial\u2019s results of\noperations as of June 30, 2022, as Rentokil Initial has been able to pass along such increases to customers in\nthe form of increased prices. However, Rentokil Initial cannot predict the extent to which it may experience\nfuture cost increases. To the extent such costs increase further, Rentokil Initial may be prevented, in whole\nor in part, from passing these cost increases on to its existing and prospective customers, which could have\na material adverse impact on Rentokil Initial\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nSupply chain issues may result in product shortages or disruptions to Rentokil Initial\u2019s business.\nRentokil Initial has a complex global network of suppliers that has recently expanded to meet increased\ncustomer demand and may, in the future, further evolve in response to market conditions. Although the\nmajority of the products used by Rentokil Initial are generally available from multiple sources, and\nalternatives have been generally available in the event of disruption in the past, Rentokil Initial could\nexperience material disruptions in production and other supply chain issues (including as a result of current\nglobal supply issues affecting microchips and printed circuit boards), which could result in out-of-stock\nconditions, and its results of operations and relationships with customers could be adversely affected (a) if\nnew or existing suppliers are unable to meet any standards set by Rentokil Initial, government or industry\nregulations or customers, (b) if Rentokil Initial is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity, quality\nand price\n51 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nlevels needed for its business, or (c) if any of Rentokil Initial\u2019s key suppliers becomes insolvent, ceases or\nsignificantly reduces its operations or experiences financial distress.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s inability to fully or substantially meet customer demand due to supply chain issues could\nresult in, among other things, unmet consumer demand leading to reduced preference for Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nproducts or services in the future, customers purchasing products and services from competitors as a result\nof such shortage of products, strained customer relationships, termination of customer contracts, additional\ncompetition and new entrants into the market, and loss of potential sales and revenue, which could\nadversely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or\nprospects.\nWeakening general economic conditions, including rising unemployment or decreased consumer confidence or\nspending levels, especially as they may affect demand from Rentokil Initial\u2019s customers, may adversely impact its\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nOngoing volatility in the global economic environment has led to, and may continue to lead to, economic\nchallenges such as low gross domestic product growth in regional and national economies, high volatility in\ncommodity prices and exchange rates and efforts made by governments to increase the minimum wage\nacross markets, as well as wide variations in local market prices and cost inflation across the globe. This may\nbe exacerbated by economic uncertainty caused by geopolitical events, political instability and civil unrest in\nsome local markets, catastrophic business events, including the continuation and/or broadening of the\nconflict in the Ukraine and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further economic slowdown in the markets\nin which Rentokil Initial operates may lead to a reduction in the level of demand from its customers for\nexisting and new services. Low-growth economies with inherent cost inflation may make it difficult for\nRentokil Initial to maintain profitability if it has weak pricing power in those markets, in particular, if there are\nstrong competitive pressures. Furthermore, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of\ncustomers not renewing contracts or seeking to reduce prices leading to a reduction in profit margins and\ncash flows or being unable to pay for existing or additional services leading to an increase in bad debts. Any\nof these events could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of\noperations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nRentokil Initial may not successfully implement its business strategies, including achieving its growth objectives.\nRentokil Initial may not be able to fully implement its business strategies or realize, in whole or in part within\nthe expected time frames, the anticipated benefits of various growth or other initiatives. Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nability to implement its business strategy may be adversely affected by factors that Rentokil Initial cannot\ncurrently foresee, such as unanticipated costs and expenses, technological change, severe economic\ndownturn (including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the conflict in Ukraine), the\nlevel of interest rates, foreign exchange risks, failure to integrate acquisitions, a decline in the effectiveness\nof Rentokil Initial\u2019s marketing (including digital marketing) activities or disruptions in the supply chain. All of\nthese factors may necessitate changes to Rentokil Initial\u2019s business strategy or adversely affect its business,\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nIn addition, Rentokil Initial will incur certain costs to achieve efficiency improvements, systems\nimplementations and growth in Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, and Rentokil Initial may not meet anticipated\nimplementation timetables or stay within budgeted costs. As these efficiency improvements, system\nimplementations and growth initiatives are implemented, Rentokil Initial may not fully achieve expected cost\nsavings and efficiency improvements, system implementations or growth rates, or these initiatives could\nadversely impact customer retention or its operations. Also, Rentokil Initial\u2019s business strategies may\nchange in light of its ability to implement new business initiatives, competitive pressures, economic\nuncertainties or developments or other factors.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s continued growth depends on its ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s ability to grow is dependent on its ability to retain existing customers and attract new\ncustomers. There can be no assurance that Rentokil Initial\u2019s strategy of using new technology and improved\nsales techniques to attract profitable new clients, up-selling and cross-selling to existing clients and\nfocusing on retaining profitable business when renewing existing consumer contracts will be successful.\nMoreover,\n52 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfailure to maintain customer service, client management and sales capability, failure to adapt to local\nbusiness and consumer needs and/or failure to win and retain profitable customers in the face of competition\nfrom competitors with lower costs or which are willing to accept lower margins may have a material adverse\neffect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Rentokil\nInitial must be sufficiently agile to develop and deliver products and services that meet local market needs. If\nRentokil Initial is not able to adapt to local business and consumer needs, its existing customers may choose\nnot to renew contracts, reduce the use of Rentokil Initial\u2019s services across their operations or seek\nreductions in prices.\nRentokil Initial must continue to develop products and services that meet the needs and expectations of its\ncustomer base, including to ensure the continued efficacy of its products in the target pest population.\nFurthermore, as technological developments disrupt the markets in which Rentokil Initial operates and\nchanges service offerings across its industries, Rentokil Initial may need to develop new products and\nservices. In the future, products and services may interact with each other in new ways and offer new\ncapabilities to consumers, such as systems that are networked and able to be monitored in real time. Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s competitors may be earlier to embrace these new technological developments that are disruptive to\nthe market or to develop more effective products, and a delay in Rentokil Initial\u2019s response may lead to\nadverse effects to its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s industries are highly competitive.\nRentokil Initial competes with a wide variety of competitors of varying sizes and faces competition in many\nof the markets in which it operates. The growing presence of multinational competitors may increase the cost\nof acquisitions and/or drive down prices, impacting Rentokil Initial\u2019s profitability. Furthermore, the increased\npresence of facilities management companies in the markets in which Rentokil Initial operates may also drive\ndown prices and adversely impact the quality of relationships with end customers. The principal methods of\ncompetition in Rentokil Initial\u2019s business include quality and speed of customer service, brand awareness\nand reputation, effective use of technology and systems, customer satisfaction, fairness of contract terms\n(including price and promotions), professional sales forces and referrals. Rentokil Initial may be unable to\ncompete successfully against current or future competitors, and the competitive pressures that Rentokil\nInitial faces may result in reduced market share, reduced pricing or an adverse impact on its reputation,\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nCybersecurity breaches, attacks and other similar incidents, as well as disruptions or failures in Rentokil Initial\u2019s IT\nsystems or data security procedures and those of its third-party service providers, could expose Rentokil Initial to\nliability, limit its ability to effectively monitor, operate and control operations and adversely impact its business,\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s business is dependent on effective IT systems and data security procedures. Rentokil Initial\nand its third-party service providers may be subject to significant system or network disruptions from\nnumerous causes, including cybersecurity breaches, attacks or other similar incidents, facility access issues,\nnew system implementations, human error, fraud, theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a\nsimilar catastrophic event. Moreover, computer viruses, worms, malware, ransomware, phishing, spoofing,\nmalicious or destructive code, social engineering, denial-of-service attacks, and other cyberattacks have\nbecome more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. Because the techniques used by computer hackers\nand others to access or sabotage networks and computer systems constantly evolve and generally are not\nrecognized until launched against a target, Rentokil Initial and its third-party service providers may be\nunable to anticipate, detect, react to, counter or mitigate against all of these techniques or remediate any\nresulting incident. Cybersecurity risk has increased due to increased online and remote activity (a trend\naccelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic) and Rentokil Initial experienced a notable increase in the number and\nseriousness of cyberattacks, including repeated distributed denial of service attacks and attempted\nransomware incidents in countries such as Brazil and Italy. The attacks were detected and prevented before\nthey were able to have a material impact on the business, but it is possible that future cyberattacks could\navoid detection or prevention and have such a material impact.\nAny IT system disruptions or breaches may lead to unauthorized release of data and inefficient business\noperations, including poor supply chain management, and have a negative impact on customer\n53 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nservice, resulting in a loss of customers, which could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nRentokil Initial may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance\nits protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities, breaches, attacks or\nother similar incidents. Any cybersecurity incident, attack or other similar incident, or its failure to make\nadequate or timely disclosures to the public, regulators, or law enforcement agencies following any such\nevent, could harm Rentokil Initial\u2019s competitive position, result in violations of applicable data privacy or\ncybersecurity laws or regulations, result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of threat\nmitigation and detection processes and procedures, cause disruption to business activities, divert\nmanagement attention and other resources or otherwise adversely affect the internal operations and\nreputation of Rentokil Initial, degrade financial results, cause it to incur significant costs to remedy the\ndamages caused by the incident or defend legal claims, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny and\nexpose Rentokil Initial to civil litigation, fines, damages or injunctions. With respect to cybersecurity-related\nlegal claims and regulatory scrutiny, Rentokil Initial also may incur additional costs related to the diverse set\nof laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject across multiple jurisdictions. See also \u201cRisk Factors\u202f-\u202f\nRisks Related to Rentokil Initial\u2019s Business\u202f-\u202fRentokil Initial is required to comply with stringent, complex\nand evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual\nobligations, relating to data privacy and security. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these\nrequirements could have a material adverse effect on its business.\u201d\nExtraordinary events may significantly impact Rentokil Initial\u2019s business if it is unable to ensure business continuity\ndue to a material incident.\nThe ability to service customers without interruption is essential to Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations.\nContingency plans are required to continue or recover operations following a disruption or incident. Such\nincidents may include (a) the loss or insolvency of a major distributor, (b) repeated or prolonged government\nshutdowns or similar events, (c) war (including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nmarkets), (d) natural or man-made disasters, (e) water shortages, (f) cybersecurity, IT or privacy-related\nincidents or (g) severe weather conditions affecting Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations or the food service,\nhospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business. Inability to\nrestore or replace critical capacity to an agreed level within an agreed time frame would prolong the impact of\nsuch disruption or incident and could lead to, among other things, negative publicity and reputational\ndamage and could severely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and/or prospects.\nRentokil Initial has independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have an adverse effect on\nRentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nGovernment shutdowns can have a material adverse effect on operations or cash flows by disrupting or\ndelaying new product launches, renewals of registrations for existing products and receipt of import or\nexport licenses for raw materials or products.\nWar (including acts of terrorism or hostilities), natural or man-made disasters, water shortages or severe\nweather conditions affecting the food service, hospitality, travel and other industries can cause a downturn\nin the business of Rentokil Initial\u2019s customers, which in turn can have a material adverse effect on Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Hurricanes or other severe weather\nevents impacting the local markets could materially and adversely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s ability to obtain\nraw materials at reasonable cost, or at all, and could adversely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s business. The health\nand safety of Rentokil Initial\u2019s colleagues in local markets could be harmed by the detrimental effects of\nnatural and man-made disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, reputation,\nresults of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nRentokil Initial may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are\nmaterial to its business.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s ability to compete effectively depends in part on its ability to obtain, maintain, protect,\ndefend and enforce its intellectual property and other proprietary rights, including the service marks,\ntrademarks, trade names and other intellectual property rights Rentokil Initial owns or licenses,\n54 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nparticularly its brand names, including Rentokil, Initial, Ambius, Steritech, JC Ehrlich, Presto-X, Western\nExterminator, Florida Pest Control, Eradico, Cannon, Sanitact, Ultraprotect, PestConnect, HygieneConnect,\nEntotherm, Calmic, Turf Fuel, Lumnia, Luminos, SOLitude, Batzner, Medentex, OnBrand360, Peter Cox,\nEnvironmental Pest Service, Pestfree365, Activap, Prokill, Micronclean and Microfresh. Rentokil Initial has\nnot sought to register or protect all of its intellectual property, including its trademarks, either in the UK, U.S.\nor in every jurisdiction in which they are or may be used. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign\ntrademark, patent and other intellectual property laws, Rentokil Initial may not receive the same protection in\nother countries as it would in the UK or the U.S.\nIf Rentokil Initial is unable to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights, including brand\nnames, it could cause a material adverse impact on its business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and/or prospects. Litigation may be necessary to enforce Rentokil Initial\u2019s intellectual property\nrights and protect its proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that its products,\nservices or activities infringe their intellectual property rights.\nRentokil Initial relies on third parties, including third-party vendors for business process outsourcing initiatives,\ninvestment counterparties, and franchisees. Any termination or disruption of such relationships or counterparty\ndefault or litigation could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s strategy to increase profitability, in part, by reducing its costs of operations, and to mitigate\nand manage its exposure to financial risk, includes the implementation of certain business process\noutsourcing initiatives and entry into arrangements with investment counterparties, including lenders,\ninsurers and derivative counterparties. As such, Rentokil Initial is exposed to counterparty risk. Any\ndisruption, termination or substandard performance of these outsourced services, including possible\nbreaches by third-party vendors of their agreements with Rentokil Initial, or the failure of counterparties to\ndischarge all or part of their obligations (including, for example, due to the deterioration of a counterparty\u2019s\nactual or perceived creditworthiness) could adversely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s reputation, customer and\ncolleague relationships, results of operations and financial condition. Also, to the extent a third-party\noutsourcing provider or counterparty relationship is terminated, there is a risk of disputes or litigation and\nthat Rentokil Initial may not be able to enter into a similar agreement with an alternate provider in a timely\nmanner or on terms that Rentokil Initial considers favorable, and even if Rentokil Initial finds an alternate\nprovider, or chooses to insource such services or activities, there are significant risks associated with such\ntransition.\nIn addition, to the extent Rentokil Initial decides to terminate outsourcing services and insource such\nservices, there is a risk that Rentokil Initial may not have the capabilities to perform these services internally,\nresulting in a disruption to Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, which could adversely impact its business, reputation,\nresults of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Rentokil Initial could incur costs, including\npersonnel and equipment costs, to insource previously outsourced services like these, and these costs\ncould adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.\nThird-party distributors, subcontractors, vendors and franchisees are independent third parties that Rentokil\nInitial does not control, and who own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses. If third\nparty distributors, subcontractors, vendors and franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in\na manner consistent with required laws, standards and regulations, Rentokil Initial could be subject to claims\nfrom regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such third-party distributors, subcontractors,\nvendors and franchisees. In addition, Rentokil Initial\u2019s relationship with third-party distributors,\nsubcontractors, vendors and franchisees could become strained (including resulting in litigation) and these\nstrains in relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business,\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business and reputation.\nRentokil Initial is not currently required to comply with the rules of the SEC implementing Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and is therefore not required to\nevaluate the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. However, following its U.S. listing\nand SEC registration, beginning as of the year ended December 31, 2023, Rentokil Initial will be required to\n55 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nevaluate the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and its independent auditor will be\nrequired to audit management's assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial\nreporting.\nWhile Rentokil Initial has yet to design and establish an internal control over financial reporting framework\nfor the purposes of the effectiveness evaluation described above, Rentokil Initial has undertaken a\npreliminary assessment of its controls in connection with the preparation of the registration statement, of\nwhich this prospectus forms a part. In addition, during the preparation of its 2021 financial statements,\nRentokil Initial identified errors to its 2020 and 2019 financial statements which resulted in restatements of\nthose periods. As a result of both the preliminary assessment and the restatements, Rentokil Initial identified\nthe following material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting:\na lack of sufficient resources with the appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge,\nparticularly for non-routine transactions, combined with incomplete policies and procedures related\nto the segregation of duties and control activities required for accurate and timely financial\naccounting, reporting, and disclosures in accordance with the financial reporting requirements set\nforth by the SEC\u037e and\na failure to design and maintain effective IT controls over user access, change management, database\nmanagement and segregation of duties for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of\nits financial statements.\nThough Rentokil Initial has started to design remediation measures in respect of these material weaknesses,\nit has not yet implemented or tested the effectiveness of the remediation measures. Moreover, Rentokil Initial\ncannot be certain that it will not identify other material weaknesses in its internal control over financial\nreporting as it designs, implements and tests its internal control over financial reporting framework in\nanticipation of its initial effectiveness evaluation. Moreover, when Rentokil Initial evaluates the\neffectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting in connection with its annual report for the year\nended December 31, 2023, there can be no guarantee that Rentokil Initial or its independent auditor will not\nidentify other material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.\nIf Rentokil Initial fails to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, it could\nsuffer material misstatements in its consolidated financial statements, fail to meet its reporting obligations or\nfail to prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in its reported financial information and\nsubject Rentokil Initial to potential delisting from the stock exchange, regulatory investigations and civil or\ncriminal sanctions.\nRentokil Initial may be required to recognize impairment charges or be subject to asset revaluations or downgrades.\nRentokil Initial has significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets, such as customer lists. In\naccordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not\namortized and are subject to assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based test annually, or more\nfrequently if there are indicators of impairment, including:\nobservable indications that the asset\u2019s value has declined significantly more than would be expected\nas a result of the passage of time or normal use\u037e\nsignificant changes with an adverse effect on the entity that have taken place, or will take place in the\nnear future, in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the entity operates,\nor in the market to which an asset is dedicated\u037e\nmarket interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have increased, and those\nincreases are likely to affect the discount rate used in calculating an asset\u2019s value in use and decrease\nthe asset\u2019s recoverable amount materially\u037e\nthe carrying amount of the net assets of the entity is more than its market capitalization\u037e\nevidence that there is obsolescence or physical damage of the asset\u037e\nsignificant changes with an adverse effect on the entity that have taken, or are expected to take place\nin the near future, in the extent to which, or manner in which, an asset is used or is expected to be\n56 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nused. These changes include the asset becoming idle, plans to discontinue or restructure the\noperation to which an asset belongs, plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected\ndate, and reassessing the useful life of an asset as finite rather than indefinite\u037e and\nindication that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected.\nBased upon future economic and financial market conditions, the operating performance of Rentokil Initial\nand other factors, including those listed above, Rentokil Initial may incur impairment charges in the future,\nincluding in relation to the transaction in respect of goodwill created and the value at which assets were\nrecognized at completion. It is possible that such impairment, if required, could be material. Any future\nimpairment charges that Rentokil Initial is required to record could have a material adverse impact on its\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Compliance Matters\nGovernment regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nfinancial results.\nAs a global company, Rentokil Initial is subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the\ncountries in which it conducts business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-\nbribery or anti-corruption, consumer protection, product liability, environmental, health and safety,\nintellectual property, data privacy or other matters, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions.\nIf Rentokil Initial is unable to comply with all laws and regulations, it could negatively impact its reputation\nand business results. Rentokil Initial cannot provide assurance that its internal control policies and\nprocedures, and ethics and compliance program will always protect it from acts committed by Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s colleagues or agents. While it is Rentokil Initial\u2019s policy and practice to comply with all legal and\nregulatory requirements applicable to its business, a finding that Rentokil Initial is in violation of, or out of\ncompliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject it to civil remedies, including fines, damages,\ninjunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Even if a claim is\nunsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions\nregarding Rentokil Initial\u2019s products, processes or business practices could adversely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nreputation and brand image.\nIn addition, new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which Rentokil Initial does\nbusiness, which could adversely impact its financial results. For example, new legislation or regulations may\nresult in increased costs to Rentokil Initial, directly for its compliance, or indirectly to the extent suppliers\nincrease prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs, excise taxes or the reduced\navailability of raw materials.\nFollowing completion of the transaction, approximately 60% of the combined company\u2019s total revenues is\nexpected to come from North America and therefore the combined company may face increased exposure to\npotential future claims or litigation given the more litigious nature of the U.S. market, including increased\nexposure to injunctive relief or damages granted by courts in respect of such claims, and regardless of the\noutcome of any litigation or claims, the combined company may incur additional costs in defending against\nsuch claims following completion of the transaction. An unfavorable outcome or settlement in any litigation\nmay have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations financial\ncondition and/or prospects.\nTermite damage claims and lawsuits related thereto could increase Rentokil Initial\u2019s legal expenses and may\nadversely impact its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nFollowing consummation of the transaction, Rentokil Initial\u2019s business may become subject to a significant\nnumber of damage claims related to termite activity in homes/commercial premises, often accompanied by a\ntermite damage warranty/guarantee. Currently Terminix is subject to a significant number of damage claims\nrelated to its termite control services and termite damage warranties/guarantees. Damage claims may include\ncircumstances when a customer notifies Rentokil Initial that they have experienced\n57 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndamage and Rentokil Initial reaches an agreement to remediate that damage (a \u201cNon-litigated Claim\u201d)\u037e and\ncircumstances when a customer directly initiates litigation or arbitration proceedings or when Rentokil Initial\ndoes not reach an agreement with a customer to remediate the damage and that customer initiates litigation\nor arbitration proceedings (a \u201cLitigated Claim\u201d). Some plaintiffs bringing Litigated Claims may seek to\ndemonstrate a pattern and practice of fraud in connection with Litigated Claims and may seek awards, in\naddition to repair costs, which include punitive damages and damages for mental anguish. Rentokil Initial\nintends to defend these Litigated Claims vigorously, and Rentokil Initial intends to take decisive actions to\nmitigate increasing claims costs\u037e however, Rentokil Initial cannot give assurance that these mitigating\nactions will be effective in reducing claims or costs related thereto, nor can it give assurance that lawsuits or\nother proceedings related to termite damage claims will not materially affect its business, reputation, results\nof operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nIn April 2021, the State of Mississippi brought litigation against Terminix related to its termite inspection and\ntreatment practices (the \u201cMississippi Litigation\u201d). Terminix disputes the claims made in the Mississippi\nLitigation and intends to defend the matter vigorously. However, given the uncertainty of litigation, the\npreliminary stage of the case, and the legal standards that must be met for success on the merits, it is not\npossible to predict with certainty the outcome of the Mississippi Litigation. The combined company intends\nto defend the Litigated Claims, including the Mississippi Litigation, vigorously, and intends to take action to\nmitigate increasing claims costs\u037e however, Rentokil Initial cannot give assurance that these mitigating\nactions will be effective in reducing claims or costs related thereto, nor can it give assurance that lawsuits or\nother proceedings related to termite damage claims will not materially affect its business, reputation, results\nof operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nFollowing the completion of the transaction, the combined company\u2019s business may also become subject to\nstate regulator claims related to trade practices, including termite renewal pricing, inspection and treatment\npractices (a \u201cRegulator Claim\u201d). Terminix has been subject to such claims in the past and has entered into\nsettlements, for example with the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Alabama (the \u201cAL AG\u201d) and\nother Alabama state regulators. The combined company intends to defend any Regulator Claims and intends\nto take action to mitigate claims costs\u037e however, Rentokil Initial cannot give assurance that these mitigating\nactions will be effective in reducing claims or costs related thereto, nor can it give assurance that lawsuits or\nother proceedings related to trade practices will not materially affect its business, reputation, results of\noperations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nCompliance with, or violation of, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws pertaining\nto the use of pesticides, could result in significant costs that adversely impact Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation,\nresults of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nThe pest control industry is subject to various laws and regulations regarding environmental and health and\nsafety matters. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the\nenvironment, the use, storage, treatment, disposal, transportation and management of hazardous substances\nand wastes, the impact of chemicals (including fumigant gases), as well as pesticide and biocide products, on\nhuman health and safety and the environment, and the protection of the health and safety of its colleagues\nand the public.\nThese laws also impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from,\npresent and past releases of hazardous substances, including releases by former sites or by prior owners or\noperators of sites Rentokil Initial currently owns or operates. These laws and regulations can result in costs\nassociated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean-up,\nfines, penalties, orders requiring corrective action or suspending or otherwise impacting Rentokil Initial\u2019s\noperations or other sanctions if it is found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or\ndiscontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations.\nChanges in such laws and regulations, including among others, air, water, chemical and product regulations,\ncould impact the sales of some of Rentokil Initial\u2019s products or services. In addition to an increase in costs\nof manufacturing and delivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could\nresult in interruptions to Rentokil Initial\u2019s business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses\nshould it be unable to meet the demands of its customers for products.\n58 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProducts used by Rentokil Initial containing pesticides generally must be registered with the relevant\ngovernmental agencies or authorities before they can be sold or applied. The failure to obtain, or the\ncancellation of, any such registration, or the withdrawal from the marketplace of such pesticides, could have\nan adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, the severity of which would depend on the products\ninvolved, whether other products could be substituted and whether competitors were similarly affected. The\npesticides Rentokil Initial uses are manufactured by independent third parties and are evaluated by the\nrelevant governmental authorities or agencies as part of its ongoing exposure risk assessment. Any of these\nauthorities or agencies may decide that a pesticide Rentokil Initial uses will be limited or will not be re-\nregistered for use in the relevant jurisdiction. Rentokil Initial plc cannot predict the outcome or the severity\nof the effect of any particular authority\u2019s or agency\u2019s continuing evaluations. In addition, the use of certain\npesticide products is regulated by various international, national, federal, state, provincial and local\nenvironmental and public health agencies and bodies. Some of Rentokil Initial\u2019s products may also become\nsubject to bans or restrictions due to animal cruelty concerns. Given Rentokil Initial\u2019s dispersed locations,\ndistributed operations and numerous colleagues and franchise associates, it may be unable to prevent\nviolations of these or other laws and regulations or misuse of products by colleagues or others from\noccurring. Even if Rentokil Initial is able to comply with all such laws and regulations and obtain all\nnecessary registrations and licenses, the pesticides or other products Rentokil Initial applies or uses, or the\nmanner in which it applies or uses them, could be alleged to cause injury to the environment, to people or to\nanimals, or such products could be banned in certain circumstances. The laws and regulations may also\napply to third-party vendors who are hired to repair or remediate property and who may fail to comply with\nenvironmental laws, health and safety laws and regulations and subject Rentokil Initial to risk of legal\nexposure. The costs of compliance, non-compliance, investigation, remediation, combating reputational harm\nor defending civil or criminal proceedings, products liability, personal injury or other lawsuits could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition\nand/or prospects.\nInternational, national, federal, state, provincial and local agencies and bodies regulate the disposal,\nhandling and storage of waste, discharges from Rentokil Initial\u2019s facilities and the investigation and clean-up\nof contaminated sites. Rentokil Initial could incur significant costs, including investigation and clean-up\ncosts, fines, penalties and civil or criminal sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and\npersonal injury, as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, such laws and regulations enforced by these\nagencies and bodies. Liability under laws and regulations can be imposed on a joint and several basis and\nwithout regard to fault or the legality of the underlying conduct. In addition, potentially significant\nexpenditures could be required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations,\nincluding requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nA violation of health and safety or environmental laws or regulations relating to Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations\nor a failure to comply with the instructions of relevant health and safety authorities, environmental agencies\nor internal policies could lead to, among other things, personal injury, negative publicity and reputational\ndamage, fines, costly compliance procedures, litigation and withdrawal of licenses to operate. Such\nviolations could, therefore, have an adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of\noperations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nRentokil Initial is required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in\nmany jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. Any actual or perceived\nfailure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nRentokil Initial is required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and\nstandards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security.\nEnsuring that its collection, use, transfer, storage and other processing of personal information complies\nwith such requirements can increase operating costs, impact the development of new products or services,\nand reduce operational efficiency.\nInternationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which Rentokil Initial operates has established its own data\nprivacy and security legal framework with which it must comply. The cost of compliance, and the potential\nfor fines and penalties for non-compliance, with data privacy and security laws and regulations may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition\nand/or prospects.\n59 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf Rentokil Initial is otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in\nwhich it operates, it could affect the manner in which Rentokil Initial provides its services, the geographical\nlocation or segregation of its relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect its financial\nresults. In addition, such procedures and controls, which Rentokil Initial operates to comply with relevant\ndata privacy and security requirements in the jurisdictions it operates, may not be effective in ensuring\ncompliance or preventing unauthorized transfers of personal data.\nWhile Rentokil Initial strives to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate,\ncomprehensive and compliant with applicable laws, rules, regulations and industry standards, it cannot\nensure that its privacy policies and other statements regarding its practices will be sufficient to protect it\nfrom claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security. Although\nRentokil Initial endeavors to comply with its privacy policies, Rentokil Initial may at times fail to do so or be\nalleged to have failed to do so. If its public statements about its use, collection, disclosure and other\nprocessing of personal information, whether made through its privacy policies, information provided on its\nwebsite, press statements or otherwise, are alleged to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of its actual\npractices, Rentokil Initial may be subject to potential government or legal investigation or action.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s compliance efforts are further complicated by the fact that data privacy and security laws,\nrules, regulations and standards around the world are rapidly evolving, may be subject to uncertain or\ninconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions. Any failure or\nperceived failure by Rentokil Initial to comply with its privacy policies, or applicable data privacy and\nsecurity laws, rules, regulations, standards or contractual obligations, or a security breach that leads to theft\nor other unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure,\nrelease or transfer of personal information, including customer, colleague, supplier or Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nproprietary, sensitive or confidential data, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or\npractices, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against it,\nlegal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties,\nsanctions and costly litigation (including class actions). Any of the foregoing could lead to significant\nreputational damage, distract management and technical personnel, increase its costs of doing business,\nadversely affect the demand for its products and services, and ultimately result in the imposition of liability,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and/or prospects.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could materially and adversely affect the taxes Rentokil\nInitial pays and its profitability.\nRentokil Initial operates across many different tax jurisdictions and is subject to periodic tax audits which\nsometimes challenge the basis on which local tax has been calculated and/or withheld. Successful challenges\nby local tax authorities may have an adverse impact on profitability and cash flow. Unanticipated non-\ncompliance with relevant tax legislation and/or reporting requirements may result in material unprovided tax\ncharges relating to prior years which could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s financial\ncondition and/or prospects.\nThe completion of the transaction will result in Rentokil Initial becoming subject to U.S. regulations which differ\nfrom the regulations to which Rentokil Initial is currently subject. Current and future U.S. regulations could have an\nadverse effect on the results of operations, business and financial position of Rentokil Initial following completion\nof the transaction.\nFollowing the completion of the transaction, as a result of the registration of Rentokil Initial ADSs with the\nSEC, it is expected that Rentokil Initial will be subject to U.S. securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct. These regulations are different from the regulations to which Rentokil Initial is currently subject and\ntherefore pose an increased compliance burden on Rentokil Initial and, particularly where supplemented by\nnew regulations, could lead to higher costs and greater complexity, and potential reputational damage,\nregulatory sanctions or fines in connection with breach. Following the completion of the transaction, the\ncombined company could face increased exposure to other U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations\n(including tax laws), including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, with respect to Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s worldwide activities, as a result of its increased presence in the U.S. The enactment\n60 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof unduly onerous and restrictive regulation may adversely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s share price and could\nhave a material adverse effect on the results of operations, business and/or financial condition of Rentokil\nInitial.\nAs a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d, Rentokil Initial plc would not be required to comply with all of the periodic\ndisclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and governance requirements of the\nNYSE that apply to a U.S. domestic issuer. It is possible that Rentokil Initial could lose foreign private issuer\nstatus in the future. The determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business\nday of an issuer\u2019s second fiscal quarter. As such, Rentokil Initial will re-assess its status as a foreign private\nissuer as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of 2023. Rentokil Initial would lose foreign\nprivate issuer status if more than 50% of its common shares are directly or indirectly held by residents of the\nUnited States and it fails to meet the additional requirements necessary to maintain its foreign private issuer\nstatus. These additional requirements relate to the citizenship and residency of its directors and officers, the\nlocation of its assets and whether its business is principally administered in the United States. If Rentokil\nInitial ceases to be a foreign private issuer, it will be required to comply with reporting, disclosure,\ncompliance and governance requirements that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. This could result in\nsignificant additional legal, accounting and other expenses, as well as increased demands on management\u2019s\ntime.\nRisks Relating to Financing\nAdverse credit and financial market events and conditions could, among other things, impede access to or increase\nthe cost of financing, which could have a material adverse impact on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nDisruptions in credit or financial markets could make it more difficult for Rentokil Initial to obtain, or increase\nits cost of obtaining, financing for its operations or investments or to refinance its indebtedness, or cause\nlenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and not give technical or other waivers under applicable\nagreements governing such indebtedness to the extent Rentokil Initial may seek them in the future, thereby\ncausing it to be in default. There is no assurance that Rentokil Initial will be able to refinance or extend the\nmaturity of its indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to refinance Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nindebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and/or prospects.\nThe agreements and instruments governing Rentokil Initial\u2019s indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that\ncould impact Rentokil Initial\u2019s ability to operate its business.\nAs of June 30, 2022, Rentokil Initial had aggregate outstanding indebtedness of approximately \u00a33.8 billion.\nThe agreement governing Rentokil Initial\u2019s revolving credit facility maturing February 2027, which is\nexpected to increase to US$1 billion at closing (the \u201cRCF\u201d), the Bridge and Term Facilities Agreement and the\nNew Senior Notes contain undertakings that, collectively, among other things, restrict Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nability to: (a) transfer or sell assets by way of a Class 1 transaction (as such term is defined in the FCA\u2019s\nListing Rules)\u037e (b) create security over its assets in excess of a certain amount\u037e (c) issue debt instruments at\nsubsidiary level in excess of a certain amount\u037e and (d) issue trade instruments in excess of a certain amount.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s ability to comply with the undertakings and restrictions contained in each of the agreements\ngoverning the RCF, the Bridge and Term Facilities Agreement, the New Senior Notes and the instruments\ngoverning its other indebtedness may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond its\ncontrol including credit or capital market disruptions. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions\ncould result in a default that would permit the applicable lenders or noteholders to declare all amounts\noutstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. In any such case,\nRentokil Initial may be unable to borrow under the RCF and/or any such other facility and may not be able to\nrepay the amounts due under such facility or its other outstanding indebtedness. This could have materially\nadverse consequences to Rentokil Initial\u2019s (and with effect from completion of the transaction, the combined\ncompany\u2019s) business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects and could cause\nit to become bankrupt or insolvent.\n61 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings, outlook or watch assigned to its debt securities by rating agencies may\nincrease Rentokil Initial\u2019s future borrowing costs and reduce its access to capital.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s indebtedness has primarily investment grade ratings, and any rating, outlook or watch\nassigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment,\ncurrent or future circumstances change relating to the basis of the rating, outlook or watch, such as adverse\nchanges to Rentokil Initial\u2019s business. Any future lowering of its ratings, outlook or watch likely would make\nit more difficult or more expensive for Rentokil Initial to obtain debt financing.\nThe additional indebtedness that Rentokil Initial will incur in connection with the completion of the transaction\ncould adversely affect the combined company\u2019s financial position, including by decreasing Rentokil Initial\u2019s, and\nwith effect from the consummation of the transaction, the combined company\u2019s, business flexibility and result in a\ndecline in the combined company\u2019s credit rating.\nFollowing the consummation of the transaction, the combined company will have increased borrowings\ncompared to Rentokil Initial\u2019s historic level of borrowings. Rentokil Initial\u2019s consolidated borrowings were\napproximately \u00a33.8 billion (US$4.7 billion converted at the \u00a3:$ exchange rate on June 30, 2022) as of June 30,\n2022.\nRentokil Initial may incur up to US$2.7 billion of additional debt in connection with the completion of the\ntransaction, of which approximately US$2 billion (as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus) has been\nincurred. For further information, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\nProposal\u202f-\u202fThe Rentokil Initial Debt Financing\u201d beginning on page 119. This increased level of borrowing\ncould have the effect, among other things, of reducing the combined company\u2019s flexibility to respond to\nchanging business and economic conditions and will have the effect of increasing the combined company\u2019s\ninterest expenses. In addition, the amount of cash required to service the combined company\u2019s increased\nborrowing levels and increased aggregate dividends following consummation of the transaction and thus the\ndemands on the combined company\u2019s cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required\nto service Rentokil Initial\u2019s borrowings and pay dividends prior to the transaction. The increased levels of\nborrowings and any dividends following consummation of the transaction could also reduce funds available\nfor the combined company\u2019s investments in M&A, research and development, capital expenditures and other\nactivities and may create competitive disadvantages for the combined company relative to other companies\nwith lower debt levels.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s credit rating impacts the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly,\nRentokil Initial\u2019s cost of capital. Rentokil Initial\u2019s credit rating reflects each credit rating organization\u2019s\nopinion of Rentokil Initial\u2019s financial and business strength, operating performance and ability to meet its\ndebt obligations. Although Rentokil Initial\u2019s credit rating was reaffirmed by S&P Global Ratings (\u201cS&P\u201d) as\nBBB following the announcement of the transaction, if Rentokil Initial\u2019s (and with effect from the\nconsummation of the transaction, the combined company\u2019s) credit rating declines, Rentokil Initial (and with\neffect from the consummation of the transaction, the combined company) may not be able to sell additional\ndebt securities, borrow money, refinance the transaction facilities (if drawn) or establish alternatives to the\ntransaction facilities in the amounts or at the times or interest rates contemplated thereby (or at all), or upon\nmore favorable terms and conditions that might be available if Rentokil Initial\u2019s current credit rating is\nmaintained.\nThe cost of certain of Rentokil Initial\u2019s existing indebtedness will also increase in the event that Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s credit rating is sub-investment grade. In addition, future borrowings under circumstances in which\nthe combined company\u2019s debt is rated below investment grade may contain further restrictions that impose\nsignificant restrictions on the way the combined company operates following the transaction.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing Rentokil Initial\u2019s debt and could adversely impact\nits business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nFacility B will bear interest at a floating rate. As a result, to the extent Rentokil Initial has not hedged against\nrising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase the cost of\nservicing the debt in the future and could materially and adversely affect Rentokil Initial\u2019s results of\noperations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. In addition, if Rentokil Initial refinances its\nindebtedness and interest rates increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was\nconsummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing debt would\nincrease, which could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and/or prospects.\n62 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b",

A quorum is the\npresence in person (including virtually via the Internet) or by proxy of the holders of record of a majority of\nthe Terminix common stock entitled to vote at the Terminix special meeting. Shares of Terminix common stock\nrepresented at the Terminix special meeting by attendance via the special meeting website or by proxy and\nentitled to vote, but not voted, including shares for which a stockholder directs an \u201cabstention\u201d from voting,\nwill be counted for purposes of determining a quorum. However, because all of the proposals for\nconsideration at the Terminix special meeting are considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters under the NYSE rules (as\ndescribed below), shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be counted as present for the purpose of determining\nthe existence of a quorum unless the stockholder provides their bank, broker or other nominee with voting\ninstructions for at least one of the proposals before the Terminix special meeting. If a quorum is not present\nat the Terminix special meeting or if there are otherwise not sufficient votes at the time of the Terminix special\nmeeting to approve the merger proposal, the chairman of the Terminix special meeting may adjourn the\nmeeting (for additional information, see the section of this proxy statement/\u200bprospectus entitled \u201cThe\nTerminix Special Meeting\u202f-\u202fAdjournments\u201d beginning on page 71).\nUnder the NYSE rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d on behalf of the\nbeneficial owner of such shares have the authority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain\n\u201croutine\u201d proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owners. However,\nbanks, brokers or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters\nthat, under the NYSE rules, as applicable, are \u201cnon-routine.\u201d This can result in a \u201cbroker non-vote,\u201d which\noccurs on an item when (1) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or\nmore \u201croutine\u201d proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other\n\u201cnon-routine\u201d proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (2) the beneficial\nowner fails to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions on a \u201cnon-routine\u201d matter.\nAll of the proposals before the Terminix special meeting are considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters under the\nNYSE rules, and banks, brokers or other nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter\nbefore the meeting. As a result, Terminix does not expect any broker non-votes at the Terminix special\nmeeting, and if you hold your shares of Terminix common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d your shares will not be\nrepresented and will not be voted on any matter unless you affirmatively instruct your bank, broker or other\nnominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker\nor other nominee. It is therefore critical that you cast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or other\nnominee on how to vote.

Any Terminix stockholder who does not make an election will be deemed\nto have made an election to receive the stock consideration.\nThe total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued and the aggregate amount of cash to be paid under\nthe terms of the merger agreement will not vary as a result of individual election preferences. The Rentokil\nInitial ADSs issued in connection with the transaction will be listed on the NYSE and are expected to trade\nunder the symbol \u201cRTO.\u201d Based on the number of shares of Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares outstanding on August 31, 2022, immediately after completion of the transaction, we expect\nthat former Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the transaction would own Rentokil\nInitial ADSs representing approximately 25.7% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial, and\nRentokil Initial shareholders immediately prior to the transaction would own approximately 74.3% of the\noutstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial.\nThe value of the per share cash consideration and the value of the per share stock consideration as of the\nmeasurement day will be substantially the same. For example, as of July 15, 2022 (which date has been\nselected solely for illustrative purposes), Rentokil Initial\u2019s volume weighted share price was \u00a35.0825\n(expressed in whole pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar\nexchange rate was 1.1855. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS price would be\n$30.13 and, accordingly:\nthe per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $42.99 which is (A) $11.00, the\nper share cash amount, plus (B) $31.99, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.13, the\nRentokil Initial ADS price as of such date\u037e and\nthe per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4270 (which\nhave an approximate value as of such date of $42.99) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange ratio, plus (B)\n0.3651, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.13, the Rentokil Initial ADS price as\nof such date.\nAs a result, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the per\nshare stock consideration was approximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common stock. The consideration\nto be paid to Terminix stockholders is subject, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, to automatic\nadjustment and proration in the manner described in the section of this proxy statement/\u200bprospectus entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement  - Merger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 132 to ensure that the total amount of\ncash paid and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs issued in the transaction equal the aggregate amount\nagreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed illustrations of the potential allocation and proration of the\nmerger consideration, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - \nAllocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page 135.\n74 \u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe market value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders will fluctuate with the market price of\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares and will not be known at the time that Terminix stockholders vote on the\ntransaction. Based on Rentokil Initial\u2019s five-day average daily volume weighted share price and the five-day\naverage of the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in each case, over the period spanning December 6, 2021 to\nDecember 10, 2021, inclusive, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders was\napproximately $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock. As described in the prior paragraph, based on\nRentokil Initial\u2019s volume weighted average share price and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in\neach case, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders was\napproximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common stock. To further demonstrate how the implied value of\nthe merger consideration may fluctuate over time, we note that as of August 31, 2022 (the latest practicable\ndate prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus), Rentokil Initial\u2019s volume weighted share price was\n\u00a35.2331 (expressed in whole pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-U.S.\nDollar exchange rate was 1.1638. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS price would\nbe $30.45 and, accordingly:\nthe per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $43.33 which is (A) $11.00, the\nper share cash amount, plus (B) $32.33, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.45, the\nRentokil Initial ADS price as of such date\u037e and\nthe per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4231 (which\nhave an approximate value as of such date of $43.33) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange ratio, plus (B)\n0.3612, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.45, the Rentokil Initial ADS price as\nof such date.\nAs a result, as of August 31, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the per\nshare stock consideration was approximately $43.33 per share of Terminix common stock. The consideration\nto be paid to Terminix stockholders is subject, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, to automatic\nadjustment and proration in the manner described in the section of this proxy statement/\u200bprospectus entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 132 to ensure that the total amount of\ncash paid and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs issued in the transaction equal the aggregate amount\nagreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed illustrations of the potential allocation and proration of the\nmerger consideration, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202f\nAllocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page 135.\nThe market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the implied value of the merger consideration, could\nbe greater than, less than or the same as their market price or implied value, as applicable, on the date of this\nproxy statement/prospectus or the date of the Terminix special meeting. Accordingly, you should obtain\ncurrent market quotations for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock before deciding\nhow to vote with respect to the merger proposal. Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock\nare traded on the LSE and the NYSE, under the symbols \u201cRTO\u201d and \u201cTMX,\u201d respectively. The price of\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares is reported in pounds sterling.\nProration of the Merger Consideration\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, if the stock consideration is oversubscribed, then each\nTerminix stockholder that either elected the stock consideration or failed to make a valid cash/stock election\nwill receive a prorated number of Rentokil Initial ADSs and an amount in cash in U.S. dollars (without\ninterest). Such cash amount will be equivalent to the value of the amount of stock consideration payable in\nexcess of the prorated number of Rentokil Initial ADSs, with such stock consideration valued based on the\nvolume weighted average price (in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil Initial ADSs (measured based on the volume\nweighted average price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares multiplied by the number of Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares underlying each Rentokil Initial ADS) for the measurement day.\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, if the cash consideration is oversubscribed, then each\nTerminix stockholder that elected the cash consideration will receive a prorated amount in cash (without\ninterest) in U.S. dollars (the \u201cprorated cash amount\u201d) and a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs with a value\nequivalent to the amount of cash consideration owed in excess of the prorated cash amount. Such Rentokil\n75 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nInitial ADSs will be valued based on the volume weighted average price (in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil Initial\nADSs (measured using the volume weighted average price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares multiplied by\nthe number of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by each Rentokil Initial ADS) for the measurement\nday.\nThe calculation of the prorated merger consideration in the event of oversubscription of either the stock\nconsideration or merger consideration is further discussed in the section of this proxy statement/\u200bprospectus\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d beginning on page 132. For detailed illustrations\nof the potential allocation and proration of the merger consideration, see the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fAllocation of Merger Consideration and\nIllustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page 135.\nCash/Stock Election\nAt least 20 business days prior to the anticipated closing date, the form of election will be mailed to all\nrecord holders of Terminix common stock as of September 6, 2022. The form of election will allow each\nTerminix stockholder to specify the number of shares of Terminix common stock with respect to which such\nholder elects to make a cash election or a stock election. The election must be made prior to the election\ndeadline. The election deadline will be 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is three business days\nbefore the closing date. In connection with the anticipated completion of the transaction, the anticipated\nelection deadline for Terminix stockholders to elect the form of merger consideration they desire to receive in\nthe transaction has been set for 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 6, 2022. If the closing date is delayed to a\nsubsequent date, the election deadline will be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Rentokil Initial and\nTerminix will promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled election deadline.\nTo make a valid election, each record holder of Terminix common stock must submit a properly completed\nform of election so that it is actually received by the exchange agent at its designated office at or prior to the\nelection deadline. A form of election must be properly completed and signed and accompanied by any\nadditional documents required by the procedures set forth in the form of election. After a valid election as\ndescribed in this paragraph has been made with respect to shares of Terminix common stock, no further\nregistration of transfers of such shares can be made on the stock transfer books of Terminix, unless and until\nsuch election is properly revoked as described below.\nImpact of Selling Terminix Common Stock as to Which a Cash/Stock Election Has Already Been Made\nTerminix stockholders of record who have made a cash/stock election will be unable to sell or otherwise\ntransfer their shares of Terminix common stock after making such election, unless the cash/stock election is\nproperly revoked before such election deadline in accordance with the election procedures or unless the\nmerger agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms.\nCash/Stock Election Revocation\nAny record holder of Terminix common stock who has delivered a duly completed election form to the\nexchange agent may, at any time prior to the election deadline, revoke such stockholder\u2019s cash/stock election\nby written notice received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline. Terminix stockholders will\nnot be entitled to revoke their cash/stock election following the election deadline, unless the merger\nagreement is thereafter terminated. As a result, Terminix stockholders who have made a cash/stock election\nwill be unable to revoke such election or sell their shares of Terminix common stock during the period\nbetween the election deadline and the date of completion of the transaction or termination of the merger\nagreement.\nNon-Electing Holders\nTerminix stockholders who do not make a cash/stock election, whose election forms are not received by the\nexchange agent by the election deadline, or whose cash/stock election was not otherwise properly made in\nthe determination of the exchange agent (or in the reasonable determination of Rentokil Initial, if the\nexchange agent declines to make such determination), in each case, are deemed to have elected to receive the\nstock consideration with respect to such holder\u2019s shares of Terminix common stock.\n76",

        "Background of the Transaction": {
            "text": "Background of the Transaction\nAs part of Terminix\u2019s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the\nTerminix board of directors and senior management periodically review, consider and assess Terminix\u2019s\noperations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those\nstrategic goals and plans. These reviews have included, among other matters, the consideration of potential\nopportunities for business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures and other financial and strategic\nalternatives. Management also prepares a five-year strategy plan in the ordinary course (the \u201cTerminix\nstrategy plan\u201d) to facilitate these reviews, which is periodically updated and reviewed with the Terminix\nboard of directors, that reflects management\u2019s financial and business outlook for Terminix over a five-year\nperiod.\nIn February and March of 2018, with the authorization of the Terminix board of directors and the assistance\nof Terminix\u2019s financial advisors, including Lazard, and its outside counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz\n(\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d), representatives of Terminix reached out to and met with representatives of Rentokil\nInitial on two separate occasions to discuss the possibility of a merger transaction between the parties, to be\nfollowed by a spin-off of the American Home Shield business to shareholders of both Terminix and Rentokil\nInitial. Preliminary discussions followed. On May 4, 2018, Terminix and Rentokil Initial entered into a mutual\nnondisclosure agreement containing customary standstill restrictions on both parties (which restrictions\nwould terminate in the event the other party entered into a definitive agreement for a merger with a third\nparty). These discussions terminated in June 2018 due to the fact that the parties could not reach a\npreliminary agreement on the basic terms of a transaction, including with respect to structure and valuation.\nAdditionally, at that time, Terminix had substantially progressed the spin-off of its American Home Shield\nbusiness, as an alternative value-creating transaction for Terminix stockholders. As a result, the parties did\nnot exchange substantial due diligence information or otherwise advance negotiations on the financial,\nstructural or other material terms and conditions of a transaction at that time, and Terminix decided to\nproceed with its previously announced spin-off of its American Home Shield business instead of further\nexploring a potential transaction with Rentokil Initial. Terminix and Rentokil Initial had no further discussions\nregarding a strategic combination of the two companies until October 2021. Prior to 2018, there were no\npreexisting business relationships or substantive discussions between the two companies relating to any\npotential transaction.\nOn October 1, 2018, Terminix completed the spin-off of its American Home Shield business. Thereafter, on\nOctober 1, 2020, Terminix completed the sale of its ServiceMaster Brands businesses to an affiliate of\ninvestment funds managed by Roark Capital Management LLC. These transactions enabled Terminix\u2019s\ntransition to a singularly focused pest management company, rather than a diversified services provider, and\nsubsequently Rentokil Initial expressed renewed interest in a combination in October 2021.\nOn October 1, 2021, Andy Ransom, Rentokil Initial\u2019s Chief Executive, separately contacted Naren K.\nGursahaney, Chairman of the Terminix board of directors, and on October 4, 2021, Brett T. Ponton, Terminix\u2019s\nChief Executive Officer, to inquire as to whether Terminix would be amenable to discussing a potential\nstrategic combination with Rentokil Initial. Mr. Ransom indicated that Rentokil Initial could be in a position\nto submit a formal proposal for a transaction in the coming weeks. The members of the Terminix board of\ndirectors were subsequently notified of the inquiry, and Terminix management contacted representatives of\nLazard and Wachtell Lipton to discuss next steps.\nOn October 5, 2021, Messrs. Ransom and Ponton continued their discussion of a potential strategic\ncombination of Terminix and Rentokil Initial. Later, on October 10, 2021, Mr. Ransom shared with Mr. Ponton\na presentation providing an overview on Rentokil Initial, its business and other publicly available\nbackground information.\nOn October 11, 2021, the Terminix board of directors convened a meeting, together with members of\nmanagement and representatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton\nprovided an overview of the Terminix board of directors\u2019 duties with respect to the approach from Rentokil\n77 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nInitial, and representatives of Lazard reviewed preliminary financial analyses regarding Terminix based on,\namong other factors, unaudited prospective Terminix financial information provided to Lazard on October 7,\n2021 that Terminix management had prepared in the ordinary course as part of the Terminix strategy plan and\nthat had been reviewed by the Terminix board of directors on September 1, 2021 (the \u201cSeptember 2021\nTerminix management unaudited Terminix projections\u201d), and preliminary financial analyses regarding Rentokil\nInitial. For more information regarding the September 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix\nprojections, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Proposal\u202f-\u202fCertain\nTerminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,\u201d beginning on page 100, and the table summarizing\nthe September 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections beginning on page 103. The\nTerminix board of directors discussed a range of potential responses to Mr. Ransom\u2019s inquiry, and instructed\nMr. Ponton to contact Mr. Ransom to express Terminix\u2019s willingness to consider a proposal for a transaction\nfrom Rentokil Initial if it valued Terminix appropriately and provided an acceptable level of certainty of\ncompletion. Mr. Ponton communicated the Terminix board\u2019s message to Mr. Ransom, who stated his\nexpectation that Rentokil Initial would submit a formal proposal in the coming weeks.\nOn October 13, 2021, Mr. Ponton, Robert Riesbeck, Terminix\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, and Dion Persson,\nSenior Vice President, Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions of Terminix, had a call with Mr. Ransom, Stuart\nIngall-Tombs, Rentokil Initial\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, and Chris Hunt, Rentokil Initial\u2019s Group M&A\nDirector, to convey their interest in a potential transaction at an appropriate valuation and to discuss\nRentokil Initial\u2019s view of the strategic benefits of a combination of the two companies\u2019 businesses, which\nbenefits included Rentokil Initial\u2019s views that a transaction would have compelling industrial logic as the\ncombined company would have a complementary residential and commercial pest services business and a\nleading global footprint with strong route-density and a large customer base, and Rentokil Initial\u2019s views that\na transaction would be highly synergistic, including with respect to operating costs, technology, corporate\nand administrative matters, and procurement. Later, on October 13, 2021, Mr. Ransom shared with Mr. Ponton\na presentation summarizing Rentokil Initial\u2019s view of such strategic benefits.\nOn October 14, 2021, the Terminix board of directors met with members of management and representatives of\nLazard and Wachtell Lipton. An update was provided regarding Mr. Ponton\u2019s conversation with Mr. Ransom.\nRepresentatives of Lazard then reviewed with the board a list of potential counterparties that could be\ninterested in pursuing a strategic transaction with Terminix, including an industry participant (\u201cParty A\u201d) and\ntwo private equity firms (\u201cParty B\u201d and \u201cParty C\u201d). The Terminix board of directors discussed various\nconsiderations associated with reaching out to, and pursuing a transaction with, these parties, in addition to\ncontinuing discussions with Rentokil Initial regarding a potential transaction.\nOn October 21, 2021, the Terminix board of directors, together with members of management and\nrepresentatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton, held a meeting to further discuss the possibility of engaging\nwith Rentokil Initial and other third parties regarding a potential transaction. Representatives of Lazard\nshared their preliminary perspectives on valuation and the financial aspects of a transaction with Rentokil\nInitial based on, among other factors, an assumed amount of $175 million of annual pre-tax cost synergies\n(sensitivity cases were included if estimated pre-tax cost synergies were increased or decreased by $25\nmillion) and updated unaudited prospective Terminix financial information provided to Lazard on October 19,\n2021 that Terminix management had prepared to reflect, among other factors, Terminix\u2019s actual financial\nresults for the period from July 1, 2021 through August 31, 2021 (the \u201cOctober 2021 Terminix management\nunaudited Terminix projections\u201d). For more information regarding the October 2021 Terminix management\nunaudited Terminix projections, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\nProposal\u202f-\u202fCertain Terminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 100, and the\ntable summarizing the October 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections beginning on page\n103.\nRepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton also discussed regulatory and other legal considerations pertinent to a\npotential strategic combination. The Terminix board of directors considered these perspectives along with\nthe opportunities and risks associated with continuing to operate Terminix on a stand-alone basis and other\nstrategic alternatives. The Terminix board of directors also considered the possibility of contacting other\nparties to ascertain their potential interest in a transaction with Terminix. These parties included Party\n78 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA, Party B and Party C, who, in the judgment of management and Lazard (after considering the landscape of\npotential financial and strategic parties, the likelihood of such parties\u2019 interest in a potential transaction and\nthe industry in which Terminix operates), were the most likely parties, other than Rentokil Initial, who could\nreasonably be expected to be interested in pursuing a transaction with Terminix, would not face significant\nexecution risk in consummating a transaction of scale and in the industry in which Terminix operates, had\nsufficient expertise in the services industry such that a combination would make financial and strategic sense\nfor both parties, and would not introduce significant leak risk. The Terminix board of directors then\ninstructed management and representatives of Lazard to contact Party A, Party B and Party C to ascertain\ntheir potential interest in a transaction, while continuing to engage in discussions with representatives of\nRentokil Initial. In light of the aforementioned considerations and the execution and leak risks associated\nwith a broader outreach effort, the Terminix board of directors determined not to contact other parties at the\ntime.\nShortly following the meeting, representatives of Lazard contacted representatives of Party A, Party B and\nParty C to inquire as to their potential interest in a strategic transaction with Terminix. Representatives of\nParty A and Party C expressed preliminary interest in a potential transaction, while Party B\u2019s representatives\nindicated shortly afterwards that they did not believe that Party B could make a proposal that would be\ncompetitive on valuation and thus would not be interested in further exploring a transaction.\nOn October 29, 2021, Messrs. Ponton and Persson met with Mr. Ransom to discuss a potential transaction\nbetween Terminix and Rentokil Initial. Mr. Ransom orally conveyed the terms of a proposal by Rentokil Initial\nto acquire Terminix, a written copy of which was delivered to Messrs. Ponton and Persson after the\nconclusion of the meeting. The proposal contemplated an implied purchase price of $54.00 per share of\nTerminix common stock consisting of approximately 80% stock and 20% cash. The proposal also\ncontemplated that Terminix stockholders could elect to receive all cash or all stock merger consideration,\nsubject to proration in the event of oversubscription, and that the consummation of a transaction would not\nbe subject to any financing contingency. In addition, Mr. Ransom raised the possibility that a member of the\nTerminix board of directors would be appointed to Rentokil Initial\u2019s board of directors upon the closing of a\ntransaction. On the same day, Terminix and Party C entered into a nondisclosure agreement containing\ncustomary standstill restrictions on Party C (which restrictions would terminate in the event Terminix entered\ninto a definitive agreement for a merger with a third party).\nOn November 2, 2021, representatives of Party A contacted Lazard to indicate that, after further\nconsideration of Party A\u2019s strategic priorities and concerns over its ability to integrate the Terminix business\nin light of those priorities, Party A was not interested in further exploring a potential strategic transaction\nwith Terminix. Shortly thereafter, the Terminix board of directors met with members of management and\nrepresentatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton. The Lazard representatives provided an overview of the terms\nof Rentokil Initial\u2019s proposal as well as an update on the status of Terminix\u2019s outreach efforts to Party A,\nParty B and Party C. The Terminix board of directors then instructed management and Lazard to communicate\nto Rentokil Initial that the board appreciated the seriousness of Rentokil Initial\u2019s proposal but was keenly\nfocused on deal certainty, upfront price and overall value creation for Terminix stockholders, and that\nTerminix would be willing to share certain due diligence materials, subject to the execution of a mutually\nacceptable confidentiality agreement, to enable Rentokil Initial to refine its assessment of the potential value\nof a combination. Mr. Ponton subsequently contacted Mr. Ransom to convey the board\u2019s message. The\nTerminix board of directors also authorized management to continue outreach efforts with Party C.\nOn November 5, 2021, Terminix and Rentokil Initial entered into a mutual nondisclosure agreement\nsuperseding (and which was substantially similar to) the nondisclosure agreement previously agreed to by\nthe parties on May 4, 2018. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Rentokil Initial began submitting due\ndiligence requests and, on November 9, 2021, the Terminix board of directors held a meeting at which\nrepresentatives of Lazard reported on the process for addressing these requests. In the following weeks\nthrough December 8, 2021, and with the authorization of the Terminix board of directors, representatives of\nTerminix provided Rentokil Initial with access to a virtual data room, hosted diligence sessions for the benefit\nof Rentokil Initial and responded to numerous diligence requests and questions. Representatives of Rentokil\nInitial also provided Terminix with access to a virtual data room containing various due diligence materials\nand hosted due diligence sessions with representatives of Lazard and members of Terminix\n79 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmanagement, including a discussion between representatives of Lazard and Rentokil Initial\u2019s financial\nadvisers, Barclays and Goldman Sachs International, regarding Wall Street research analyst financial\nforecasts and consensus estimates relating to Rentokil Initial.\nOn November 10, 2021, Mr. Ponton along with other members of Terminix management hosted a management\npresentation for the benefit of Party C at which they reviewed Terminix\u2019s corporate strategy and business\nand financial performance and addressed questions from representatives of Party C. Representatives of\nTerminix also made due diligence materials available to representatives of Party C.\nOn November 16, 2021, the Terminix board of directors met to discuss the status of Terminix\u2019s ongoing due\ndiligence discussions and workstreams, as well as an illustrative timetable for negotiating transaction\ndocuments and announcing a transaction.\nOn November 18, 2021, representatives of Party C contacted Lazard to express that Party C was no longer\ninterested in pursuing a potential transaction with Terminix in light of concerns over execution risk and its\nability to make a proposal that would be competitive on valuation.\nOn November 19, 2021, representatives of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP (\u201cDavis Polk\u201d), Rentokil Initial\u2019s legal\ncounsel, circulated a draft merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. The draft reflected the\ntransaction and purchase price structure contemplated by Rentokil Initial\u2019s October 29th proposal and\nincluded, among other terms, a \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provision that would permit the board of directors of either\nparty to change its recommendation in the event such party received an alternative acquisition proposal from\na third party under certain circumstances, but without providing a right of either party to terminate the\nagreement to enter into an alternative acquisition proposal, and also provided for an unspecified termination\nfee amount payable by each party in the event of a change of recommendation or, in the case of Terminix, if\nTerminix entered into a definitive agreement with a third party within 12 months following the termination of\nthe agreement in certain circumstances. The draft merger agreement also contemplated that one member of\nthe Terminix board of directors (to be designated by Rentokil Initial) would be appointed to Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nboard of directors upon the closing of a transaction. The draft agreement noted that the terms of the parties\u2019\nrespective obligations to obtain any regulatory approvals required for the consummation of a transaction\nwould be determined at a later time following further analysis and discussion.\nOn November 23, 2021, the Terminix board of directors convened a meeting, together with members of\nmanagement and representatives from Lazard and Wachtell Lipton. Management and representatives of\nLazard provided an update regarding the status of Terminix\u2019s ongoing discussions with Rentokil Initial and\noutreach efforts to Party C. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Terminix board of directors\nthe terms of the draft merger agreement provided by Davis Polk. The Terminix board of directors discussed,\namong other things, the regulatory processes associated with a strategic combination and the merger\nagreement\u2019s provisions addressing deal certainty. The Terminix board of directors was of the view that, while\nRentokil Initial\u2019s proposal was attractive from a financial perspective, management should seek to further\nimprove the financial and other terms of the transaction. After consideration of the feedback from Party A,\nParty B and Party C and the aforementioned execution and leak risks associated with a broader outreach\neffort, the Terminix board of directors decided not to contact any other parties with respect to a transaction\nand directed management, in consultation with Lazard and Wachtell Lipton, to continue discussions with\nRentokil Initial to determine if the parties could reach agreement on mutually acceptable terms.\nThrough the subsequent two weeks, members of management and representatives of Lazard and Wachtell\nLipton participated in multiple telephonic and in-person discussions with their respective counterparts at\nRentokil Initial and its legal and financial advisors regarding the open financial and legal points between the\nparties. In addition, further revised drafts of the merger agreement were exchanged between Wachtell Lipton\nand Davis Polk, which reflected a number of changes to the terms proposed in the draft merger agreement\ncirculated by Davis Polk on November 19, 2021, including the addition of a right by Terminix to terminate the\nmerger agreement in the event it received an alternative acquisition proposal from a third party under certain\ncircumstances. The parties also discussed the regulatory processes associated with a strategic combination\nand the merger agreement provisions addressing deal certainty. Members of Terminix management, directly\nand through representatives of Wachtell Lipton, proposed to Rentokil Initial a \u201chell or high water\u201d framework\nunder which the parties would be required to take any and all actions\n80 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnecessary to obtain any regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction, including any\ndivestitures of businesses, assets, properties or product lines of Terminix or Rentokil Initial. Representatives\nof Rentokil Initial conveyed that Rentokil Initial was not prepared to agree to such an uncapped obligation.\nOn December 2, 2021, the Terminix board of directors met with members of management and representatives\nfrom Lazard and Wachtell Lipton to discuss the status of negotiations with Rentokil Initial. Management\ndiscussed the possibility of reaching out to Rentokil Initial to request that it increase its contemplated\nimplied purchase price (in light of the increase in the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the\ndecrease in the market price of Terminix common stock that had taken place since Rentokil Initial\u2019s October\n29th proposal) and accept certain enhanced obligations to obtain any regulatory clearance required to effect\n29th proposal) and accept certain enhanced obligations to obtain any regulatory clearance required to effect\nthe consummation of a transaction. The Terminix board of directors considered these perspectives and\ndirected management, together with Lazard and Wachtell Lipton, to seek the enhancements discussed by\nmanagement. Thereafter, members of management and representatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton\nengaged in further discussions with representatives of Rentokil Initial and its legal and financial advisors.\nAs an outcome of these discussions, representatives of Rentokil Initial agreed to increase the implied\npurchase price to $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock (consisting of approximately 80% stock and\n20% cash based on the price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares at announcement) and to pay a termination\nfee to Terminix in the event a governmental authority entered an order relating to antitrust laws prohibiting\nthe transaction or the parties failed to obtain required regulatory approvals under certain circumstances. The\nonly implied purchase prices formally offered by Rentokil Initial and reviewed by the Terminix board of\ndirectors were the implied purchase price of $54.00 per share in its proposal of October 29, 2021 and\nthereafter the implied purchase price of $55.00 per share in its proposal of December 2, 2021. The increase\ncame after discussions between the parties regarding several factors, including, among other things,\nnegotiation of the regulatory efforts covenant in the merger agreement and the fact that $54.00 per share was\nless than Terminix\u2019s 52-week trading high of $55.00. After several rounds of discussions, Rentokil Initial\nrepresentatives agreed to divestitures of businesses, assets, properties or product lines so long as they did\nnot, in the aggregate, generate total revenues in excess of 12.8% of Terminix\u2019s total revenues in the calendar\nyear 2020.\nA regular meeting of the Terminix board of directors was held on December 6, 2021, at which members of\nmanagement and representatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton updated the board as to their recent\ndiscussions with representatives of Rentokil Initial. The Terminix board of directors discussed, among other\nthings, the limitations proposed by Rentokil Initial on its obligation to undertake divestitures or other\nremedies required to obtain regulatory clearance, and after consideration of the potential implications for\ndeal certainty as well as other potential risks and benefits of the transaction, the Terminix board of directors\ndetermined to accept Rentokil Initial\u2019s proposed limitation and directed management and Terminix\u2019s advisors\nto work with their counterparts at Rentokil Initial towards finalizing the terms of a transaction, with the goal\nof announcing a signed merger agreement on December 14, 2021.\nOver the next several days, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Davis Polk exchanged further revised\ndrafts of the merger agreement to reflect these and other changes. On December 10, 2021, the Terminix board\nof directors met with members of management and representatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton to review\nthe terms of the proposed merger agreement and to further discuss the potential risks and opportunities\npresented by the potential transaction. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed the fiduciary duties of\nthe Terminix board of directors, and representatives of Lazard presented their financial analyses in respect of\nTerminix and Rentokil Initial and the financial aspects of a transaction based on, among other factors, further\nupdated unaudited prospective Terminix financial information provided to Lazard on December 7, 2021 that\nTerminix management had prepared to reflect, among other factors, Terminix\u2019s actual financial results for the\nperiod from September 1, 2021 through October 31, 2021 (the \u201cDecember 2021 Terminix management\nunaudited Terminix projections\u201d).

In this regard, the Terminix board of directors considered:\nthat, in an effort to determine its respective interest in engaging in a strategic transaction with\nTerminix, and at the direction of the Terminix board of directors, Lazard contacted an industry\nparticipant and two private equity firms that, in the judgment of management and Lazard, were\nthe most likely parties, other than Rentokil Initial, who could reasonably be expected to be\ninterested in pursuing a transaction with Terminix and would not face significant execution risk in\nconsummating a transaction while also not otherwise introducing significant leak risk, and\nTerminix thereafter provided diligence information to one of these parties, but ultimately none of\nthese parties determined to pursue a potential transaction with Terminix\u037e\nits belief, based on positions taken by Rentokil Initial during negotiations and the significant\npremium relative to the stand-alone price of Terminix\u2019s common stock, that the merger\nconsideration was the maximum consideration that Rentokil Initial would be willing to offer\u037e\nits belief that entering into the merger agreement with Rentokil Initial provided the best\nalternative for maximizing stockholder value reasonably available to Terminix and its\nstockholders, including when compared to continuing to operate on a stand-alone basis and\ntaking into account certain risks associated with continuing to operate as a stand-alone\ncompany, including industry competition, challenges achieving growth objectives, ongoing labor\nshortages, and other risk factors set forth in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Terminix\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which is incorporated\nby reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, and other documents that are incorporated by\nreference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

            "text": "Rentokil Initial\u2019s Reasons for the Transaction\nThe Rentokil Initial board of directors carefully evaluated the merger agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby and unanimously approved the terms of, and the transactions contemplated by, the\nmerger agreement and unanimously resolved that the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby (including the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals) be submitted for approval\nby the Rentokil Initial shareholders.\nIn the course of reaching its decision, the Rentokil Initial board of directors consulted with Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nmanagement and its financial and legal advisors and considered a number of factors, including the following\nfactors that weighed in favor of the transaction (not necessarily in order of relative importance):\nIncreased scale and leadership in the global pest control market. The combined company will\nbecome the leading global pest control company, with a customer base of approximately 4.9 million\ncustomers and approximately 56,000 colleagues globally. The transaction will deliver a significantly\nenhanced network and improved route density, bringing the combined company closer to its\ncustomers, with its colleagues able to spend more time directly with customers and less time driving\nto and from customer visits.\nSubstantially increased scale in North America, providing an enlarged platform for profitable\ngrowth. The combined company will become the leading player in North America, the world\u2019s largest\npest control market (representing approximately 51% of the global market and estimated to be worth\napproximately US$11 billion). As such, North America is of significant strategic importance and focus\nfor Rentokil Initial. It is a highly competitive and fragmented market comprising over 20,000 pest\ncontrol companies. Commercial pest control comprises the largest segment in North America at\napproximately 45% of the market, with residential comprising approximately 35% and termites at\napproximately 20%. Rentokil Initial is currently a leading brand in commercial pest control, while\nTerminix is the most recognized brand for termite and residential pest control in the United States,\nundertaking approximately 50,000 customer visits each day from 380 locations across 45 states.\nTerminix generated pest control revenues of approximately US$2 billion for the year ended December\n31, 2021. The combined company will become the leading global pest control company, which will\ninclude a leading brand for residential and termite pest control in North America, as well as the\nleading global brand in commercial pest control. Upon the completion of the transaction,\napproximately 60% of the combined company\u2019s total revenues is expected to come from North\nAmerica. The combined company will create additional scale, which will enable further investments in\npeople, service quality, innovation, digital technology and applications and sustainability, to meet the\nfuture needs of customers and colleagues. Following the completion of the transaction, the combined\ncompany intends to open a new science and innovation center in the United States focused on\ntermite and residential pest control.\nA complementary and synergistic combination. Rentokil Initial and Terminix have complementary\nservice lines (combining Rentokil Initial\u2019s expertise in commercial pest control globally with Terminix\u2019s\nexpertise in residential and termite pest control in North America). Rentokil Initial and Terminix\u2019s\ngeographic footprints in North America are also complementary, allowing greater route density to be\n87 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nachieved, and presenting further opportunities to enhance operational efficiency. Both Rentokil Initial\nand Terminix have similar operating models which will enable the effective sharing of best practices in\nthe future. In addition, Rentokil Initial is a leader in innovation and digital technology, creating\nservices and products which can be rolled out to Terminix\u2019s approximately 2.9 million pest control\ncustomers. The combined company is expected to generate material annual pre-tax cost synergies of\nat least US$150 million (\u00a3113 million, assuming the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate as of December\n10, 2021) by the third full year following the completion of the transaction, owing to greater footprint\ndensity, procurement leverage, property rationalization, duplicate administrative and overhead\nrationalization, marketing, sales effectiveness, head office synergies and financing. Both Rentokil\nInitial and Terminix have a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and are committed to\ncreating a high-quality working environment with attractive opportunities for colleagues from both\nbusinesses to develop rewarding long-term careers in the combined company. It is expected that the\ncombined company will be able to further differentiate itself from its competitors through its strong\nfocus on people, customers and delivering products and services responsibly, and benefiting society\nand the environment by acting in a responsible manner.\nAn attractive financial profile.\nThe combined company will have an attractive financial profile, with the opportunity to increase\nthe combined company\u2019s net operating margins through cost reductions and operational\nefficiencies by approximately one percent in each of the three full calendar years following the\ncompletion of the transaction. A strong balance sheet will support growth through continued\ninvestments in people, innovation, digital technologies and sustainability, and through further\nM&A opportunities around the world.\nThe transaction will create a larger, highly diversified and more resilient business in the markets\nof pest control and hygiene and wellbeing. In the North America pest control market, the\ncombined company\u2019s business will be well balanced between residential and termite (expected to\nbe approximately 60% of revenues) and commercial (expected to be approximately 40% of\nrevenues) pest services. As of the end of Terminix\u2019s fiscal year 2021, revenue from termite control\nis approximately 45% of Terminix\u2019s residential revenues, and will become approximately 20% of\nthe combined company\u2019s North America pest business upon the completion of the transaction.\nThe combined company will also have a strong, complementary international hygiene and\nwellbeing business, with leading positions in 22 of its 65 markets. Revenues from Hygiene &\nWellbeing are expected to form approximately 21% of total combined company revenues and the\nsegment is expected to deliver 4% to 6% organic growth each year over the medium term from\n2022.\nThe Rentokil Initial board of directors also considered a variety of uncertainties, risks and other potentially\nnegative factors concerning the merger agreement and the transaction in connection with its deliberations,\nincluding:\nThe difficulties and challenges inherent in completing the proposed transaction and integrating the\nbusinesses, operations and workforce of Terminix with those of Rentokil Initial and the potential risk\nthat some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction may fail to materialize, or may not occur\nwithin the time periods anticipated\u037e\nThe potential risk of diverting management and colleague attention and resources from the operation\nof Rentokil Initial\u2019s business and towards the completion of the transaction\u037e\nThe risk that certain key employees of Terminix may not choose to remain with the combined company\nfollowing the closing\u037e\nThat Rentokil Initial would be required to pay to Terminix a termination fee of $150 million in the event\nthe merger agreement were to be terminated in certain circumstances if the Rentokil Initial board of\ndirectors were to change its recommendation\u037e\nThe ability of the Terminix board of directors, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the merger\nagreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal\u037e\n88",

With respect to the financial\nforecasts utilized in Lazard\u2019s analyses, including those related to projected synergies and other benefits\nanticipated by the management of Terminix to be realized from the transaction, Lazard assumed, with the\nconsent of Terminix, that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of Terminix and Rentokil Initial, respectively,\nand to such synergies and other benefits. Lazard assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to\nany such forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based, including with respect to the potential\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic on such forecasts or assumptions.\nFurther, Lazard\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in\neffect on, and the information made available to Lazard as of, the date of its opinion. Lazard assumed no\nresponsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date\nof its opinion. Lazard further noted that volatility and disruption in the credit and financial markets\n90 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrelating to, among others, the COVID-19 pandemic, may or may not have an effect on Terminix and Rentokil\nInitial and Lazard did not express any opinion as to the effects of such volatility or such disruption on\nTerminix or Rentokil Initial. Lazard did not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Terminix\ncommon stock, Rentokil Initial ADSs or Rentokil Initial ordinary shares may trade at any time subsequent to\nthe announcement of the transaction. In connection with Lazard\u2019s engagement, Lazard was authorized to\nsolicit indications of interest regarding a potential transaction with Terminix from a limited number of third\nparties. In addition, Lazard\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the transaction as compared to\nany other transaction or business strategy in which Terminix might engage or the merits of the underlying\ndecision by Terminix to engage in the transaction.\nIn rendering its opinion, Lazard assumed, with the consent of Terminix, that the transaction will be\nconsummated on the terms described in the merger agreement, without any waiver or modification of any\nmaterial terms or conditions. Representatives of Terminix advised Lazard, and Lazard assumed, that the\nmerger agreement, when executed, would conform to the draft reviewed by Lazard in all material respects.\nLazard also assumed, with the consent of Terminix, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or\nthird-party approvals and consents for the transaction will not have an adverse effect on Terminix, Rentokil\nInitial or the transaction. Lazard further assumed, with the consent of Terminix, that the transaction will\nqualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the\nCode. Lazard did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the\ntransaction, nor did Lazard\u2019s opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which\nLazard understood that Terminix obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.\nLazard expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than the merger consideration to\nthe extent expressly specified in Lazard\u2019s opinion) of the transaction, including, without limitation, the form\nor structure of the transaction or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or\ncontemplated by, the transaction. In addition, Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness of the\namount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any officers, directors or\nemployees of any parties to the transaction, or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or\notherwise.\nSummary of the Financial Analyses of Terminix\u2019s Financial Advisor\nIn preparing its opinion to the Terminix board of directors, Lazard performed a variety of financial and\ncomparative analyses. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the\nfinancial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying Lazard\u2019s opinion, nor does the order\nof the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial\nanalyses. The preparation of a financial opinion or analysis is a complex process involving various\ndeterminations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of\nthose methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion or analysis is not readily\nsusceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Lazard considered the results of all of the\nanalyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with\nregard to any particular factor or method of analysis considered by it. Rather, Lazard made its determination\nas to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of\nthe analyses. Accordingly, Lazard believes that its analyses and factors summarized below must be\nconsidered as a whole and in context. Lazard further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and\nfactors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors\nor the narrative description of the analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying its analyses and opinion.\nIn performing its analyses, Lazard considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and\nfinancial conditions and other matters, existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the\ncontrol of Terminix and Rentokil Initial. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly\ncomparable to Terminix, Rentokil Initial or their respective businesses or the transaction. Accordingly, an\nevaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning business, financial and operating characteristics and other factors\nthat could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions\nreviewed or views regarding the comparability of such companies, businesses or transactions. Accordingly,\nsuch analyses may not necessarily include all companies, businesses or transactions that could\n91 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbe deemed relevant. The estimates of the future performance of Terminix and Rentokil Initial in or underlying\nLazard\u2019s analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily\nindicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less\nfavorable than those estimates or those suggested by the analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the\nvalue of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company\nmay actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future.\nAccordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any\nparticular analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken\nas the views of Lazard regarding the actual values of Rentokil Initial or Terminix. Except as otherwise noted,\nthe following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data\nas it existed on or before December 13, 2021, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nLazard did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in\nthe transaction. The type and amount of merger consideration payable in the transaction was determined\nthrough negotiations between Terminix and Rentokil Initial, rather than by any financial advisor, and was\napproved by the Terminix board of directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that\nof the Terminix board of directors and the Rentokil Initial board of directors. Lazard\u2019s opinion and analyses\nwere only one of many factors considered by the Terminix board of directors in its evaluation of the\ntransaction and the merger consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the\nTerminix board of directors or management with respect to the transaction or the merger consideration\npayable in the transaction.\nFinancial Analyses\nThe summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled \u201c- Financial Analyses\u201d is a summary of the\nmaterial financial analyses provided by Lazard in connection with its opinion, dated December 13, 2021, to the\nTerminix board of directors. The summary set forth below is not a comprehensive description of all analyses\nundertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of the analyses in the summary below indicate\nthat any analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. The financial analyses summarized below include\ninformation presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Lazard\u2019s financial analyses, the tables must be\nread together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial\nanalyses performed by Lazard. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative\ndescription of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could\ncreate a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Lazard. Future results may differ from\nthose described and such differences may be material.\nFor purposes of the financial analyses described below in this section, the term \u201cimplied per share merger\nconsideration\u201d means approximately $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock, consisting of (i) the cash\nconsideration of the per share cash amount per share of Terminix common stock and (ii) an implied value of\nthe stock consideration of approximately $44.00 per share, which is calculated based on (x) an exchange ratio\nof 5.3094 shares of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares (in the form of 1.0619 Rentokil Initial ADS based on 5:1\nratio of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares for each Rentokil Initial ADS) for one share of Terminix common\nstock, (y) the average of the volume weighted average trading prices of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares on\neach of the five consecutive trading days ending on December 10, 2021 of \u00a36.27 and (z) an exchange rate of 1\nGBP to 1.3225 USD based on the average GBP to USD exchange rates on each of the five consecutive trading\ndays ending on December 10, 2021.\nThe financial data utilized for Terminix in the financial analyses described below were based on financial\nforecasts and other data prepared by Terminix\u2019s management relating to the business of Terminix. Lazard was\nnot provided with, and did not have access to, financial forecasts relating to Rentokil Initial prepared by the\nmanagement of Rentokil Initial. The financial data utilized for Rentokil Initial in the financial analyses\ndescribed below were based on the Terminix management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections.\n92 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTerminix Financial Analyses\nComparable Public Companies Analysis\nUsing public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard compared certain financial information\nof Terminix to corresponding financial information for selected publicly traded companies that, based on\nLazard\u2019s professional judgment and experience, Lazard considered generally relevant for purposes of\nanalysis. Due to the limited number of comparable publicly traded companies in the pest control industry, for\npurposes of its analysis, Lazard included companies in the broader residential and commercial services\nindustry. The selected companies used in this analysis were as follows:\nPest Control (collectively, the \u201cPest Control Peers\u201d)\nRollins, Inc.\nRentokil Initial\nResidential Services (collectively, the \u201cResidential Peers\u201d)\nFirstService Corporation\nFrontdoor, Inc.\nHomeServe plc\nLeslie\u2019s, Inc.\nCommercial Services (collectively, the \u201cCommercial Peers\u201d)\nABM Industries Incorporated\nAramark\nBrightView Holdings, Inc.\nCintas Corporation\nEcolab Inc.\nGDI Integrated Facility Services Inc.\nLazard selected the companies above because, among other things, the selected companies operate\nbusinesses similar in certain respects to the business of Terminix. Terminix is a leading provider of pest and\ntermite management services across residential and commercial markets. Pest Control Peers include large pest\nand termite control companies providing comparable services to Terminix across both residential and\ncommercial end-markets. Given the limited number of public companies singularly focused on pest control,\nLazard expanded the Terminix peer set to include residential and commercial service providers focused on\nservices other than pest control. Residential Peers include companies that provide services primarily to\nresidential end-markets, such as appliance repair and maintenance, pool care and property services.\nCommercial Peers include companies that provide services primarily to commercial end-markets, such as food\nservices, uniform services, commercial landscaping and other facility maintenance. However, none of the\nselected companies is identical to Terminix and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are\nmaterially different from those of Terminix. Based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard\nbelieves that purely quantitative analyses are not, in isolation, determinative in the context of the merger\nconsideration and that qualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and\noperating characteristics and prospects of Terminix and the selected companies that could affect the public\ntrading values of each company are also relevant.\nAs set forth in the table below, for each selected company, Lazard calculated its enterprise value (defined as\nequity market value, plus debt, lease liabilities, preferred stock and minority interests, less cash and cash\nequivalents) as a multiple of its EBITDA (defined as estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation\nand amortization, and adjusted for lease expenses (excluding short-term and variable expenses) for\ncompanies reporting in U.S. GAAP) for calendar year 2022 (\u201cEV / 2022 EBITDA\u201d). The EV /\n93 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n2022 EBITDA multiple observed for the Pest Control Peer (other than Rentokil Initial) was 24.8x.

Enterprise value includes operating lease liabilities and EBITDA includes\noperating lease expense (excluding short-term and variable expenses)\u037e adjustment is made for comparability\nwith Rentokil Initial financials.\nUsing its professional judgment and experience, Lazard applied a range of multiples of estimated EV / 2022\nEBITDA, derived from the EV / 2022 EBITDA multiples of the selected companies, of 12.0x to 16.0x, to\nTerminix\u2019s estimated EBITDA for calendar year 2022. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value\nper share of Terminix common stock of $36.80 to $51.20 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the\nimplied per share merger consideration of $55.00.\nPrecedent Transactions Analysis\nLazard reviewed and analyzed, to the extent publicly available, financial information for selected precedent\ntransactions involving companies (i) in the pest control industry and (ii) in the consumer / commercial\nservices industry that Lazard believed, based on its experience and professional judgment, to be generally\nrelevant for purposes of this analysis. Terminix is a leading provider of pest and termite management\nservices, thus Lazard\u2019s precedent transaction analysis included transactions with targets largely focused on\npest control. Given the limited number of transactions singularly focused on pest control, Lazard expanded\nits analysis to include relevant transactions in consumer and commercial services. Lazard included consumer\nand commercial services transactions on the basis of Terminix\u2019s participation in similar services end-markets.\nThese transactions included targets performing services including tree care, landscaping, restoration,\ncleaning, uniform and facility services.\nAlthough none of the selected precedent transactions or the companies party to such transactions is\ndirectly comparable to the transaction or to Terminix, the selected precedent transactions were chosen\nbecause certain aspects of the precedent transactions, for purposes of this analysis and based on the\nprofessional judgment and experience of Lazard, may be considered similar to the transaction. The analyses\nnecessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\n94 \n(*) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\noperational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the transactions\ndifferently than they would affect the transaction.

The mean EV / LTM EBITDA multiple observed for\nthe selected pest control transactions was 18.3x. The mean EV / LTM EBITDA multiple observed for the\nselected consumer / commercial services transactions was 17.4x. Lazard applied a range of EV / LTM EBITDA\nmultiples of 18.0x to 20.0x derived from the selected precedent transactions to Terminix\u2019s EBITDA for the 12\nmonths ending September 30, 2021. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of\nTerminix common stock of $52.60 to $59.15 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied per\nshare merger consideration of $55.00.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nLazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Terminix by calculating, based on the forecasts\nprovided by Terminix\u2019s management, the estimated present value (as of September 30, 2021) of the stand-\nalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Terminix was forecasted to generate during the fourth quarter\nof calendar year 2021 and during calendar years 2022 through 2025. Lazard also calculated a range of implied\nterminal values for Terminix by applying a selected range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 2.5% to the\nstand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flow attributable to Terminix for calendar year 2025, which range of\nperpetuity growth rates was selected based on Lazard\u2019s professional judgment and experience, taking into\naccount, among other things, the forecasts provided by Terminix\u2019s management and trends in the overall\neconomy generally and in the industries and sectors in which Terminix operates. The cash flows and range of\nimplied terminal values were then discounted to present value (as of September 30, 2021) using a selected\nrange of discount rates of 7.8% to 8.8% derived based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation.\nThis analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Terminix common stock of $42.90 to\n$56.35 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied per share merger consideration of $55.00.\n95 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRentokil Initial Financial Analyses\nComparable Public Companies Analysis\nUsing public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard compared certain financial information\nof Rentokil Initial to corresponding financial information for selected publicly traded companies that, based\non Lazard\u2019s professional judgment and experience, Lazard considered generally relevant for purposes of\nanalysis. Due to the limited number of comparable publicly traded companies in the pest control industry, for\npurposes of its analysis, Lazard included companies in the broader residential and commercial services\nindustry.

Like Terminix, Rentokil Initial is a\nleading provider of pest and termite management services across residential and commercial markets. The\nPest Control Peers include large pest and termite control companies providing comparable services to\nRentokil Initial across both residential and commercial end-markets. Given the limited number of public\ncompanies singularly focused on pest control, Lazard expanded the Rentokil Initial peer set to include\nresidential and commercial service providers focused on services other than pest control. The Residential\nServices Peers include companies that provide services primarily to residential end-markets, such as\nappliance repair and maintenance, pool care and property services. The Commercial Services Peers include\ncompanies that provide services primarily to commercial end-markets, such as food services, uniform\nservices, commercial landscaping and other facility maintenance.\nAs set forth in the table below, using its professional judgment and experience, Lazard applied a range of\nmultiples of estimated EV / 2022 EBITDA, derived from the EV / 2022 EBITDA multiples of the selected\ncompanies, of 15.0x to 19.0x, to Rentokil Initial\u2019s estimated EBITDA for calendar year 2022.\n96 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(U.S. dollars in millions)\nCompany\nEnterprise\nValue\nEV / EBITDA\n2022E\nEBITDA 2022E\nPest Control Peers\nRollins, Inc.\n$\n16,571\n24.8x\n$\n669\nTerminix Global Holdings, Inc.\n5,508\n12.6x\n436\nResidential Peers\nFirstService Corporation\n$\n9,507\n24.4x\n$\n390\nFrontdoor, Inc.\n3,406\n10.1x\n336\nHomeServe plc\n4,967\n11.0x\n452\nLeslie\u2019s, Inc.\n4,893\n13.5x\n361\nCommercial Peers\nABM Industries Incorporated\n$\n3,466\n6.3x\n$\n549\nAramark\n16,645\n11.0x\n1,510\nBrightView Holdings, Inc.\n2,655\n8.3x\n319\nCintas Corporation\n51,022\n24.6x\n2,077\nEcolab Inc.\n72,706\n21.4x\n3,402\nGDI Integrated Facility Services Inc.\n1,114\n10.7x\n105\nNote: Terminix shown on a consensus basis.

Lazard also\ncalculated a range of implied terminal values for Rentokil Initial by applying a selected range of perpetuity\ngrowth rates of 2.0% to 2.5% to the stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flow attributable to Rentokil\nInitial for calendar year 2025, which range of perpetuity growth rates was selected based on Lazard\u2019s\nprofessional judgment and experience, taking into account, among other things, the Terminix management\nunaudited Rentokil Initial projections and trends in the overall economy generally and in the industries and\nsectors in which Rentokil Initial operates. The cash flows and range of implied terminal values were then\ndiscounted to present value (as of September 30, 2021) using a selected range of discount rates of 5.3% to\n6.3% derived based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation.\nThis analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares of \u00a34.85\nto \u00a37.70 (rounded to the nearest \u00a30.05), as compared to the closing price of \u00a36.26 per Rentokil Initial ordinary\nshare on December 8, 2021.\nImplied Exchange Ratio Analysis\nLazard used the implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for Terminix common stock and\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares indicated in the selected public companies analysis and the discounted cash\nflow analyses described above and calculated ranges of implied exchange ratios of Rentokil Initial ordinary\nshares to Terminix common stock.\n97 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe implied reference range of exchange ratios was determined by (i) using as the low end, the amount\ncalculated by dividing the low end of the implied per share equity value reference range for Terminix (minus\nthe per share cash amount), by the high end of the implied per share equity value reference range for\nRentokil Initial and (ii) using as the high end, the amount calculated by dividing the high end of the implied\nper share equity value reference range for Terminix (minus the per share cash amount) by the low end of the\nimplied per share equity value reference range for Rentokil Initial. This analysis resulted in the following\nrange of implied exchange ratio of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to Terminix common stock:\nComparable Public Companies Analysis\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nAnalysis\n2.901x\u202f-\u202f5.887x\n3.125x\u202f-\u202f7.042x\nOther Analyses\nLazard observed certain additional information that was not considered part of its financial analyses for its\nopinion but was noted for informational reference for the Terminix board of directors, including the following:\nCertain Terminix Financial Analyses\nLazard applied the calculations described above under \u201c- Financial Analyses\u202f-\u202fTerminix Financial\nAnalyses\u202f-\u202fComparable Public Companies Analysis\u201d utilizing the Wall Street equity analysts\u2019 consensus\nestimates for Terminix in lieu of the forecasts provided by Terminix\u2019s management.

Lazard first calculated the theoretical per share equity value of Terminix common stock as of\nDecember 31, 2023 by applying a range of next 12 months (\u201cNTM\u201d) multiples of 12.7x to 14.7x to Terminix\u2019s\nestimated EBITDA for calendar year 2024 (based on the forecasts provided by Terminix\u2019s management).\nLazard then calculated the resulting range of implied per share equity values as of December 31, 2023 and\ndiscounted that range to present value using a discount rate of 9.4%, which reflects an estimate of Terminix\u2019s\ncost of equity. This analysis resulted in an implied equity value per share range for Terminix common stock of\n$46.40 to $53.95 (rounded to the nearest $0.05).\nLazard conducted an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future share price of Rentokil\nInitial ordinary shares. Lazard first calculated the theoretical per share equity value of Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares as of December 31, 2023 by applying a range of next NTM multiples of 16.9x to 18.9x to\nestimated Rentokil Initial EBITDA for calendar year 2024 (based on the Terminix management unaudited\nRentokil Initial projections). Lazard then calculated the resulting range of implied per share equity values as\nof December 31, 2023 and discounted that range to present value using a discount rate of 7.0%, which\nreflects an estimate of Rentokil Initial\u2019s cost of equity. Lazard also calculated the estimated annual dividend\npayments before December 31, 2023 and discounted them to present value using a discount rate of 7.0% and\nincluded such present values in the implied equity value per share. This analysis resulted in an implied\nequity value per share range for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares of \u00a36.50 to \u00a37.25 (rounded to the nearest\n\u00a30.05).\nLazard then calculated an implied exchange ratio reference range by dividing the low end of the implied per\nshare equity value reference range for Terminix (minus the per share cash amount), by the high end of the\nimplied per share equity value reference range for Rentokil Initial, in each case as determined by the present\nvalue of future share price analysis described above, and by dividing the high end of the implied\n98 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nper share equity value reference range for Terminix (minus the per share cash amount), by the low end of the\nimplied per share equity value reference range for Rentokil Initial, in each case as determined by the present\nvalue of future share price analysis described above. This analysis resulted in a range of implied exchange\nratio of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to Terminix common stock of 3.689x to 5.006x.\nLazard also applied the calculations described in this section utilizing the Wall Street equity analysts\u2019\nconsensus estimates for Terminix in lieu of the forecasts provided by Terminix\u2019s management. This analysis\nresulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Terminix common stock of $37.60 to $44.20 (rounded\nto the nearest $0.05) and a range of implied exchange ratio of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to Terminix\ncommon stock of 2.769x to 3.871x.\nAnalyst Target Prices\nLazard observed price targets for Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares as reflected in\nselected publicly available Wall Street equity research reports. Lazard observed that (x) the future price\ntargets for Terminix common stock ranged from $44.00 per share to $65.00 per share, which Lazard discounted\nto present value based on an illustrative cost of equity of 9.4% to calculate a range of $41.10 per share to\n$58.10 per share (rounded to the nearest $0.05), and (y) the price targets for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares\nranged from \u00a35.10 per share to \u00a36.50 per share.\n52-Week Trading Range\nLazard reviewed the range of historical trading prices of shares of Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares during the 52-week period ended December 8, 2021. Lazard observed that, during this period,\n(x) the daily closing price of Terminix common stock ranged from $36.30 per share (rounded to the nearest\n$0.05) (on December 1, 2021) to $55.00 per share (rounded to the nearest $0.05) (on January 13, 2021), and (y)\nthe daily closing price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares ranged from \u00a34.60 per share (rounded to the nearest\n\u00a30.05) (on March 4, 2021) to \u00a36.40 per share (on November 12, 2021).\nGeneral\nIn connection with Lazard\u2019s services as a financial advisor to the Terminix board of directors, Terminix agreed\nto pay Lazard an aggregate fee of $45 million, $5.0 million of which has been paid and the remainder of which\nis payable contingent upon consummation of the transaction. In addition, Terminix has agreed to reimburse\ncertain of Lazard\u2019s expenses arising, and to indemnify Lazard against certain liabilities that may arise, out of\nLazard\u2019s engagement.\nLazard, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and\ntheir securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary\ndistributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, leveraged buyouts, and valuations for\nestate, corporate and other purposes. In the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard\u2019s opinion, Lazard has\nprovided certain investment banking services to Terminix, for which Lazard received compensation, including\nhaving advised Terminix in the sale of ServiceMaster Brands (for which Lazard received aggregate fees of\napproximately $20 million). In the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard\u2019s opinion, Lazard has not been\nengaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Rentokil Initial and Lazard has not received any\ncompensation from Rentokil Initial during this period. In addition, in the ordinary course, Lazard and its\naffiliates and employees may trade securities of Terminix, Rentokil Initial and certain of their respective\naffiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time\nhold a long or short position in such securities, and may also trade and hold securities on behalf of Terminix,\nRentokil Initial and certain of their respective affiliates. The issuance of Lazard\u2019s opinion was approved by\nthe opinion committee of Lazard.\nLazard is an internationally recognized investment banking firm providing a full range of financial advisory\nand other services. Lazard was selected to act as investment banker to Terminix because of its qualifications,\nexpertise and reputation in investment banking and mergers and acquisitions generally and in particular, as\nan advisor to companies in Terminix\u2019s sector, as well as its familiarity with the business of Terminix.\n99",

            "text": "Certain Terminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nWhile Terminix has from time to time provided a financial outlook to investors with respect to the then-\ncurrent fiscal year, Terminix has not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed longer-term internal\nprojections as to future performance, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty,\nunpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, as described under\nthe section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Proposal - Background of the\nTransaction,\u201d beginning on page 77, in the ordinary course of business Terminix management prepares a\nstrategy plan, which is periodically updated and reviewed with the Terminix board of directors, that reflects\nTerminix management\u2019s financial and business outlook for Terminix over a five-year period. As part of\nTerminix\u2019s annual business review, Terminix management prepared and provided to the Terminix board of\ndirectors certain nonpublic, internal financial projections included in the Terminix strategy plan regarding\nTerminix\u2019s future operations for fiscal years 2021 through 2025, and these projections were reviewed by the\nTerminix board of directors on September 1, 2021 (as defined earlier, the \u201cSeptember 2021 Terminix\nmanagement unaudited Terminix projections\u201d). On October 7, 2021, Terminix management provided a copy of\nthe September 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections to Lazard, and a copy was\nsubsequently made available to Rentokil Initial and its financial advisors, Barclays and Goldman Sachs\nInternational.\nLater that month, in conjunction with the normal review of Terminix\u2019s financial performance against\nTerminix\u2019s long-term incentive targets, Terminix management prepared certain updates to the September 2021\nTerminix management unaudited Terminix projections to reflect, among other factors, Terminix\u2019s actual\nfinancial results for the period from July 1, 2021 through August 31, 2021 (as defined earlier, the \u201cOctober\n2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections\u201d). These results, and the associated estimated\neffect on future periods, were negatively impacted by lower staffing levels caused by the insourcing of\ncertain national accounts customers as well as an increase in worker mobility during a robust labor market.\nOn October 19, 2021, the October 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections were provided to\nLazard and subsequently reviewed by the Terminix board of directors at its meeting on October 21, 2021.\nThereafter, in December, Terminix management engaged in its regular year-end review of projected near-term\nfinancial performance for fiscal years 2021 and 2022, which resulted in certain refinements to the October\n2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections for those fiscal years to reflect, among other\nfactors, Terminix\u2019s actual financial results for the period from September 1, 2021 through October 31, 2021.\nThese updated projections were provided to Lazard on December 7, 2021 (and a copy was subsequently\nmade available to Rentokil Initial and Rentokil Initial\u2019s financial advisors, Barclays and Goldman Sachs\nInternational) and were reviewed by the Terminix board of directors on December 10, 2021 (as defined earlier,\nthe \u201cDecember 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections\u201d).\nTerminix directed Lazard to use and rely upon, for purposes of its financial analysis and fairness opinion, the\nDecember 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 and the\nOctober 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections for fiscal years 2023 through 2025. Based\non guidance from, and at the direction of, Terminix management, in preparing its analysis and fairness\nopinion, Lazard added $25 million in operating leases to adjusted EBITDA for each fiscal year over the five-\nyear period to facilitate comparison against Rentokil Initial\u2019s corresponding financial information presented\nin accordance with IFRS (the \u201cLazard fairness opinion Terminix management unaudited Terminix\nprojections\u201d).\nWe refer to the September 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections, the October 2021\nTerminix management unaudited Terminix projections, the December 2021 Terminix management unaudited\nTerminix projections and the Lazard fairness opinion Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections\ncollectively as the \u201cTerminix management unaudited Terminix projections.\u201d\n100 TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nIn connection with the transaction, Terminix management also reviewed certain unaudited prospective\nfinancial information concerning Rentokil Initial on a stand-alone basis contained in publicly available Wall\nStreet research analyst financial forecasts and consensus estimates (and extrapolations therefrom) for the\nfiscal years ending December 31, 2021 through December 31, 2025. We refer to these unaudited projections\nas the \u201cTerminix management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections,\u201d and to the Terminix management\nunaudited Terminix projections and the Terminix management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections,\ncollectively, as the \u201cTerminix management unaudited projections.\u201d The Terminix management unaudited\nRentokil Initial projections were provided to the Terminix board of directors in connection with its\nconsideration of the proposed transaction as well as to Lazard, which was directed by Terminix management\nto use and rely upon the Terminix management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections for purposes of its\nfinancial analysis and fairness opinion.\nThe Terminix management unaudited projections were prepared treating Terminix and Rentokil Initial,\nrespectively, on a stand-alone basis, without giving effect to the proposed transaction, including any impact\nof the negotiation or execution of the proposed transaction, the expenses that may be incurred in connection\nwith the proposed transaction or the consummation thereof, the potential synergies that may be achieved by\nthe combined company as a result of the proposed transaction, the effect of any business or strategic\ndecision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed or\nin anticipation of the proposed transaction, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions\nwhich would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed but which were instead\naltered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the transaction. In connection with the\nproposed transaction, Terminix management prepared pro-forma analyses which were presented to the\nTerminix board of directors and assumed $175 million of annual pre-tax cost synergies, with 25% of the\namount to be achieved during 2022, 75% of the amount to be achieved during 2023, and the full amount to be\nachieved during 2024 and subsequent years. Terminix management assumed that the aggregate cost of\nachieving the projected cost synergies would be $175 million, with 25% of the amount to be incurred during\n2022, 50% of the amount to be incurred during 2023, and 25% of the amount to be incurred during 2024.\nThese assumed cost synergies including cost to achieve such cost synergies, as defined earlier and which\nwe refer to collectively as the \u201cTerminix management assumed cost synergies,\u201d are not reflected in the\nTerminix management unaudited projections. The Terminix management assumed cost synergies were\nprovided to Lazard, which was directed by Terminix management to use and rely upon the Terminix\nmanagement assumed cost synergies for purposes of its financial analysis and fairness opinion.\nThe Terminix management unaudited projections are being included in this proxy statement/\u200bprospectus to\ngive stockholders access to certain non-public information provided to the Terminix board of directors and\nTerminix\u2019s financial advisor and to Rentokil Initial and its financial advisors. The inclusion of the financial\nprojections by Terminix should not be regarded as an indication that the Terminix board of directors,\nTerminix, the Rentokil Initial board of directors, Rentokil Initial, Lazard, Barclays or Goldman Sachs\nInternational or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, them to be an\nassurance of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should\nnot be relied on as such.\nIn addition, the Terminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost\nsynergies were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward compliance with the\npublished guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for\npreparation or presentation of prospective financial information, IFRS or GAAP, but, in the view of Terminix\u2019s\nmanagement were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the\ntime of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of management\u2019s knowledge and\nbelief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of Terminix or Rentokil\nInitial, as applicable. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being\nnecessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement/\u200bprospectus are cautioned not to\nplace undue reliance on the Terminix management unaudited projections or the Terminix management\nassumed cost synergies. Although Terminix\u2019s management believes there is a reasonable basis for the\nTerminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost synergies, Terminix\ncautions stockholders that future results could be materially different from the Terminix management\nunaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost synergies. This summary of the Terminix\nmanagement unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost\n101 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsynergies is included in this proxy statement/prospectus because the Terminix management unaudited\nprojections and the Terminix management assumed cost synergies were provided to Terminix\u2019s financial\nadvisor and to the Terminix board of directors for purposes of considering and evaluating the transaction\nand the merger agreement.\nThe Terminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost synergies are\nsubject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While\npresented with numerical specificity, the Terminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix\nmanagement assumed cost synergies are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are\ninherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by Terminix\u2019s management as of the date of their\npreparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons,\nincluding general economic conditions, trends in the pest control industry, the regulatory environment,\ncompetition, and the risks discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus under the sections entitled\n\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on pages\n63 and 37, respectively. See also \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information\u201d beginning on page 328 of\nthis proxy statement/prospectus. The Terminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix\nmanagement assumed cost synergies also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are\nsubject to change. Because the Terminix management unaudited projections were developed for Terminix on\na stand-alone basis without giving effect to the transaction, they do not reflect any synergies that may be\nrealized as a result of the transaction or any changes to Terminix\u2019s or Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations or strategy\nthat may be implemented after completion of the transaction. There can be no assurance that the Terminix\nmanagement unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost synergies will be realized, and\nactual results may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the\nTerminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost synergies relate, the\nless predictable and more unreliable the information becomes.\nThe Terminix management unaudited projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Terminix\nbelieves are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and future results. Terminix management\nregularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP or IFRS for forecasting,\nbudgeting and measuring financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP or IFRS measures. While Terminix believes\nthat these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to help investors understand the\noperating results and to analyze Terminix\u2019s financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis, there\nare limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP or IFRS, are not reported by all of Terminix\u2019s or Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Terminix\u2019s or Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation.\nNone of Terminix, Rentokil Initial, the combined company or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers,\ndirectors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the\nTerminix management unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost synergies, and none\nof them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Terminix management\nunaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost synergies to reflect circumstances existing\nafter the date the Terminix management unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost\nsynergies were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the\nassumptions underlying the Terminix management unaudited projections or the Terminix management\nassumed cost synergies, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable securities\nlaws, Terminix does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the Terminix\nmanagement unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost synergies, even in the event\nthat any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. None of Terminix, Rentokil Initial or their affiliates,\nadvisors, officers, directors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any Terminix\nstockholder or other person regarding Terminix\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the information\ncontained in the Terminix management unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost\nsynergies or that forecasted results will be achieved. Terminix has made no representation to Rentokil Initial,\nin the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the Terminix management unaudited projections or the\nTerminix management assumed cost synergies.\n102 \n(1) \n(2) \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nThe Terminix unaudited prospective financial information included in this document has been prepared by,\nand is the responsibility of, Terminix management.

The\nTerminix board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in\nevaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger\nagreement and the transactions contemplated therein, including the merger, and in recommending to Terminix\nstockholders that the merger agreement be approved. Such interests are described below.

Terminix\u2019s obligations will consist of those obligations accrued at the date of termination, including\npayment of earned salary, vacation and reimbursement of expenses.\nUnder the employment agreement entered into by and between Terminix and Mr. Ponton dated September 15,\n2020, if Terminix terminates Mr. Ponton\u2019s employment without \u201ccause\u201d or Mr. Ponton terminates his\nemployment for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (each term as defined in the employment agreement) within 24 months after a\nchange in control of Terminix (which would include the merger), Mr. Ponton would receive: (1) a lump sum\npayment equal to the sum of (x) two times the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary and (y) two times the\nexecutive officer\u2019s annual target cash bonus under the AIP, and (2) a prorated bonus for the year in which his\ntermination occurs through his date of termination. Payments of Mr. Ponton\u2019s severance benefits are subject\nto Mr. Ponton signing a general release of claims. Mr. Ponton is also subject to covenants not to compete or\nsolicit customers or employees for two years following any termination of employment and an indefinite\ncovenant not to disclose confidential information.\nThe merger agreement with Rentokil Initial provides for enhanced severance practices and guidelines\npursuant to a change in control severance program adopted in connection with the merger covering all\nemployees of Terminix (the \u201cChange in Control Severance Program\u201d). Under this program, in the event of a\ntermination of any of Messrs. Riesbeck, Dart, Persson or Ms. Richardson\u2019s employment without \u201ccause\u201d by\nTerminix or for \u201cgood reason\u201d by the officer (each term as generally defined above) within 12 months after\nthe closing of the merger, such individual would be entitled to receive (i) a lump sum payment equal to two\ntimes the sum of the executive officer\u2019s (x) annual base salary and (y) annual target cash bonus under the\nAIP, each as in effect upon the qualifying termination of employment\u037e (ii) to the extent such qualifying\ntermination occurs on or after July 1 of the given calendar year, a prorated AIP bonus in respect of the year\nof termination\u037e and (iii) monthly payment of the employer portion of medical continuation coverage (+2%),\nless the then-active employee medical insurance premium rates for up to 18 months after the qualifying\ntermination of employment. Mr. Ponton is also entitled to such monthly reimbursements equal to the excess\nof COBRA medical continuation coverage (+2%), less the then-active employee medical insurance premium\nrates for up to 18 months after his qualifying termination of employment under the Change in Control\nSeverance Program.

The retention awards are\ndesigned to retain and incentivize the Terminix team as it executes the 2022 operating plan, achieves the\nconsummation of the merger and assists with the integration of the combined company after closing of the\ntransaction. Half of the Retention Pool has been allocated specifically to customer-facing, field operations\nteammates, and the remainder has been allocated to key back-office teammates, including to the named\nexecutive officers detailed below.\nUnder the merger agreement, the Compensation Committee of the Terminix board of directors is authorized to\ngrant retention awards from the Retention Pool, if any, to Terminix\u2019s executive officers, in an amount not to\nexceed $13 million in the aggregate. On February 17, 2022, the Compensation Committee approved retention\nawards from the Retention Pool pursuant to retention agreements with each of the executive officers. The\nretention agreement for Mr. Ponton provides for a $2.5 million retention award, 40% of which is payable upon\nconsummation of the merger and 60% of which is payable on the later of (i) three months from the date of\nconsummation of the merger or (ii) August 21, 2023. If the merger does not close, 100% of Mr. Ponton\u2019s\nretention award would be payable on February 21, 2024. The retention agreements for Messrs. Riesbeck, Dart\nand Persson and Ms. Richardson each provide for a $350,000 retention award, 50% of which is payable upon\nconsummation of the merger and 50% of which is payable on the later of (i) three months after consummation\nof the merger or (ii) August 21, 2023. If the merger does not close, 100% of the retention awards for Messrs.\nRiesbeck, Dart and Persson would be payable on August 21, 2023\u037e however, if the merger agreement is\nterminated in accordance with its terms prior to August 21, 2023, 50% of the retention award to Messrs.\nRiesbeck, Dart and Persson and Ms. Richardson would be paid within five business days of such termination\nand 50% would be payable on August 21, 2023. Each of the retention agreements provides that if the named\nexecutive officer\u2019s employment is terminated by Terminix without cause after consummation of the merger,\nthe unpaid portion of the retention award will be paid within five business days following the date of\ntermination of employment.\nExcise Tax Reimbursement Plan\nIn connection with the merger, Terminix may implement a plan pursuant to which each named executive\nofficer (among other employees) will be entitled to receive a full or partial reimbursement payment in the\nevent that any payments or benefits provided to such executive officer in connection with the merger\nbecome subject to the excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The reimbursement\npayments would generally place the executive officers in the same after-tax position as if the excise tax did\nnot apply to them. The aggregate amount of all such reimbursement payments cannot exceed $10 million,\nwith the reimbursement payments to be reasonably allocated in a manner that does not result in a payment\nbeing made to any given employee which is disproportionately large when compared to the\n109 \nst\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\namount by which the employee\u2019s payments subject to the excise tax exceeds the statutorily determined\nemployee-specific threshold of payments below which the excise tax is not imposed. At this time, no named\nexecutive officer has been granted any rights to receive any such reimbursement payment, and there is no\nguarantee that any such payments will be made.\nIndemnification\u037e Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Terminix\u2019s non-employee directors and executive officers will\nbe entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance\npolicies following the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the\nsection of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fIndemnification and\nInsurance\u201d beginning on page 158.\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Terminix Named Executive Officers in Connection with the\nMerger\nThis section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation\nof each of Terminix\u2019s named executive officers, that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger and that\nwill or may become payable to the named executive officers at the completion of the merger or on a qualifying\ntermination of employment upon or following the consummation of the merger. This compensation is referred\nto as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use\nsuch term to describe the merger-related compensation payable to the Terminix named executive officers. The\n\u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of\nTerminix stockholders. The \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d are the individuals listed as such in Terminix\u2019s most\nrecent annual proxy statement.\nFor additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion\nunder the caption \u201cThe Merger Proposal\u202f-\u202fInterests of Terminix\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nTransaction\u201d beginning on page 105 above.\nCertain Assumptions\nThe table below sets forth, for the purposes of this golden parachute disclosure, the amount of payments\nand benefits (on a pre-tax basis) that each of Terminix\u2019s named executive officers would receive based on\ncertain assumptions set forth below and in the footnotes to the tables.

The original complaint generally\nalleged, among other things, that certain subsidiaries of Terminix violated the non-compete restriction under\nthe licensee\u2019s license agreement and the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act. As\nsupplemented, the Bruce Lawsuit further generally alleges, among other things, that a Rentokil Initial\nsubsidiary currently competes in the licensee\u2019s territory and that the transaction would violate the non-\ncompete restriction under the licensee\u2019s license agreement. The Bruce Lawsuit also alleges, among other\nthings, that Bruce would suffer irreparable harm from purported competition with Rentokil Initial should the\ntransaction be consummated, and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from\nmerging with Rentokil Initial so long as Rentokil Initial owns pest control companies with locations within\nBruce\u2019s service area and from disclosing to Rentokil Initial certain confidential or proprietary information of\nthe Company. On August 1, 2022, the court denied Bruce\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the\ntransaction. Terminix believes that the claims asserted in the Bruce Lawsuit are without merit.\nIn connection with the transaction, three complaints have been filed by purported Terminix stockholders\nagainst Terminix and its directors, and one draft complaint has been sent to Terminix. The complaints are\ncaptioned Ferreiro v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-04987 (S.D.N.Y.)\u037e Justice v. Terminix\nGlobal Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-05519 (S.D.N.Y.)\u037e and Baker v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., et\nal., No. 1:22-cv-05524 (S.D.N.Y.). The draft complaint is captioned Paxton v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc.,\net al. and does not specify any court. The complaints and draft complaint generally allege that the\npreliminary registration statement filed with the SEC on June 7, 2022 omitted certain allegedly material\ninformation in connection with the transaction in violation of federal proxy laws, and one of the complaints\nfurther alleges that the Terminix directors further breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the\ntransaction and that Terminix aided and abetted that breach. The lawsuits seek various remedies, including:\nenjoining the consummation of the transaction\u037e rescission of the transaction, or rescissory damages in the\nevent the transaction is consummated without the allegedly material disclosures\u037e declaring the merger\nagreement unenforceable\u037e directing dissemination of additional allegedly material disclosures\u037e declaring that\nTerminix and its directors violated federal proxy laws\u037e awarding plaintiffs costs and an allowance for\nattorneys\u2019 and experts fees\u037e and an accounting to the plaintiffs for any damages allegedly suffered.

The following\ndiscussion is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in\nits entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached as Annex C to this\nproxy statement/prospectus. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a\n\u201cstockholder\u201d are to the holder of record of shares of Terminix common stock. The following discussion does\nnot constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that you exercise your\nrights to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, Terminix, not less than 20 days prior to the Terminix special meeting, must\nnotify each stockholder who was a Terminix stockholder on the record date for notice of the Terminix special\nmeeting and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights, that appraisal rights are available and include in the\nnotice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement/prospectus constitutes the required notice\nto Terminix stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the transaction. A holder of\nTerminix common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve the right to do so\nshould review the following discussion and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL as Annex C to this proxy\nstatement/prospectus carefully. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights\nwill be entitled to receive the merger consideration.\nHow to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights. If you are a Terminix stockholder wishing to exercise the\nrights to seek an appraisal of your shares, you must do ALL of the following:\nyou must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy that is signed and\nsubmitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor\nof the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e if you vote by proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal\nrights, you must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting your\nshares\u037e\nyou must deliver to Terminix a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote on the\nadoption of the merger agreement at the Terminix special meeting and such demand must reasonably\ninform Terminix of your identity and your intention to demand appraisal of your shares of Terminix\ncommon stock\u037e\nyou must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the completion\nof the transaction. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer such shares before the\ncompletion of the transaction\u037e and\nyou or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a\ndetermination of the fair value of such shares within 120 days after the completion of the transaction.\nThe surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the Terminix\nstockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of\nTerminix common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nVoting, electronically at the Terminix special meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or\nfailing to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as\nrequired by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate\nfrom any proxy or vote.\nWho May Exercise Appraisal Rights. Only a holder of record of shares of Terminix common stock issued and\noutstanding at the time a demand for appraisal is made and that continue to be issued and outstanding and\nheld of record by such holder immediately prior to the completion of the transaction may assert appraisal\nrights for the shares of Terminix common stock registered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal must\nbe executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as the stockholder\u2019s name\nappears on the stock certificates (or in the stock ledger). The demand for appraisal must reasonably inform\nTerminix of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or\nits common stock. Beneficial owners who do not also hold their shares of common stock\n115 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof record may not directly make appraisal demands to Terminix. The beneficial holder must, in such cases, have the\nowner of record, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those\nshares of common stock of record. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds\nshares of Terminix common stock as a nominee for others, may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with\nrespect to the shares of Terminix common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising\nthis right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of\nTerminix common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Terminix common\nstock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Terminix common stock\nheld in the name of the record owner.\nIF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND\nYOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE\nFIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE\nBANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE\nSHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER\nPERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO\nCAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS\nNECESSARY TO PERFECT YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nIf you own shares of Terminix common stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or\ntenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An\nauthorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a\nstockholder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact\nthat, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the record owner. If you hold shares of\nTerminix common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities\ndepository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on\nbehalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.\nIf you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written\ndemand to:\nTerminix Global Holdings, Inc. \n150 Peabody Place \nMemphis, Tennessee 38103 \nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nRentokil Initial\u2019s Actions After the Completion of the Transaction. If the transaction is completed, the\nsurviving company will give written notice of the completion of the transaction to you within 10 days after\nthe completion of the transaction if you did not vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and you\nmade a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days\nafter the completion of the transaction, if you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a\nproceeding as a named party, you have the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the merger\nconsideration in accordance with the merger agreement for your shares of Terminix common stock. Within\n120 days after the completion of the transaction, but not later, either you, provided you have complied with\nthe requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, or the surviving company may commence an appraisal\nproceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving\ncompany in the case of a petition filed by you, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of\nTerminix common stock held by all dissenting stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. The\nsurviving company is under no obligation to file an appraisal petition and has no intention of doing so. If\nyou desire to have your shares appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of\nyour appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the completion of the transaction, provided you have complied with the provisions of\nSection 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to receive from the surviving company, upon your written\nrequest, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement and with respect to which Terminix has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of holders of those shares. The surviving company must mail this statement to you within\n116 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe later of 10 days of receipt of the request or 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands\nfor appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of Terminix common stock held in a voting trust or by\na nominee on your behalf you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the surviving\ncompany the statement described in this paragraph. As noted above, however, a demand for appraisal may\nonly be made by or on behalf of a holder of record of shares of Terminix common stock. If a petition for\nappraisal is duly filed by you or another record holder of Terminix common stock who has properly exercised\nhis or her appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, the surviving\ncompany will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide\nthe office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed with a duly verified list containing the\nnames and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may order the Register in Chancery to give notice of the time and place fixed for\nthe hearing on the petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving company and to the stockholders\nshown on such duly verified list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice will also be published at least\none week before the day of the hearing in at least one newspaper of general circulation published in the City\nof Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication deemed advisable by the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nThe costs of these notices are borne by the surviving company. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then\ndetermine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders demanding\nappraisal who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for\nnotation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and the Delaware Court of Chancery may\ndismiss from the proceedings any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. If immediately before a\nmerger the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights\nare available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Delaware Court of Chancery shall dismiss the\nproceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total\nnumber of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for\nappraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the transaction for such total number of shares\nexceeds $1 million or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to Section 253 or 267 of the DGCL. The Terminix\ncommon stock is listed on the NYSE and therefore this provision may be applicable in respect thereof, to the\nextent that Terminix common stock continues to be listed on the NYSE until immediately before the\ntransaction.\nAfter determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of Terminix common stock, the\nappraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of Terminix common stock owned by such\nstockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules\nspecifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the\nfair value of the shares of Terminix common stock at the completion of the transaction held by dissenting\nstockholders who have properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the transaction, together with interest, if any, to be paid.\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and\nexcept as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the completion of the transaction\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period\nbetween the completion of the transaction and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the\nentry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving company may pay to each Terminix stockholder entitled\nto appraisal an amount in cash (which will be treated as an advance against the payment due to such\nTerminix stockholder), in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only upon the sum of (1) the\ndifference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the fair value is\ndetermined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together\nwith interest, if any, by the surviving company to the Terminix stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be\nso made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and in the case of\nholders of shares of Terminix common stock represented by certificates upon the surrender to the surviving\ncompany of such stockholder\u2019s certificates.\nIn determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant\nfactors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be\nconsidered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\n117 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise\nadmissible in court\u201d should be considered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all\nrelevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making\nthis determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings\nprospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained as of the date of the\ntransaction which throw any light on future prospects of the combined company. Section 262 of the DGCL\nprovides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the [transaction].\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that\nsuch exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather\napplies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In\nWeinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that \u201celements of\nfuture value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of\nthe merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nAn opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value\nunder Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of Terminix common stock as determined under\nSection 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger\nconsideration.\nRentokil Initial does not anticipate offering more than the per share merger consideration to any Terminix\nstockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to\nsubsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of\nSection 262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Terminix common stock is less than the per share\nmerger consideration. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nIf no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective date of the transaction or,\nassuming the shares of Terminix common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately\nbefore the transaction, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied, then all Terminix\nstockholders will lose the right to an appraisal, and will instead receive the per share merger consideration\ndescribed in the merger agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate those\ncosts to the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances.\nEach Terminix stockholder party to the appraisal proceeding is responsible for its own attorneys\u2019 fees and\nexpert witnesses\u2019 fees and expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the\nappraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Terminix common stock entitled to appraisal.\nIf you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after\nthe effective date of the transaction, vote the shares of Terminix common stock subject to the demand for\nany purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to holders of record of Terminix common stock as of a record date prior to the effective\ndate of the transaction.\nIf you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party, you may\nwithdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of\nthe demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger to the surviving corporation, except that any\nattempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require written\napproval of the surviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will\nbe dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval\nmay be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this\nprovision will not affect the right of any Terminix stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who\nhas not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the transaction within 60 days after the\neffective date of the transaction. If you fail to perfect, successfully withdraw your demand for appraisal, or\n118 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\notherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of Terminix common stock will be converted into the right\nto receive the per share merger consideration, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in\nthe loss of your appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger\nconsideration for your shares of Terminix common stock in accordance with the merger agreement. In view of\nthe complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a Terminix stockholder and are\nconsidering exercising your appraisal rights under the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and\nfinancial advisor.\nTHE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH\nTHE PREREQUISITES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL\nRIGHTS, YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS IN\nCONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY\nINCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, THE DGCL\nWILL GOVERN.",

            "text": "The Rentokil Initial Debt Financing\nOverview\nIn order to provide financing certainty for the transaction, on December 13, 2021 Rentokil Initial obtained\nbridge facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $2,700 million from Barclays Bank PLC. On\nFebruary 25, 2022 such commitments were terminated and replaced with bridge and term facility commitments\nhaving an original aggregate principal amount of $2,700 million consisting of (i) \u201cFacility A\u201d, a bridge facility\nhaving an original aggregate principal amount of $2,000 million, which has since been terminated in full as\ndescribed below and (ii) \u201cFacility B\u201d, a term facility having an original aggregate principal amount of $700\nmillion (collectively, the \u201cFinancing Commitments\u201d) provided by a syndicate of banks. On March 25, 2022, an\namendment letter was entered into in respect of the Financing Commitments in order to conform the duration\nof the Financing Commitments to the end date in the merger agreement. On May 25, 2022, an amendment\nletter was entered into in respect of the Financing Commitments in order to permit the Termination Date of\nFacility A to be extended to 1 April 2024.\nOn June 27, 2022, Rentokil Initial and its subsidiary issued (i) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2027 in an\naggregate principal amount of \u20ac850 million, (ii) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2030 in an aggregate\nprincipal amount of \u20ac600 million and (iii) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2032 in an aggregate principal\namount of \u00a3400 million, in each case pursuant to Rentokil Initial\u2019s Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the\n\u201cNew Senior Notes\u201d).

            "text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following discussion is a general summary based on present law of certain U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of\nexchanging their shares of Terminix common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the transaction\nand to U.S. Holders of holding and disposing of Rentokil Initial ADSs received in the transaction. This\ndiscussion is based upon the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code (which we refer\nto as the \u201cTreasury Regulations\u201d), judicial authorities and published positions of the Internal Revenue\nService (\u201cIRS\u201d), all as currently in effect, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations\npossibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the\nstatements and conclusions set forth herein. This discussion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts,\nand neither Rentokil Initial nor Terminix intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax\nconsequences described herein. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or\nthat a court will not sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth in this discussion.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and is not a complete description of all tax\nconsiderations that may be relevant to holders of Terminix common stock\u037e it is not a substitute for tax advice.\nIt applies only to holders that hold their shares of Terminix common stock, and will hold the Rentokil Initial\nADSs received in the transaction, as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221(a) of the\n121 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nCode (generally, property held for investment) and that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. In\naddition, it does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a\nholder of Terminix common stock in light of such holder\u2019s particular circumstances, nor does it apply to\nholders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as banks or other financial\ninstitutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities and organizations, dealers or brokers, traders in\nsecurities that elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, governmental agencies or instrumentalities,\nmutual funds, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships and other pass-\nthrough entities (including S-corporations) and investors therein, U.S. expatriates, pension funds, individual\nretirement and other deferred accounts, \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations, \u201cpassive foreign investment\ncompanies,\u201d \u201cpersonal holding companies,\u201d persons liable for the alternative minimum tax, persons required\nto accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an\n\u201capplicable financial statement,\u201d persons that directly, indirectly or constructively, own or at any time during\nthe five year period ending on the closing date owned, 5% or more of the total combined voting power of\nTerminix\u2019s or Rentokil Initial\u2019s voting stock or of the total value of Terminix\u2019s or Rentokil Initial\u2019s equity\ninterests, persons who received their shares of Terminix common stock through the exercise of employee\nstock options or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan, holders of Terminix\ncommon stock who exercise appraisal rights, U.S. Holders that hold their shares of Terminix common stock,\nor who will hold the Rentokil Initial ADSs, in connection with a permanent establishment or fixed base\noutside the United States, or holders that hold their shares of Terminix common stock or Rentokil Initial\nADSs as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated or risk reduction\nfinancial transaction. This summary also does not address any considerations relating to U.S. federal taxes\nother than income tax (such as estate or gift taxes), any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax laws or\nconsiderations, the Medicare tax on net investment income, any considerations with respect to any\nwithholding required pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury\nRegulations promulgated thereunder and any intergovernmental agreements entered in connection therewith\nand any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement), or, except as\nexpressly addressed below, any reporting requirements.\nAs used in this section, \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of Terminix common stock, and,\nafter the exchange of shares of Terminix common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the\ntransaction, a beneficial owner of Rentokil Initial ADSs received in the transaction, that is, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes: (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or other entity\nor arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any\nstate thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise\nprimary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to\ncontrol all substantial decisions of the trust or (iv) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal\nincome taxation regardless of its source.\nA \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Terminix common stock, and, after the exchange of\nshares of Terminix common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the transaction, a beneficial owner\nof Rentokil Initial ADSs received in the transaction, who is an individual, corporation, estate or trust, in each\ncase, that is not a U.S. Holder.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) exchanging its shares of Terminix common stock for the\nmerger consideration, or holding or disposing of Rentokil Initial ADSs, generally will depend on the status of\nthe partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and persons treated as partners in partnerships\nthat hold shares of Terminix common stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences to them of participating in the transaction and acquiring, owning and\ndisposing of Rentokil Initial ADSs and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.\nThe following discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis or discussion of all U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations relating to the transaction or to the ownership and disposition of Rentokil Initial shares. All holders of\nTerminix common stock should consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the\ntransaction and of the ownership and disposition of Rentokil Initial shares, including with respect to reporting\nrequirements and the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws in light of their\nparticular circumstances.\n122 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThis discussion under \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\u201d assumes that a U.S. Holder of\nRentokil Initial ADSs, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally will be treated as the owner of the\nunderlying Rentokil Initial ordinary shares that are represented by such Rentokil Initial ADSs. Accordingly,\ndeposits or withdrawals of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares in exchange for Rentokil Initial ADSs will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax. For purposes of this discussion under \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences\u201d, Rentokil Initial ADSs and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares will be referred to as \u201cRentokil\nInitial shares.\u201d\nUnder Section 367(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, special rules may apply to a U.S.\nHolder that actually or constructively owns 5% or more, by vote or value, of the issued and outstanding\nstock of Rentokil Initial immediately after the completion of the transaction. Any such U.S. Holder is urged to\nconsult his, her or its tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction with\nregard to such U.S. Holder\u2019s particular circumstances.\nBased on the composition of Rentokil Initial\u2019s current gross assets and income and the manner in which\nRentokil Initial expects to operate its business in future years, Rentokil Initial believes, and the following\ndiscussion assumes, that Rentokil Initial will not be classified as a passive foreign investment company (a\n\u201cPFIC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its current taxable year and does not expect to be so\nclassified in the foreseeable future. The tests to determine whether a company is a PFIC apply annually and a\ncompany\u2019s status can change depending, among other things, on changes in the composition and relative\nvalue of its gross receipts and assets, changes in its operations and changes in the market value of its stock.\nAccordingly, Rentokil Initial can provide no assurance that it will not be a PFIC for its current taxable year\nand can provide no assurance that it will not become a PFIC in any future taxable year. If Rentokil Initial were\nto be a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owned Rentokil Initial shares, such U.S. Holder\ngenerally would be subject, in that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years (whether or not Rentokil\nInitial continued to be a PFIC), to materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including that\ngain from the sale or other disposition of Rentokil Initial shares as well as certain distributions on Rentokil\nInitial shares would be subject to tax at the highest ordinary income tax rates and an interest charge and U.S.\nHolders would be subject to additional information reporting requirements. U.S. Holders should consult their\nown tax advisors as to the potential application of the PFIC rules.\nTax Residence of Rentokil Initial\nA corporation organized under non-U.S. law, such as Rentokil Initial, is generally treated as a foreign\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under Section 7874 of the Code, a corporation otherwise\ntreated as a foreign corporation may be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or\nmay be subject to certain other adverse tax consequences) if it acquires, directly or indirectly, substantially\nall of the assets held, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. corporation. These rules apply only if certain conditions\nare met, including that the former shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by reason of their\nownership of shares of that U.S. corporation, more than a specified percentage of the shares of the acquiring\nforeign corporation. Based on the percentage of the Rentokil Initial shares to be received by shareholders of\nTerminix in the transaction, Rentokil Initial does not expect these conditions to be met and thus Rentokil\nInitial does not expect Rentokil Initial\u2019s indirect acquisition of Terminix to cause Rentokil Initial to be treated\nas a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise to be subject to Section 7874 of the\nCode. However, the ownership of Rentokil Initial for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code must be finally\ndetermined after the completion of the transaction, by which time there could be adverse changes to the\nrelevant facts and circumstances. If Rentokil Initial were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes or otherwise to be subject to Section 7874 of the Code, Rentokil Initial and its\nsubsidiaries could be subject to substantial additional U.S. tax liability, its non-U.S. shareholders could be\nsubject to U.S. withholding tax on any dividends and its U.S. shareholders could be subject to a higher rate\nof tax on any dividends. This discussion under \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\u201d assumes\nthat Rentokil Initial will not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and has not\notherwise been nor will be subject to Section 7874 of the Code.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of the Transaction\nThe Transaction\nThe obligation of Terminix to complete the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from\nWachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to Terminix, or Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, counsel to\n123 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRentokil Initial, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and\nassumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the first merger and the second merger, taken together\nas an integrated transaction, will qualify (A) as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the\nCode and (B) for an exception to the general rule of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code. This opinion will be based\non certain assumptions, representations and warranties and covenants, including those contained in the\nmerger agreement and in tax representation letters provided by Rentokil Initial (on behalf of itself, Bidco,\nMerger Sub I and Merger Sub II) and Terminix. If any of these assumptions, representations and warranties\nor covenants underlying the tax opinion described above is or becomes incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate or\nis violated, the validity of, and the conclusions reached in, such tax opinion may be affected or jeopardized,\nand the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction could differ materially from those discussed\nbelow. In addition, the opinion will be subject to certain qualifications and limitations as set forth therein.\nMoreover, the opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts, and neither Rentokil Initial nor Terminix\nintends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the transaction.\nConsequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court will not sustain, a\nposition contrary to any of the conclusions set forth in such opinion or the tax consequences described in\nthe discussion below. In particular, if the transaction does not qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, the transaction would be treated as a fully taxable transaction for such purposes, in\nwhich case, a U.S. Holder would be required to recognize any gain or loss on its exchange of shares of\nTerminix common stock for the merger consideration. If the transaction does qualify as a reorganization but\ndoes not qualify for an exception to the general rule of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, a U.S. Holder would be\nrequired to recognize the full amount of any gain, but not loss, on its exchange of shares of Terminix common\nstock for the merger consideration. In certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder could be subject to U.S.\nfederal income and/or withholding tax on its exchange of Terminix common stock for the merger\nconsideration if the transaction does not qualify as a reorganization.\nOn the basis of the opinion described above that the transaction will be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and will qualify for an exception to the general rule of Section\n367(a)(1) of the Code, the following discussion under \u201cTax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Terminix\nCommon Stock of the Transaction\u201d and \u201cTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of Terminix Common Stock\nof the Transaction\u201d describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S.\nHolders and Non-U.S. Holders of Terminix common stock.\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Terminix Common Stock of the Transaction\nA U.S. Holder (assuming, in the case of any such U.S. Holder that would be treated as a \u201cfive-percent\ntransferee shareholder\u201d  (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Rentokil\nInitial following the transaction, that such U.S. Holder enters into a five-year gain recognition agreement in\nthe form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8):\nthat exchanges its shares of Terminix common stock solely for Rentokil Initial shares in the\ntransaction will generally not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except\nin respect of cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any\u037e\nthat exchanges its shares of Terminix common stock solely for cash in the transaction will generally\nrecognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash\n(excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any) received by such U.S.\nHolder in the transaction and such U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of Terminix common stock\nexchanged\u037e and\nthat exchanges its shares of Terminix common stock for a combination of Rentokil Initial shares and\ncash in the transaction will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of:\n(i) the amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any)\nreceived by such U.S. Holder in the transaction\u037e and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the\namount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any) plus the\nfair market value of the Rentokil Initial shares (including any fractional Rentokil Initial shares deemed\nreceived) received by such U.S. Holder in exchange for its shares of Terminix common stock in the\ntransaction, over (b) such U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of Terminix common stock exchanged.\n124 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA U.S. Holder\u2019s basis in its Terminix common stock will generally be equal to the amount paid for such stock.\nSubject to the discussion below regarding potential dividend treatment, any such gain or loss will generally\nbe capital gain or loss. Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the\neffective time, the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the surrendered shares of Terminix common\nstock exceeds one year. A non-corporate U.S. Holder\u2019s long-term capital gain may be taxed at lower rates.\nDeductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations.\nIn certain circumstances, cash consideration received in a transaction otherwise qualifying as a\nreorganization may be characterized as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes rather than capital\ngain where the payment of such cash consideration has the effect of a distribution of a dividend. Whether\nthe payment of such consideration has such effect is generally determined by treating the cash as if it were\nthe proceeds of a hypothetical redemption by the acquirer (or its parent) of additional share consideration\ndeemed issued in the acquisition. If the receipt of cash in such deemed redemption would be treated as a\ndistribution to the U.S. Holder with respect to Rentokil Initial under the tests set forth in Section 302 of the\nCode, the gain recognized pursuant to the transaction by such U.S. Holder would be treated as dividend\nincome to the extent of such U.S. Holder\u2019s ratable share of the accumulated earnings and profits of Terminix\nas calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS has ruled that gain is generally not\nrecharacterized as a dividend under this rule in the case of an exchanging shareholder in a public corporation\nwhose relative stock interest is minimal and who exercises no control with respect to corporate affairs. Based\non this and other applicable legal authority, and on the relevant facts (including the relative amount of the\ncash component of the merger consideration), the cash consideration received by Terminix stockholders in\nthe transaction is generally not expected to be treated as a dividend for such exchanging shareholders.\nHowever, these rules are complex and because the possibility of dividend treatment depends upon each U.S.\nHolder\u2019s particular circumstances, including the application of constructive ownership rules, U.S. Holders\nshould consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules to them.\nThe aggregate tax basis of the Rentokil Initial shares a U.S. Holder receives in the transaction (including any\nfractional Rentokil Initial shares deemed received) will generally be the same as such U.S. Holder\u2019s aggregate\ntax basis in its shares of Terminix common stock surrendered in exchange therefor, decreased by the amount\nof cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any), if any, such U.S. Holder\nreceives and increased by the amount of gain (excluding any gain recognized with respect to cash received\nin lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any), if any, such U.S. Holder recognizes in the transaction. The\nholding period of the Rentokil Initial shares received by a U.S. Holder in the transaction will include such\nU.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of Terminix common stock surrendered in exchange therefor.\nIn the case of a U.S. Holder who holds shares of Terminix common stock with differing tax bases and/or\nholding periods, which generally occurs when blocks of shares are purchased at different times or at\ndifferent prices, the preceding rules must be applied separately to each identifiable block of shares of\nTerminix common stock, and such U.S. Holder may not offset a loss realized on one block of the shares\nagainst gain recognized on another block of the shares.\nA U.S. Holder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional Rentokil Initial share in the transaction generally will\nbe treated as having received such fractional share in the transaction and then as having received cash in\nexchange for such fractional Rentokil Initial share. Gain or loss generally will be recognized based on the\ndifference between the amount of cash received in lieu of the fractional Rentokil Initial share and the portion\nof the U.S. Holder\u2019s aggregate tax basis in the shares of Terminix common stock surrendered allocable to the\nfractional Rentokil Initial share. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, which will be\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for the shares of Terminix common stock is more than one\nyear on the closing date of the transaction. A non-corporate U.S. Holder\u2019s long-term capital gain may be\ntaxed at lower rates. Deductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations.\nTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of Terminix Common Stock of the Transaction\nIn general, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to a Non-U.S. Holder that exchanges its shares of\nTerminix common stock for Rentokil Initial shares, cash or a combination of Rentokil Initial shares and\n125 \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncash in the transaction will be the same as those described above for a U.S. Holder, except that a Non-U.S.\nHolder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding or income tax on any gain recognized in\nconnection with the transaction unless:\nthe gain (if any) is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s conduct of a U.S. trade or\nbusiness (and, where a tax treaty applies, is attributable to the Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. permanent\nestablishment or fixed base in the United States), in which case such gain would be taxed on a net\nincome basis in the same manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. person (and, if such Non-\nU.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Non-U.S. Holder may be\nsubject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty)\u037e\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual present in the United States for at least 183 days during the\ntaxable year of disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which case such Non-U.S.\nHolder would generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on the amount by\nwhich such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s capital gains allocable to U.S. sources, including gain from the\ndisposition pursuant to the transaction, exceed any capital losses allocable to U.S. sources, except\nas otherwise required by an applicable income tax treaty\u037e or\nTerminix is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d), as defined in\nSection 897 of the Code at any time within the five-year period preceding the transaction and\ncertain other conditions are satisfied. Terminix believes that, as of the effective time of the\ntransaction, Terminix will not have been a USRPHC at any time within the five-year period ending\non the date thereof.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders of Rentokil Initial Shares\nDividends\nThe gross amount of any distribution of cash with respect to Rentokil Initial shares will be included in a U.S.\nHolder\u2019s gross income as a dividend to the extent of Rentokil Initial\u2019s current or accumulated earnings and\nprofits as determined under U.S. federal income tax laws. Rentokil Initial does not expect to maintain\ncalculations of earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, a U.S. Holder should\nexpect that any such distribution will generally be treated as a dividend from foreign sources when actually\nor constructively received. Dividends generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction\ngenerally available to U.S. corporations. Dividends received from a \u201cqualified foreign corporation\u201d by\neligible non-corporate U.S. Holders that satisfy a minimum holding period and certain other requirements\ngenerally will be taxed at the preferential rate applicable to qualified dividend income. Rentokil Initial will be\ntreated as a qualified foreign corporation if its shares or ADSs are readily tradable on an established\nsecurities market in the United States or Rentokil Initial qualifies for comprehensive benefits under the U.S.-\nUK income tax treaty and Rentokil Initial has not become and does not become a \u201csurrogate foreign\ncorporation\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes after December 22, 2017 and, in each case, Rentokil Initial\nis not a PFIC for either the taxable year of distribution or the preceding taxable year. U.S. Treasury guidance\nindicates that shares listed on the NYSE will be considered readily tradable on an established securities\nmarket in the United States. There can be no assurance, however, that Rentokil Initial shares will be\nconsidered readily tradable on an established securities market in future years. Rentokil Initial does not\nbelieve that it is a surrogate foreign corporation but can provide no assurance that it is not a surrogate\nforeign corporation and can provide no assurance that it will not become a surrogate foreign corporation.\nDividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be included in income in a U.S. dollar amount based\non the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend is includible in the U.S. Holder\u2019s income, whether or\nnot the currency is converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in the non-U.S. currency\nwill equal the U.S. dollar amount included in income. Any gain or loss realized on a subsequent conversion\nor other disposition of the non-U.S. currency for a different U.S. dollar amount generally will be U.S. source\nordinary income or loss. If dividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars are converted into U.S.\ndollars on the day they are received, a U.S. Holder generally will not be required to recognize foreign\ncurrency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income.\n126 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nSales or Other Dispositions of Rentokil Initial Shares\nA U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of Rentokil Initial\nshares in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized and the U.S.\nHolder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the disposed Rentokil Initial shares. Any gain or loss generally will be treated\nas arising from U.S. sources and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period\nexceeds one year. A non-corporate U.S. Holder\u2019s long-term capital gain may be taxed at lower rates.\nDeductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIn general, information reporting requirements may apply to the cash payments made to U.S. Holders and\nNon-U.S. Holders in connection with the transaction and in respect of Rentokil Initial shares, unless an\nexemption applies. Backup withholding tax may apply to amounts subject to reporting if the applicable\nstockholder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number, fails to report all interest and\ndividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax returns or otherwise fails to establish an\nexemption to backup withholding. U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders can claim a credit against their U.S.\nfederal income tax liability for the amount of any backup withholding tax and a refund of any excess,\nprovided that all required information is timely provided to the IRS.

Taxation of Disposals of Rentokil Initial Ordinary Shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs\nHolders of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs who are not resident in the UK should not\ngenerally be subject to UK taxation of capital gains on the disposal or deemed disposal of Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs unless they are carrying on a trade, profession or vocation in the\nUK through a branch or agency there (or, in the case of a corporate holder, they are carrying on a trade in the\nUK through a permanent establishment there) in connection with which the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares\nor Rentokil Initial ADSs are used, held or acquired.\nNon-UK tax resident holders may be subject to non-UK taxation on any gain under local law.\nAn individual holder of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs who has been resident for tax\npurposes in the UK but who ceases to be so resident or becomes treated as resident outside the UK for the\npurposes of a double tax treaty for a period of five years or less and who disposes of all or part of his or her\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs during that period may be liable to capital gains tax\non his or her return to the UK, subject to any available exemptions or reliefs.\nB. Taxation of Dividends Received from Rentokil Initial\nRentokil Initial is not required to withhold UK tax when paying a dividend. Holders resident outside the UK\nshould generally not be subject to UK taxation on dividend income unless they are carrying on a trade,\nprofession or vocation through a branch or agency in the UK (or, in the case of a corporate holder, they are\ncarrying on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment there) and the dividends are either a receipt\nof that trade, profession or vocation (or, in the case of a corporate holder, the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares\nor Rentokil Initial ADSs are used by, or held by or for, that UK permanent establishment). Holders resident\noutside the UK should consult their own tax adviser concerning their tax position on dividends received\nfrom Rentokil Initial.\nC. UK Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (Which We Refer to as \u201cSDRT\u201d)\nThe statements in this paragraph C. apply to any holders of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs\nirrespective of their residence, summarize the current position and are intended as a general guide only. Special rules\napply to agreements made by, amongst others, intermediaries.\nConsequences of the transaction\nTerminix stockholders should not be liable to pay any UK stamp duty or SDRT in respect of the issuance of\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs pursuant to the transaction.\nSubsequent transfers of underlying Rentokil Initial ordinary shares on cancellation of Rentokil Initial\nADSs\nThe transfer of underlying Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to holders of Rentokil Initial ADSs in exchange for\nthe cancellation of such Rentokil Initial ADSs should not give rise to a UK stamp duty or SDRT charge.\nSubsequent transfers of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares in other circumstances\nUK stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% (rounded up to the next multiple of \u00a35) of the amount or value of the\nconsideration given is generally payable on a physical instrument transferring Rentokil Initial ordinary\nshares. (A charge to SDRT will also arise on an unconditional agreement to transfer Rentokil Initial ordinary\nshares (at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration payable). However, if within six years\nof the date of the agreement becoming unconditional an instrument of transfer is executed pursuant to the\nagreement, and UK stamp duty is paid on that instrument, any SDRT already paid should be refunded\n(generally, but not necessarily, with interest) provided that a claim for repayment is made, and any\noutstanding liability to SDRT should be cancelled.) An exemption from UK stamp duty is available on an\ninstrument transferring Rentokil Initial ordinary shares where the amount or value of the consideration is\n\u00a31,000 or less, and it is certified on the instrument that the transaction effected by the instrument does not\nform part of a larger transaction or series of transactions for which the aggregate consideration exceeds\n\u00a31,000. The liability to pay UK stamp duty or SDRT is generally satisfied by the purchaser or transferee.\n128 \n(iv) \n(v) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPaperless transfers of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, such as those occurring within CREST, are generally\nliable to SDRT, rather than UK stamp duty, at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration.\nCREST is obliged to collect SDRT on relevant transactions settled within the system. The charge is generally\nborne by the purchaser. Under the CREST system, no UK stamp duty or SDRT should arise on a transfer of\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares into the system unless such a transfer is made (or deemed to be made) for a\nconsideration in money or money\u2019s worth, in which case a liability to SDRT (usually at a rate of 0.5%) will\narise.\nIn cases where Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are transferred to a connected company (or its nominee),\nSDRT (or UK stamp duty) may be chargeable on the higher of (i) the amount or value of the consideration\nand (ii) the market value of the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares held through Clearance Systems or Depositary Receipt Arrangements\nSpecial rules apply where Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are issued or transferred to, or to a nominee or\nagent for, either a person whose business is or includes issuing depositary receipts or a person providing a\nclearance service. SDRT or UK stamp duty may be charged at a rate of 1.5%, with subsequent transfers\nwithin the clearance service or transfers of depositary receipts then being free from SDRT or UK stamp duty.\nHMRC previously accepted that this charge is in breach of EU law so far as it applies to new issues of shares\nor transfers that are an integral part of a capital raising. Following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, such pre-\nexisting EU rights, recognized in litigation, were preserved as a domestic law matter following the end of the\nimplementation period on 31 December 2020 pursuant to provisions of the UK European Union (Withdrawal)\nAct 2018. Accordingly, no SDRT or UK stamp duty is payable upon the issue of Rentokil Initial ordinary\nshares to a clearance service or depositary (or upon the transfer of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to a\nclearance service or depositary where such transfer is integral to the raising of capital by Rentokil Initial).\nHMRC\u2019s published view is that the 1.5% SDRT or UK stamp duty charge continued to apply to other\ntransfers of shares into a clearance service or depositary receipt arrangement, although this has been\ndisputed. Further litigation indicates that certain transfers of legal title to clearance services in connection\nwith listing, but not integral to a new issue, are also not chargeable. In view of the continuing uncertainty,\nspecific professional advice should be sought before incurring a 1.5% UK stamp duty or SDRT charge in any\ncircumstances.\nSubsequent transfers of Rentokil Initial ADSs\nProvided there is no written instrument of transfer, transfers of the Rentokil Initial ADSs for consideration\nshould not attract a charge to UK stamp duty. Paperless transfers of Rentokil Initial ADSs held by DTC\nshould not incur an SDRT charge.\n129 \n",

The compensation\nproposal gives Terminix stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related\ncompensation of Terminix\u2019s named executive officers.\nAccordingly, Terminix is asking Terminix stockholders to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the following\nresolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Terminix\u2019s named executive\nofficers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transaction, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of\nRegulation S-K under the heading \u201cThe Merger Proposal -  Interests of Terminix\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Transaction -  Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Terminix\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger,\u201d including the associated narrative\ndiscussion and the agreements, plans, arrangements or understandings pursuant to which such\ncompensation may be paid or become payable, are hereby APPROVED.\u201d\nThe vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger\nagreement. Accordingly, if you are a Terminix stockholder, you may vote to approve the merger proposal, and\nvote not to approve the compensation proposal, and vice versa. The vote on the compensation proposal is\nadvisory and non-binding. As a result, if the transaction is completed, the merger-related compensation may\nbe paid to Terminix\u2019s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of the\ncompensation agreements and arrangements even if Terminix stockholders do not approve the compensation\nproposal.\nThe Terminix board of directors unanimously recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal.\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of\nTerminix common stock present in person (including virtually via the Internet) or represented by proxy at the\nTerminix special meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve the compensation proposal, assuming a\nquorum is present. A broker non-vote or a Terminix stockholder\u2019s failure to return or submit a proxy and to\nattend the Terminix special meeting will have no effect on the compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is\npresent), but the failure of any shares present or represented at the Terminix special meeting and entitled to\nvote on the proposal to vote will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the compensation proposal.\nIF YOU ARE A TERMINIX STOCKHOLDER, THE TERMINIX BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY\nRECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE \u201cFOR\u201d THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 2).\n130",

            "text": "Closing and Effectiveness of the Transaction\nUnless otherwise mutually agreed to by Terminix and Rentokil Initial, the closing of the transaction will take\nplace at 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the fifth business day following the satisfaction or, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law, waiver of the conditions to the completion of the transaction (other than\nconditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the transaction, but subject to the\nsatisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of such conditions by the party or parties\nentitled to the benefit thereof at the closing of the transaction) described under the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the Transaction\u201d\nbeginning on page 141 or, if such date would fall on or after the end date, then on the business day\nimmediately preceding the end date.\nAt the closing, the parties will file certificates of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware\nto effectuate the transaction. The first merger will become effective when the first certificate of merger has\nbeen duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at a later time as agreed by Terminix\nand Rentokil Initial as specified in such certificate of merger. The second merger will become effective when\nthe second certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at\na later time as agreed by Terminix and Rentokil Initial as specified in such certificate of merger. At the second\neffective time, all of the rights, powers, privileges and franchises of Terminix and Merger Sub II and all of the\nobligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of Terminix and Merger Sub II will vest in the surviving\ncompany.\nTerminix and Rentokil Initial expect to complete the transaction on October 12, 2022, assuming the merger\nproposal is approved by Terminix stockholders on October 6, 2022 and the other conditions to closing\n(described under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - \nConditions to Completion of the Transaction\u201d beginning on page 141) are satisfied (including approval of\nthe Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals by Rentokil Initial shareholders on October 6, 2022).\nMerger Consideration\nAt the first effective time, by virtue of the first merger and without any action on the part of the parties to the\nmerger agreement or any Terminix stockholder, each share of Terminix common stock (other than excluded\nshares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive (and, immediately following such conversion,\nthose shares of Terminix common stock will be automatically cancelled and cease to exist (the\n\u201cCancellation\u201d)), at the election of the holders of such shares, either the stock consideration or cash\nconsideration. Any Terminix stockholder who does not make an election will be deemed to have made an\nelection to receive the stock consideration.\nThe total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued and the aggregate amount of cash to be paid under\nthe terms of the merger agreement will not vary as a result of individual election preferences. The Rentokil\nInitial ADSs issued in connection with the transaction will be listed on the NYSE and are expected to trade\nunder the symbol \u201cRTO.\u201d Based on the number of shares of Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares outstanding on August 31, 2022, immediately after completion of the transaction, we expect\nthat former Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the transaction would own Rentokil\nInitial ADSs representing approximately 25.7% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial, and\nRentokil Initial shareholders immediately prior to the transaction would own approximately 74.3% of the\noutstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial.\nThe value of the per share cash consideration and the value of the per share stock consideration as of the\nmeasurement day will be substantially the same. For example, as of July 15, 2022 (which date has been\nselected solely for illustrative purposes), Rentokil Initial\u2019s volume weighted share price was \u00a35.0825\n(expressed in whole pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar\nexchange rate was 1.1855. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS price would be\n$30.13 and, accordingly, subject to certain allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement, as\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Allocation of\nMerger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page 135:\n132 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nthe per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $42.99 which is (A) $11.00, the\nper share cash amount, plus (B) $31.99, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.13, the\nRentokil Initial ADS price as of such date\u037e and\nthe per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4270 (which\nhave an approximate value as of such date of $42.99) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange ratio, plus (B)\n0.3651, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.13, the Rentokil Initial ADS price as\nof such date.\nAs a result, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the per\nshare stock consideration was approximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common stock.\nThe market value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders will fluctuate with the market price of\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares and will not be known at the time that Terminix stockholders vote on the\ntransaction. Based on Rentokil Initial\u2019s five-day average daily volume weighted share price and the five-day\naverage of the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in each case, over the period spanning December 6, 2021 to\nDecember 10, 2021, inclusive, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders was\napproximately $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock. As described in the prior paragraph, based on\nRentokil Initial\u2019s volume weighted average share price and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in\neach case, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders was\napproximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common stock. To further demonstrate how the implied value of\nthe merger consideration may fluctuate over time, we note that as of August 31, 2022 (the latest practicable\ndate prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus), Rentokil Initial\u2019s volume weighted share price was\n\u00a35.2331 (expressed in whole pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-U.S.\nDollar exchange rate was 1.1638. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS price would\nbe $30.45 and, accordingly, subject to certain allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement, as\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fAllocation of\nMerger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d beginning on page 135:\nthe per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $43.33 which is (A) $11.00, the\nper share cash amount, plus (B) $32.33, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.45, the\nRentokil Initial ADS price as of such date\u037e and\nthe per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4231 (which\nhave an approximate value on such date of $43.33) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange ratio, plus (B)\n0.3612, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.45, the Rentokil Initial ADS price as\nof such date.\nAs a result, as of August 31, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the per\nshare stock consideration was approximately $43.33 per share of Terminix common stock.\nThe market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the implied value of the merger consideration, could\nbe greater than, less than or the same as their market price or implied value, as applicable, on the date of this\nproxy statement/prospectus or the date of the Terminix special meeting. Accordingly, you should obtain\ncurrent market quotations for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock before deciding\nhow to vote with respect to the merger proposal. Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock\nare traded on the LSE and the NYSE, under the symbols \u201cRTO\u201d and \u201cTMX,\u201d respectively. The price of\nRentokil Initial ordinary shares is reported in pounds sterling.\nStock Consideration\nThe merger agreement provides that each share of Terminix common stock with respect to which (x) an\nelection to receive the stock consideration (each, a \u201cstock electing share\u201d) has been effectively made and not\nrevoked or lost or (y) an election has not effectively been made prior to the election deadline (each, a \u201cnon-\nelecting share\u201d) will automatically convert at the first effective time into the right to receive a number of\nRentokil Initial ADSs (each representing a beneficial interest in five Rentokil Initial ordinary shares) equal to\n(A) the exchange ratio plus (B) the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of the per share cash amount\nand the Rentokil Initial ADS price.\n133 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nProration.

Such cash amount will be equivalent to the value of the amount of stock\nconsideration owed in excess of the prorated number of Rentokil Initial ADSs, with such stock\nconsideration valued based on the volume weighted average price (in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil Initial\nADSs (measured using the volume weighted average price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares\nmultiplied by the number of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by each Rentokil Initial ADS)\nfor the measurement day.\nCash Consideration\nThe merger agreement provides that each share of Terminix common stock with respect to which an election\nto receive cash consideration (each, a \u201ccash electing share\u201d) has been effectively made and not revoked or\nlost will convert at the first effective time into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, and in\nU.S. dollars (rounded down to the nearest cent) equal to (A) the per share cash amount plus (B) the product\nof the exchange ratio and the Rentokil Initial ADS price.\nProration. Notwithstanding anything contained in the immediately preceding paragraph to the contrary, if\nthe cash consideration is oversubscribed such that:\nthe product of the number of cash electing shares and the cash consideration (such product being\nthe \u201ccash election amount\u201d) exceeds\nthe product of the per share cash amount and the total number of shares of Terminix common stock\n(other than certain excluded shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the first effective\ntime (the \u201cavailable cash election amount\u201d),\nthen each cash electing share shall be converted into a right to receive:\na prorated amount in cash (without interest) in U.S. dollars (rounded down to the nearest cent) (the\n\u201cprorated cash amount\u201d) equal to the product of (1) the cash consideration and (2) a fraction, the\nnumerator of which shall be the available cash election amount and the denominator of which shall be\nthe cash election amount\u037e and\na number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of (1) (A) the\ncash consideration minus (B) the prorated cash amount and (2) the Rentokil Initial ADS price. Such\nnumber of Rentokil Initial ADSs will have a value equivalent to the amount of cash consideration\nowed in excess of the prorated cash amount, and will be valued based on the volume weighted\naverage price (in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil Initial ADSs (measured using the volume weighted average\nprice of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares multiplied by the number of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares\nrepresented by each Rentokil Initial ADS) for the measurement day.\nCash/Stock Election\nAt least 20 business days prior to the anticipated closing date, the form of election will be mailed to all\nrecord holders of Terminix common stock as of September 6, 2022.

adjustments have been made to convert the Terminix group\u2019s balance sheet and\nstatements of operations to Rentokil Initial\u2019s IFRS accounting policies:\nLeases\u202f-\u202fUnder U.S. GAAP, all of Terminix\u2019s real estate leases were classified as operating leases,\nwhere the lease liability is measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments, and the\nright-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset is remeasured as the amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease\nincentives, prepaid/accrued rents, initial direct costs, or impairment. This treatment results in the\nrecognition of rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Under IFRS 16, depreciation\nof the right-of-use asset and interest expense are recognized separately in the statement of profit or\nloss. Accordingly, adjustments have been made to reflect the depreciation of right-of-use assets on\na straight-line basis and the recognition of interest expense on the lease liability under IFRS 16.\nAll of Terminix fleet leases were classified as finance leases under ASC 842. Adjustments have been\nmade to Terminix\u2019s fleet leases to remeasure the ROU assets and liabilities at the prevailing\nincremental borrowing rate (IBR). Additionally, Terminix capitalized short-term fleet leases, low\nvalue fleet leases, and non-lease components under its ASC 842 policy. These components have\nbeen expensed under IFRS 16 to align with Rentokil Initial\u2019s accounting policy.\nAs a result, ROU assets of US$14 million and lease liabilities of US$5 million have been\nderecognized in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 along with the related impact to deferred tax\nliabilities of US$3 million and reduction of retained earnings by US$6 million. Additionally, there\nwas an adjustment of US$3 million to decrease operating expense and an adjustment of US$4\nii) \nwas an adjustment of US$3 million to decrease operating expense and an adjustment of US$4\nmillion to increase finance costs and a related tax benefit of US$0.3 million during the six months\nended June 30, 2022 and an adjustment of US$5 million to decrease operating expense and an\nadjustment of US$8 million to increase finance costs and a related tax benefit of US$1 million during\nthe year ended December 31, 2021.\nShare-based compensation\u202f-\u202fUnder its U.S. GAAP accounting policy, Terminix has valued its\ngraded vesting awards with service-only conditions as a single award and has recorded the share-\nbased compensation expense for these awards using a straight-line method over the vesting period\nfor the entire award. Rentokil Initial\u2019s IFRS accounting policies require that each tranche of a\ngraded vesting award with service-only conditions be valued as a separate award and that the\nshare-based compensation expense be recorded using a straight-line basis over the respective\nvesting period for each separately vesting portion of the award. Adjustments have been made to\nreflect the impact on the grant date fair value and the timing of expense recognition for grants with\nunvested options. These changes resulted in a decrease of share-based compensation within\noperating expenses of US$6 million and a related tax charge of US$1.3 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2022 and a US$2 million decrease within operating expenses and a related tax charge\nof US$0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This also resulted in an adjustment\nbetween retained earnings and share premium of US$6 million and a related deferred tax benefit of\nUS$1 million in the balance sheet.\n175 \niii) \niv) \nv) \nvi) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\u202f(Continued)\nContingent liabilities and provisions\u202f-\u202fUnder U.S. GAAP, Terminix has not discounted its\nrecognized contingent liabilities as the timing of the settlement of these accrued liabilities are not\nfixed or readily determinable. IFRS requires provisions to be discounted if the effect of the time\nvalue of money is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of\nthe time value of money and risks specific to the liability that have not been reflected in the best\nestimate of the expenditure.\nAs a result, provisions of US$20 million and the related insurance receivables of US$7 million have\nbeen reduced in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, along with a related deferred tax charge of\nUS$4 million, resulting from the effect of the time value of money. The statement of profit or loss for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2022 reflects a US$2 million reduction to operating expenses and a\nUS$3 million increase to finance costs and a related tax charge of US$0.3 million. The statement of\nprofit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a US$4 million reduction to operating\nexpenses and a US$4 million increase to finance costs and a related tax charge of US$0.1 million.\nFinancial Instruments\u202f-\u202fUnder its U.S. GAAP policy, Terminix capitalized financing costs associated\nwith its debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470. These financing costs under IFRS\nstandards are required to be expensed as incurred. As a result, debt financing costs capitalized in\nOther Receivables -LT of US$2 million and in Bank and other long-term borrowings of US$4 million\nwere derecognized in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 along with a related deferred tax benefit\nof US$2 million.\nIn addition, under its U.S. GAAP policy, Terminix retained the accumulated foreign currency reserve\nrelated to a net investment hedge that was terminated during the six months ended June 30, 2022 as\nthe foreign entity associated with the hedge was not substantially liquidated. Under IFRS, the\nforeign exchange reserve shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss upon disposal or partial\ndisposal of the foreign operation. As a result, a portion of the foreign exchange reserve was\nreleased into statement of profit or loss, resulting in a $1 million increase in other reserves in the\nbalance sheet as of June 30, 2022.\nThe statement of profit or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reflects a US$1 million\nreduction to operating expenses and a related tax charge of US$0.3 million for these adjustments.\nThe statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a US$2 million\nreduction to operating expenses and a related tax charge of US$0.5 million.\nCapitalized Software\u202f-\u202fcloud computing costs\u202f-\u202fTerminix incurred and capitalized implementation\ncosts related to cloud computing arrangements associated with the development of developing a\nnew customer service platform to replace its legacy operating systems. Under its U.S. GAAP\naccounting policies, the costs incurred for the development of the platform were classified within\nPrepaid Expenses on Terminix\u2019s statement of financial position.\nThe costs incurred by Terminix for the development of the customer platform are not eligible for\nrecognition as capitalized assets under Rentokil Initial\u2019s IFRS accounting policies and instead the\narrangement will be treated as a service agreement. Furthermore, the implementation costs are\ndistinct from the service agreements in place and should be expensed as incurred. Therefore, US$54\nmillion of capitalized development costs were derecognized from the balance sheet as of June 30,\n2022 along with a related deferred tax benefit of US$15 million and a retained earnings impact of\nUS$32 million. The statement of profit or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reflects a\nUS$10 million increase to operating expenses and a related tax benefit of US$3 million. The\nstatement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a US$19 million increase to\noperating expenses and a related tax benefit of US$6 million.\nTermite damage claims\u202f-\u202fUnder Terminix\u2019s U.S. GAAP accounting policies, Terminix has recorded\ncertain liabilities with respect to existing or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings,\nincluding litigated termite damage claims up to one year after the balance sheet date when amounts\nare both probable and reasonably estimable. A provision for litigated claims is recorded as claims\nare filed, while the provision for non-litigated claims is based on known filed claims plus\n176 \nvii) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\u202f(Continued)\nthose expected to arise for active customers within the contractually stated claims notification\nperiod. In contrast, under Rentokil Initial\u2019s IFRS accounting policy, its assessment of probable\nfuture cash outflows arising from claims relating to the entire pool of existing contracts is based on\nhistorical claim trends and costs for the total estimated period a customer is expected to be\nretained. This change in methodology pursuant to Rentokil Initial\u2019s IFRS accounting policy results\nin an increase in the provision for both litigated and non-litigated claims.\nAccordingly, Rentokil Initial has recognised a further provision of US$250 million as of June 30,\n2022, which primarily relates to non-litigated claims, with an increase to current provisions for\nliabilities and charges of US$6 million and an increase to non-current provisions for liabilities and\ncharges of US$244 million representing Rentokil Initial\u2019s estimate of probable claims expected to\narise over the entire duration of the customer relationship, along with a deferred tax benefit of\nUS$67 million. The statement of profit or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reflects a\nUS$42 million decrease in expense, a US$1 million increase in finance cost and a related tax charge\nof US$11 million, taking account of the position as of December 31, 2021. The statement of profit or\nloss for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a US$24 million increase in expense, and a\nrelated tax benefit of US$6 million, taking account of the position as of December 31, 2020.\nInterim Advertising Costs\u202f-\u202fUnder U.S. GAAP, Terminix has elected for interim reporting to defer\nadvertising costs within a fiscal year where the benefits of the expenditure extend beyond the\ninterim period in which the expenditure was made. IFRS requires advertising and marketing costs to\nbe expense as incurred unless services are paid in advance and not immediately available (i.e.,\nprepaid expenses). To align Terminix\u2019s existing U.S. GAAP policy to those of Rentokil Initial, an\nadjustment of US$7 million has been made to reduce prepaid expenses within trade and other\nreceivables on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, along with a related deferred tax charge of\nUS$2 million, to reflect the expense recognition of marketing services received and incurred.\nThe statement of profit or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reflects a US$7 million\nincrease to operating expenses and a related tax charge of US$2 million. No adjustment was\nrequired for the year ended 31 December 2021.\nDebt refinancing\nOn February 25, 2022, Rentokil Initial entered into a US$2,700 million credit facility consisting of (i) \u201cFacility\nA,\u201d a bridge facility having an aggregate principal amount of US$2,000 million and (ii) \u201cFacility B,\u201d a term\nfacility having an aggregate principal amount of US$700 million (\u00a3575 million) (collectively, the Financing\nCommitments), which have been provided by a syndicate of banks. Facility A had an original maturity date of\nAugust 25, 2023. Facility B will mature on the third anniversary of the date of the first utilization.\nOn June 27, 2022, Rentokil Initial issued senior unsecured notes for \u20ac850 million (\u00a3732 million), \u20ac600 million\n(\u00a3516 million) and \u00a3400 million (collectively, \u201cthe New Senior Notes\u201d), maturing on June 27, 2027, June 27,\n2030 and June 27, 2032, respectively. The New Senior Notes were issued in part to replace Facility A with\nlonger term financing with the proceeds being received and held on deposit as at June 30, 2022, pending\ncompletion of the transaction. On June 30, 2022, Rentokil Initial cancelled Facility A. Accordingly, Facility A\nhas been excluded from the debt refinancing adjustments below.\nThe proceeds of the Facility B and the New Senior Notes are to be used to pay the merger consideration,\ncertain costs and expenses in connection therewith and for the refinancing of indebtedness of Terminix and\nits subsidiaries. On the basis that the amount can only be drawn in a single tranche, Rentokil Initial has\nassumed the full amount of Facility B will be drawn down with respect to the Transaction, which is reflected\nin the debt refinancing adjustments below. Upon repayment of the outstanding Terminix term loan facility,\nthe related interest rate swap will be terminated with a settlement of US$29 million (\u00a324 million) expected to\nbe received from the counterparty based on the fair value as of June 30, 2022.\n177 \n(i) \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\u202f(Continued)\nCurrent and non-current bank and other borrowings and financial derivatives have been adjusted as follows\nbased on the sources of funding described above:\nDebt\nrefinancing \nadjustments \n\u00a3m\nProceeds from Facility B\n575\nTotal borrowings\n575\nDebt issuance costs to be recognized\n(1\nTotal cash proceeds, net of debt issuance costs\n574\nRepayment of outstanding Terminix term loan facility and notes\n(616\nRelease of historical Terminix unamortized debt issuance costs of \u00a31 million and fair value \nadjustments of \u00a348 million\n(47\nNet change in debt\n(89\nPresented as:\nCurrent portion of financial derivatives\n7\nNon-current portion of financial derivatives\n17\nCurrent portion of debt adjustment\n-\nNon-current portion of debt adjustment\n(113\nThe repayment of the outstanding Terminix term loan facility and notes includes the \u00a317 million (of the\ntotal \u00a365 million adjustment) adjustment recorded to debt (Note 4b(iii)), in order to increase the\nhistorical book value to the par value to be repaid, partially offset by expected proceeds from the\nsettlement of interest rate swaps of US$29 million (\u00a324 million).\nThe fair value adjustments to be released represents the excess of the fair value of debt recorded (Note\n4b(iii)) over the par value to be repaid.\nProceeds from the credit facility are planned to be used for repayment of outstanding Terminix term loan\nfacility and notes, payments for cash consideration, transaction costs and other costs associated with the\nMerger.\nIn conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding Terminix notes, a termination fee of US$58 million (\u00a348\nmillion) will be paid on the early settlement made by Rentokil Initial. This has been presented in the pro forma\nbalance sheet as of June 30, 2022 as a reduction to cash and cash equivalents. The total cash settlement,\nincluding the termination fee, approximates the fair value recognized on acquisition of Terminix, and therefore\na nil amount has been recorded in the pro forma statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nThe interest rate for loans borrowed pursuant to the Facility B is a benchmark rate based on the secured\novernight financing rate for U.S.

Rentokil Initial Shares.\nThe portion of the fair value of Terminix\u2019s equity awards attributable to pre-combination service that will\nbe assumed by Rentokil Initial upon the closing amounts to \u00a320 million, of which \u00a36 million relates to\nfully vested and outstanding awards that will be cash settled and has been included in cash\nconsideration. The estimated portion of the Rentokil Initial replacement award attributable to post-\ncombination services resulted in additional compensation expense of \u00a35 million (see note 4h).\nThe total share consideration for each share of Terminix common stock was estimated using the closing\nprice of Rentokil Initial Plc as of August 31, 2022, and the number of fully diluted shares outstanding as\nof August 31, 2022, which was the last practicable date prior to the issuance of this Pro Forma Financial\nInformation. The proportion of the Terminix Stock Options, Terminix Restricted Stock Unit Awards and\nTerminix Performance Stock Unit Awards vesting prior to June 30, 2022, were also included within the\ntotal share consideration. The actual purchase consideration will be determined upon the closing.\nThe total cash consideration was calculated using the shares of Terminix common stock outstanding as\nof August 31, 2022, multiplied by the US$11 due to Terminix stockholders for each share of Terminix\ncommon stock as set out in the merger agreement. The cash consideration also includes \u00a36 million for\nfully vested and outstanding equity awards that will be cash settled as described in note 4h.\nTo determine the preliminary purchase consideration of \u00a34,480 million, Rentokil Initial\u2019s closing share price\non August 31, 2022 of \u00a35.21 has been used. The actual purchase price and exchange rate will fluctuate\nbetween August 31, 2022 and the closing date of the transaction.

The fair value\nof the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares underlying the Rentokil Initial ADSs to be delivered as part of the\nconsideration transferred will be measured, at the closing, based on the number of Terminix shares\noutstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio of 1.0619 and the then-current market price of Rentokil Initial\nordinary shares. This requirement will likely result in a per share equity component different from the \u00a35.21\nper share closing price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares on August 31, 2022 that is assumed in the Pro\nForma Financial Information, and that difference may be material.\nPreliminary purchase consideration allocation\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the preliminary purchase consideration is allocated to the\nTerminix group\u2019s assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The preliminary allocation\nincluded in the Pro Forma Financial Information below has been developed based on preliminary estimates of\nfair value using the historical financial statements of the Terminix group as of June 30, 2022 and is therefore\nsubject to change.\nThe preliminary allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of August 31, 2022 is\nestimated as follows:\nAllocation of preliminary purchase consideration \n(in \u00a3 m):\nBook\nvalue\nFair value \nadjustment\nNotes\nFair\nvalue\nEstimated fair value of assets acquired:\nIntangible assets, excluding goodwill\n877\n875\n4b(i\n1,752\nGoodwill\n1,730\n2,080\n4b(ii\n3,810\nProperty, plant and equipment\n42\n-\n42\nRight of use assets\n143\n-\n143\nCash and cash equivalents\n301\n-\n301\nOther assets\n480\n-\n480\nEstimated fair values of liabilities assumed:\nDebt\n(821\n(65\n4b(iii\n(886\nProvisions\n(387\n(6\n4b(iv\n(393\nDeferred tax liability\n(255\n(217\n4b(v\n(472\nOther liabilities\n(297\n-\n(297\nTotal allocation\n1,813\n2,667\n4,480\nExcept as discussed below, the carrying value of Terminix\u2019s assets and liabilities are considered to\napproximate their fair values.\nThe fair value of Terminix\u2019s intangible assets is estimated to be \u00a31,752 million, or a net increase of\n\u00a3875 million compared to a carrying value of \u00a3877 million.

For the Terminix named executive officers,\nthe aggregate cash payments would be \u00a39 million, the accelerated equity payments would be \u00a310 million, and\nthe value of other benefits would be \u00a34 million. The effects of the aggregate cash payments and other\nbenefits of \u00a313 million resulting from the Terminix management agreements have been reflected within\noperating expenses for the year end December 31, 2021 as part of the total transaction adjustments of \u00a3154\nmillion, with a corresponding tax impact of \u00a34 million, which is included in the total adjustment to income tax\nexpense of \u00a320 million along with the tax effect of the increase in amortization expense of \u00a315 million in note\n4b(i) and the tax effect of the replacement awards of \u00a31 million in note 4h. These one-off costs will not have a\ncontinuing impact on the results of the combined company. The costs have been shown as a reduction to\ncash and cash equivalents in the pro forma balance sheet. The effect of the equity component of these\narrangements has been included in the adjustment at note 4h.\nWere all Terminix named executive officers terminated within the window of time provided in the respective\nmanagement agreements, Rentokil Initial would be required to make the following payments in total:\n(in \u00a3 m)\nCash\n9\nEquity\n10\nOther benefits\n4\nTotal\n23\nDisposal of the UK and Norway businesses\nOn June 1, 2022, in order to satisfy closing conditions of the proposed acquisition by Rentokil Initial,\nTerminix divested its international pest management businesses in the UK and Norway (the \u201cDivestment\u201d).\nThe pro forma balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 excludes the balances of the UK and Norway business\nfollowing the Divestment but the pro forma profit or loss statement includes the financial results of these\nbusinesses up to the date of the Divestment and were not excluded on the basis of materiality.

            "text": "Change of Control and Takeovers\nRentokil Initial is subject to the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, which governs the conduct of mergers\nand takeovers in the UK.\nAn English public limited company such as Rentokil Initial may be acquired in a number of ways, including\nby means of a scheme of arrangement (as defined below) between the company and its shareholders or by\nmeans of a takeover offer.\nA scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure under the UK Companies Act 2006 pursuant to which the\nEnglish courts may approve an arrangement between an English company and some or all of its\nshareholders. In a scheme of arrangement, the company would make an initial application to the court to\nconvene a meeting or meetings of its shareholders at which a majority in number of shareholders\nrepresenting 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders present and voting either in person or by proxy at\nthe meeting must agree to the arrangement by which they will sell their shares in exchange for the\nconsideration being offered by the bidder. If the shareholders so agree, the company will return to court to\nrequest the court to sanction the arrangement. Upon such a scheme of arrangement becoming effective in\naccordance with its terms and the UK Companies Act 2006, it will bind the company and such shareholders.\nA takeover offer is an offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of a company (other than shares which at\nthe date of the offer are already held by the bidder). Under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers and in\norder to squeeze out dissenting shareholders, the offer must be made on identical terms to all holders of\nshares to which the offer relates. If the bidder, by virtue of acceptances of the offer, acquires or contracts to\nacquire not less than 90% in value of the shares to which the offer relates representing not less than 90% of\nthe voting rights attached to the shares, the UK Companies Act 2006 allows the bidder to give notice to any\nnon-accepting shareholder that the bidder intends to acquire his, her or its shares through a compulsory\nacquisition (also referred to as a squeeze-out), and the shares of such non-accepting shareholders will be\nacquired by the bidder six weeks later on the same terms as the offer, unless the shareholder objects to the\nEnglish court and the court enters an order that the bidder is not entitled to acquire the shares or specifying\nterms of the acquisition different to those of the offer.\nThe UK Companies Act 2006 permits a scheme of arrangement or takeover offer to be made relating only to a\nparticular class or classes of a company\u2019s shares.\nAs Rentokil Initial is a UK premium listed company, if it were subject to a takeover bid and the takeover were\nstructured as a contractual takeover offer, under the FCA\u2019s Listing Rules a bidder would have to, by virtue of\nits shareholdings and acceptances of its takeover offer, acquire or agree to acquire shares carrying 75% of\nthe voting rights of Rentokil Initial before it could cancel Rentokil Initial\u2019s listing on the main market of the\nLSE.\nWhere the takeover is by way of a scheme of arrangement, the FCA\u2019s Listing Rules do not impose any\nadditional rules as regards shareholder approval or the level of acceptances required before Rentokil Initial\ncould be delisted, as the scheme procedure provides sufficient protection for shareholders.\nThere are no provisions in Rentokil Initial\u2019s articles of association that would have an effect of delaying,\ndeferring or preventing a takeover by, or change of control of, Rentokil Initial.\n198 TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nUnder English law, Rentokil Initial\u2019s directors have a statutory and fiduciary duty to take only those actions\nthat are in the interests of Rentokil Initial as a whole. Generally, anti-takeover measures are not actions that\nfall within this category.\nHowever, under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, if an acquisition of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares\nincreases the aggregate holding of an acquirer and persons acting in concert with the acquirer (i.e., persons\nwho, pursuant to an agreement or understanding, cooperate to obtain or consolidate control of a company or\nto frustrate the successful outcome of an offer for a company) to shares carrying 30% or more of the voting\nrights in Rentokil Initial, the acquirer and, depending on the circumstances, its concert parties, would be\nrequired (except with the consent of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers) to make a cash offer for the\noutstanding Rentokil Initial ordinary shares at a price not less than the highest price paid for the Rentokil\nInitial ordinary shares by the acquirer or its concert parties during the previous 12 months. This requirement\nwould also be triggered by any acquisition of shares by a person holding (together with its concert parties)\nshares carrying between 30% and 50% of the voting rights in Rentokil Initial if the effect of such acquisition\nwere to increase that person\u2019s percentage of the voting rights.",

It may decide to sell what Rentokil Initial\ndistributed and distribute the net proceeds, in the same way as it does with cash. Or, it may decide to hold\nwhat Rentokil Initial distributed, in which case Rentokil Initial ADSs will also represent the newly distributed\nproperty. However, the depositary bank is not required to distribute any securities (other than Rentokil Initial\nADSs) to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders unless it receives satisfactory assurances from Rentokil Initial that it\nis legal to make that distribution. The depositary bank may sell a portion of the distributed securities or\nproperty sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in connection with that distribution and to pay any tax or\nother governmental charge to which such distribution is subject. U.S. securities laws may restrict the ability\nof the depositary bank to distribute securities to all or certain Rentokil Initial ADS Holders, and the securities\ndistributed may be subject to restrictions on transfer.\nThe depositary bank is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution\navailable to any Rentokil Initial ADS Holders. Rentokil Initial has no obligation to register Rentokil Initial\nADSs, Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, rights or other securities under the U.S. Securities Act. Rentokil Initial\nalso has no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of Rentokil Initial ADSs, Rentokil\nInitial ordinary shares, rights or anything else to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders.

However, the\nCompanies Act 2006 requires that a shareholder of a\ncompany who brings a derivative claim or seeks to\ncontinue a claim as a derivative claim must apply to\nthe courts of England and Wales for permission to\ncontinue the claim.\nThe Terminix certification of incorporation provides\nthat, unless Terminix consents in writing to the\nselection of an alternative forum, the Delaware Court\nof Chancery is, to the fullest extent permitted by law,\nthe sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative\naction or proceeding brought on behalf of Terminix,\n(ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a\nfiduciary duty owed by any director, officer,\nemployee or agent of Terminix to Terminix or its\nstockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim\narising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the\nTerminix certification of incorporation or bylaws or\n(iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the\ninternal affairs doctrine.\nConflicts of Interest\nUnder English law, a director is under a duty to\navoid a situation in which he or she has, or can\nhave, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or\npossibly may conflict, with the interests of the\ncompany and is obliged to declare his or her interest\nin a proposed or ongoing transaction to the other\ndirectors.

Interested directors may be counted in\ndetermining the presence of a quorum at a meeting\nof the board of directors or of a committee that\nauthorizes the contract or transaction.\nUnder Delaware law, an interested director could be\nheld liable for a transaction in which such director\nderived an improper personal benefit.\nNon-Competition Provisions\nThe Rentokil Initial articles of association do not\ncontain any non-competition provisions.\nThe Terminix certificate of incorporation and bylaws\ndo not contain any non-competitive provisions.\nRights of Inspections\nUnder English law, a company must retain and keep\navailable for inspection by shareholders free of\ncharge, and by any other person on payment of a\nprescribed fee, its register of shareholders. It must\nalso keep available for inspection by shareholders\nfree of charge records of all resolutions and\nmeetings by shareholders and, for a fee, provide\ncopies of the minutes to shareholders who request\nthem. Shareholders may also inspect the service\ncontracts of directors at Rentokil Initial\u2019s registered\noffices during business hours.\nIn each case, the records of all resolutions and\nmeetings by shareholders should be kept for at least\n10 years. These records may be kept in electronic\nform, as long as they are capable of being produced\nin hard copy form.\nThe Rentokil Initial articles of association provide\nUnder Section 220 of the DGCL, a stockholder or its\nagent has a right to inspect Terminix\u2019s stock ledger,\na list of all of its stockholders and its other books\nand records during the usual hours of business\nupon written demand stating his purpose (which\nmust be reasonably related to such person\u2019s interest\nas a stockholder).

Such a claim may only be brought in\nrespect of a cause of action arising from an actual or\nproposed act or omission involving negligence,\ndefault, breach of duty or breach of trust by a\ndirector of the company. It is immaterial whether the\ncause of action arose before or after the person\nseeking to bring the claim became a shareholder of\nthe company. A person seeking to bring a derivative\nclaim must obtain the permission of the courts of\nEngland and Wales to continue that claim after\nissue.\nThe courts of England and Wales must refuse the\nclaim if the action would not promote the success of\nthe company, or the company authorized the\ndirector\u2019s action or omission before it occurred, or\nhas since ratified the action or omission (in both\ncases provided the act is capable of authorization or\nratification). If there is no absolute bar to continuing\nthe claim, the courts of England and Wales must\nconsider the following (non-exhaustive) factors: (a)\nwhether the shareholder is acting in good faith, (b)\nthe importance that a person acting in accordance\nwith the duty to promote the success of the\ncompany would accord to the proposed claim, (c)\nwhether a proposed or past act or omission would\nbe likely to be authorized or ratified, (d) whether the\ncompany has decided not to pursue the claim, (e)\nwhether the shareholder has a cause of action that\nhe or she may pursue in his or her own right rather\nthan on behalf of the company and (f) the views of\nthe shareholders of the company who have no\npersonal direct or indirect interest in the matter.\nThe UK Companies Act 2006 also permits a\nshareholder to apply to the courts of England and\nWales for relief on the grounds that: (1) the\ncompany\u2019s affairs are being or have been conducted\nin a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of all\nor some shareholders, including the shareholder\nmaking the claim or (2) any act or omission of the\ncompany is or would be so prejudicial.\nGenerally, Terminix is subject to potential liability\nunder the federal securities laws and under Delaware\nlaw. Under the DGCL, a stockholder may bring a\nderivative action on behalf of the corporation to\nenforce the rights of the corporation. Generally, a\nperson may institute and maintain such a suit only if\nsuch person was a stockholder at the time of the\ntransaction that is the subject of the suit or his or\nher shares thereafter devolved upon him or her by\noperation of law. The DGCL also requires that the\nderivative plaintiff make a demand on the directors\nof the corporation to assert the corporate claim\nbefore the suit may be prosecuted by the derivative\nplaintiff, unless such demand would be futile. In\ncertain circumstances, class action lawsuits are\navailable to stockholders.\n227 \ni. \nii. \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nRentokil Initial\nTerminix\nThe UK Limitation Act 1980 imposes a limitation\nperiod, with certain exceptions, of civil claims.

            "text": "Hygiene & Wellbeing\nRentokil Initial provides hygiene services to business environments to make them cleaner, safer, healthier\nand more pleasant places in which to operate. Establishing good hygiene practices throughout an\nand more pleasant places in which to operate. Establishing good hygiene practices throughout an\norganization reduces the risk of infection being passed from person to person. As a result, fewer days are\nlost to sickness, which translates directly into real cost savings and increased productivity. Rentokil Initial\noffers a wide range of washroom hygiene services, including the provision and maintenance of products\nsuch as air fresheners, sanitizers, feminine hygiene units, hand dryers, paper and linen towel dispensers,\nsoap dispensers, toilet paper dispensers and floor protection mats. The Hygiene & Wellbeing segment also\nincludes three additional services: Ambius, Dental Services and Cleanroom Services. Ambius operates in 17\ncountries and its product offering is broadly consistent across the world and includes interior landscaping,\nChristmas decorations and premium scenting. The Dental Services business specializes in the professional\nand compliant disposal and recycling of dental waste and provides waste separating products to customers\nin Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, the U.S. and Switzerland. The Cleanroom Services business offers a\nspecialist cleanroom service, such as clothing rental and laundering, which includes a pickup and delivery\n238 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nservice, implementation, contamination control (wet, dry and particle monitoring), client specific\ndecontamination, textile-care and sterilization, for the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors in Europe.\nThe core offer in Rentokil Initial\u2019s former Hygiene business had been based around the provision of regular\nwashroom services to customer premises. It had grown the business through broad-based operational\nimprovements in product range, density (product penetration and postcode density), service quality,\nproductivity, innovation, digital applications and products, sales capability and highly targeted M&A. As\ncustomers and colleagues return to hospitality venues and offices, Rentokil Initial is seeking to expand its\nbusiness from beyond the washroom into new, higher-growth areas inside premises and the wider\nenvironment.\nThe Hygiene & Wellbeing segment also serves all customer groups and, depending on individual market,\nRentokil Initial uses a mixture of digital marketing strategies (such as Search Engine Optimization, Pay-Per-\nClick marketing, social media marketing, content marketing, email marketing and webinars), direct response\ntelevision advertising, direct mail and telemarketing. Rentokil Initial also markets its services and products\nby participating in various industry conferences and events and providing sponsorships.\nServices and Products\nServices. Rentokil Initial\u2019s Hygiene & Wellbeing segment offers a range of services both \u201cinside\u201d and\n\u201coutside\u201d the washroom. Rentokil Initial\u2019s hygiene technicians provide a wide range of services to meet the\nenhanced expectations for hygiene, involving the following services: core washroom hygiene services by\nusing its scale service expertise and innovations\u037e premises hygiene services by leveraging its expertise\noutside the washroom such as specialist hygiene services in air care and clinical waste management\u037e and\nenhanced environment services by improving the occupant experience with premium scenting, plants, air\nmonitoring and green walls.\nProducts. Rentokil Initial\u2019s Hygiene & Wellbeing products for inside the washroom provide a range of\ninnovative products for creating safer washrooms, including hand hygiene (soaps and driers), air care\n(purification and scenting), in-cubicle (feminine hygiene units), no-touch products and digital hygiene\nservices. Outside the washroom, Rentokil Initial provides primarily hand hygiene products and air care\nproducts.\n\u201cInside\u201d the Washroom. Washrooms are potentially higher risk areas for COVID-19 and other viruses, and\nno-touch washrooms are the most effective way to avoid cross-contamination, particularly within cubicle\nsettings. For example, toilet paper dispensers that seal away paper until use, no-touch feminine hygiene\nunits and toilet seat cleaners prevent cross-contamination. Rentokil Initial\u2019s Signature Range of washroom\nproducts have antimicrobial surfaces which helps reduce cross-contamination, as do its \u201cno touch\u201d auto-lift\nlids on bins and auto dispense of paper towels and soaps. Air care quality is also an important indicator of\nwashroom cleanliness, with air purification units providing an ongoing method of removing potentially\nharmful pathogens from the air. The greater awareness of in-cubicle and washroom hygiene is providing\nmore opportunities for new products and services for inside washrooms. Rentokil Initial expects to launch a\nnew Rapid>Smarthygiene high-end range of washroom solutions in 2022, which uses sensor technology to\ncollect key statistics that can be analyzed to reveal usage patterns and trends relating to user behaviors. The\nRapid>Smarthygiene solutions include Rapid>Foam (designed to optimize soap dosage for high-traffic\nenvironments), Rapid>Water (designed to reduce water consumption), Rapid>Flush (designed to provide\nodor control and reduced lime scale build up and bacteria growth by injecting a consistent amount of a\nfragranced chemical into every flush) and Rapid>Lights (designed to indicate cubicle occupancy to reduce\nunnecessary queues).\n\u201cOutside\u201d the Washroom. The COVID-19 pandemic increased demand for hand hygiene, and Rentokil Initial\nis developing service innovations to satisfy long-term social behavior change with a range of new solutions\nwhich include new hand hygiene products that enable positioning outside the washroom, new consumables\nfor hand and surface, and larger-capacity soap and sanitizer dispensers. In addition, Rentokil Initial is\ndeveloping service solutions to provide to new target customer sectors, such as food processing and\nhealthcare, which require specific hardware and consumables to comply with higher hygiene standards. With\nrespect to air care, Rentokil Initial\u2019s current air care product range features air purification, air sterilization\nand air scenting products, and in 2020 it launched two important air filtration products: VIRUSKILLER\n and\nInspire Air72 Air Purifier. When independently tested against Coronavirus DF2 (a surrogate for\nCoronavirus), Adenovirus, Influenza and Polio, VIRUSKILLER\n was found to kill\n239 \nTM\nTM\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n99.9999% of viruses on a single air pass. VIRUSKILLER\n is also sold to a range of customers including car\nshowrooms, hotels, offices, venues and UK embassies. Rentokil Initial was appointed Specialist Hygiene\nServices Partner of London\u2019s O2 arena, with the installation of VIRUSKILLER\n central to the appointment,\nand it successfully installed the units in time for the 2021 BRIT Awards. In addition, Rentokil Initial\u2019s air\npurifier, InspireAir 72, helps improve indoor air quality to create a safer and more hygienic environment for\nhomes and businesses, including offices, learning centers, hotels, retail spaces and health care facilities.\nInspireAir 72 is equipped with a high-efficiency particulate arrestance grade H14 filter that removes 99.92%\nof airborne particles. As of December 31, 2021, Rentokil Initial has installed over 13,800 air purification units\ninto customer sites across 41 countries.\nManufacturing / Supply Chain. The hardware products used in the Hygiene and Wellbeing business are\nmanufactured to a proprietary design by suppliers in Europe, Asia and the U.S. The highest volume products\ninclude feminine hygiene bins, soap dispensers and paper dispensers for toilet tissue and hand towels. The\nconsumables for these dispensers are mainly purchased locally due to the cost and environmental impact of\nshipping high-volume low-value products. Rentokil Initial has two manufacturing sites in the UK which\nmanufacture hardware and consumables, mainly for the UK and European markets. Products are managed by\na central supply chain team, either directly from supplier to market where volumes allow or via a central\nwarehouse in Antwerp, Belgium.\nMarket Opportunity\nIt is difficult to estimate the total market size for hygiene and wellbeing as the services and products in this\nmarket are fragmented. The global hygiene and wellbeing industry comprises hygiene service providers,\nconsumables suppliers (such as the supply of paper and soap) and total facilities management operators\nwho provide various services including hygiene. However, there are segments of the hygiene and wellbeing\nmarket that have more clearly outlined values, including: (i) the global smart washrooms market, which is\nestimated to be approximately $6.9 billion by 2026, with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 15.7%\nfrom 2020 to 2026 (KBV Research, \u201cGlobal Smart Bathroom Market Analysis (2020\u202f-\u202f2026)\u201d August 2020)\u037e (ii)\nthe global air care market, which is estimated to reach over $19 billion by 2026 and is expected to deliver a\n12% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to 2026 (Arizton, \u201cAir Purifier Market\u202f-\u202fGlobal Outlook and\nForecast 2021\u202f-\u202f2026\u201d June 2021)\u037e and (iii) the global corporate wellness market, which was valued at $52.8\nbillion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 7.0% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to 2028 to a value\nof $93.4 billion (Grand View Research, \u201cCorporate Wellnes Market Size & Share Report, 2021\u202f-\u202f2028\u201d).\nHygiene is an essential, non-discretionary service protecting public health, and Rentokil Initial believes its\nmedium-term opportunities are enhanced by rising demand for global hygiene driven by population growth,\ngrowth in air purification and hand sanitizer markets, rise of the millennial generation population that is\nhighly focused on health and wellbeing, urbanization, increasing legislation driving improved hygiene\nstandards and a rising global middle class with increasing hygiene standards and growing health\nconsciousness.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought what Rentokil Initial believes will be a longer-term change in attitudes\ntowards the importance and perception of health, hygiene and wellbeing, and hygiene has moved from being\nviewed as a basic commodity to an essential service. First, customers seek greater assurance from service\nproviders with brand strength during this unprecedented period of uncertainty and conflicting information.\nRentokil Initial is a market leader and one of the most recognized and trusted brands, and Rentokil Initial\nbelieves that such brand recognition will further strengthen its position in the global hygiene and wellbeing\nmarket. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to sensitivity around microbe transmission points and\nsurfaces being carriers of risk. This has led to wide-scale surface disinfection and significantly enhanced\ncleaning regimes and protocols. Third, the speed of onset and global spread of COVID-19 has led to\nsignificant local government and agency responses, along with rapidly evolving and enhanced guidelines. In\naddition, increased sensitivities around air filtering, air purification and air quality monitoring driven by\nstricter regulations and standards are presenting significant new opportunities for air hygiene services and\nproducts offered by Rentokil Initial.\nCompetitive Strategies\nFocus on operational execution. Rentokil Initial\u2019s focus has been, and will continue to be, around operational\nexcellence. It aims to achieve operational excellence by creating a high-quality customer service\n240 \nTM\nTM\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nculture, offering the best product ranges and delivering Rentokil Initial\u2019s services on time and in full.\nMargins are driven through postcode density (the number of customers on a route), product density (the\nnumber of products/service lines in each customer premise), shared overheads with the Pest Control\nsegment (infrastructure and back office) and M&A (building further geographic density). Analysis of\nRentokil Initial\u2019s current footprint supported by the right sales incentives and selling methods will drive\nbehaviors that will lead to improved density.\nOffer a complete product range to avoid cross-infection inside the washroom. Washrooms are high-risk areas for\nviruses\u037e they are small spaces, with smooth surfaces and high levels of traffic. The greater awareness of\ncubicle and washroom hygiene is providing more opportunities for new products and services for inside\nwashrooms. A range of innovative products for creating safer washrooms include hand hygiene (soaps and\ndriers), air care (purification and scenting), in-cubicle (feminine hygiene units), no-touch products and digital\nhygiene services.\nExpanding outside the washroom. Outside the washroom, high-growth areas include air care, air enhancement\nand purification, sustainable waste management (such as medical waste removal), products and expertise to\nenhance public spaces and buildings, route-based service extensions (such as first aid) and digital products\nand applications. Rentokil Initial provides products in multiple environments, such as offices, kitchens and\nreception areas, leveraging its hygiene expertise into air purification, disinfection, mats, hand sanitizers and\ndispensers and surface hygiene. Air care is a particular focus for Rentokil Initial. There is no safe level of\nairborne pollutants and, according to the World Health Organization, 68% of all diseases are related to air\npollution. About a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence began to show that COVID-19 is transmitted\npredominantly through the air by people talking and breathing out large droplets and small particles called\naerosols. Therefore, efforts have increased across the globe to prevent transmission by improving\nventilation or installing rigorously tested air purifiers.\nHarness the digital opportunity, developing digital innovations to address customer needs and increase productivity.\nRentokil Initial continues to develop digital products for enhanced services combined with greater reporting\nand insight. Rentokil Initial believes the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a springboard for increased digital\nhygiene services and is taking its digital expertise from its Pest Control business and expanding into its\nHygiene & Wellbeing business. In 2020, Rentokil Initial launched its first range of digital no-touch products,\nwhich includes taps, soap dispensers, hand wash monitoring and cubicle sanitizers. Digital monitoring of\nconsumables enables more efficient washroom operations at a lower cost, with a reduced environmental\nimpact and offering a better guest experience. Rentokil Initial is expanding its Rapid Smart Hygiene range\ninto new customers and regions, with customer trials currently under way in offices, retail malls, airports,\nleisure facilities and tourist attractions across five countries.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s digital sales and service tools are also increasing productivity and are being used to build\ncustomer awareness of its multiple product offerings. Rentokil Initial\u2019s online Hygiene customer portal,\nmyInitial, is being developed to highlight the full spectrum of Hygiene & Wellbeing solutions on its home\npage and is used by over 100,000 customers in 18 countries. The myInitial reporting platform provides\ntransparency of service, including signature capture, service history and details, dates of visits and\nreporting facilities. In addition, Rentokil Initial\u2019s colleagues use the smartphone field service application,\nServiceTrak, to record start time, services performed, customer recommendations, customer signatures and\nend time. ServiceTrak is designed to help automate, accelerate and digitize service documentation so that\nRentokil Initial\u2019s customers do not receive paper-based service reports, thereby enhancing customer\nexperience while promoting communication and process efficiency. Across 33 countries, Rentokil Initial\ntechnicians used ServiceTrak to record 7.3 million service visits and detailed information.\nGeographic expansion through organic actions. Rentokil Initial\u2019s core Hygiene services currently operate in 67\ncountries and it aims to increase the reach and density of its footprint in new markets through leveraging its\nbrand and expertise, starting with core hygiene service provision \u201cInside the Washroom,\u201d and then\nextending into premises hygiene and enhanced environments. Rentokil Initial\u2019s strategy is to expand in five\nkey areas: North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, by building on its existing\ncustomer relationships and routes in the Pest Control business and targeting North America, and using its\nexisting Ambius and Pest Control businesses.\n241",

Rentokil\nInitial believes people are its biggest competitive advantage and the key to profitable growth. Rentokil Initial\nstrives to be an employer of choice and seeks to drive ongoing improvements in colleague retention, which\nin turns leads to greater customer retention. Key actions taken in 2021 towards these goals included\ndelivering the next phase in Rentokil Initial\u2019s long-term Employer of Choice program by rolling\n242 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nout a new diversity, equality and inclusion upskilling initiative to approximately 1,000 managers and leaders.\nColleague retention remained high at 84.4%, and new job applications received through Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nCareers portal increased by 52%.\nIn addition, Rentokil Initial has a management team of highly experienced leaders across all countries where\nit operates, many of whom have been with Rentokil Initial for over 10 years. The members of Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nmanagement team have strong and proven capabilities, and possess deep knowledge of the industries and\nmarkets within which they work, as well as leverage technology to innovate and grow the business. Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s compensation structure is tied to key performance metrics that are designed to incentivize senior\nmanagement to drive the long-term success of its business. Rentokil Initial believes its management team has\nthe dedication and experience to position the business for continued success and to implement and execute\nits business strategies at pace, as well as over the long term.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s highest priority is ensuring everyone goes home safely at the end of the working day.\nHealth and safety is the first item on the agenda at every management meeting including the Executive\nLeadership Team and Board meetings. Over the past seven years Rentokil Initial\u2019s safety performance has\nimproved consistently, with its Lost Time Accident (\u201cLTA\u201d) rate improving from 2.06 in 2008 to 0.38 in 2021,\nthe lowest LTA rate ever achieved. Listening to colleagues\u2019 opinions has been a bedrock of Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nculture. In 2021, Rentokil Initial undertook Your Voice Counts, a global, confidential survey providing every\ncolleague with the opportunity to give feedback on workplace culture, leadership, customer focus,\ndevelopment and line manager performance. With a record high response rate of 91%, Rentokil Initial\nmaintained high levels of colleague engagement (80%) and colleague enablement (83%), and 25 questions\nsaw improvements in their scores over pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Strong improvements were made with\ncolleagues feeling informed about news concerning Rentokil Initial and its overall strategic direction. In\nparticular, scores for equal opportunities came in 10% higher than the global high-performance norm of\nleading companies.\nRentokil Initial is a diverse organization by its nature, operating in 88 countries and across 40 languages.\nRentokil Initial has strived, and will continue to strive, to ensure that its local businesses reflect the\ncountries, markets and communities in which they operate and to create an environment where everyone\u2019s\nview is heard, everyone\u2019s contribution matters and everyone has equal opportunities to succeed. Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s new workplace strategy through to 2024 places even greater emphasis on wider diversity where\neveryone, regardless of gender identity, race, color, nationality, age, sexual orientation, physical ability or\nbackground, can reach the highest levels based on merit. In support of this strategy, in 2021 Rentokil Initial\ndeployed a global diversity, equality and inclusion upskilling initiative to managers and leaders. The program\nfeatured two elements: \u201cInclude,\u201d where sessions focused on how to foster an inclusive environment, and\n\u201cDecide,\u201d which focused on bias and how to mitigate it. In 2021, approximately 1,000 managers and leaders\nparticipated in this program, with highly positive feedback. In June 2021, Rentokil Initial reviewed and\nupdated its Group Diversity, Inclusion & Equality Policy to further strengthen its focus on equality. This\npolicy is published internally on the Rentokil Initial intranet and externally on its corporate website.\nIn 2021, Rentokil Initial\u2019s U+ courses were viewed 4.3 million times (compared to 3.2 million in 2020, a 34%\nincrease), and more than 500 new pieces of learning content, including videos and courses, were created by\nan in-house content development team. This equates to an average of 107 content views per colleague\nthroughout 2021, up from 79 views per colleague in 2020 (an increase of 26%) with each colleague completing\na U+ training course on average every two working days during 2021. During 2021 Rentokil Initial has\ncontinued to provide employment and development opportunities to young people, employing over 350\napprentices and over 330 graduates across its UK business. It also took part in the UK government\u2019s\nKickstart Scheme aimed at people aged between 16 and 24 who are claiming Universal Credit and are at risk\nfor long-term unemployment.\nWith the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic creating many challenges for Rentokil Initial\u2019s colleagues and\ntheir families, in 2020 it established a Colleague Support Fund of approximately \u00a3450,000 to aid those within\nRentokil Initial in countries where government support schemes were insufficient for the severe difficulties\nthey faced. This was created using funds from RI Cares, together with a voluntary salary waiver by the Chief\nExecutive Officer of 65% of his salary for the second quarter of 2020 (having already waived 35% as part of\nRentokil Initial\u2019s response to the pandemic), together with salary or director\u2019s fee waivers by\n243",

            "text": "Sustainability Initiatives\nBeginning in 2020, Rentokil Initial developed a business-wide operational approach to environmental\nsustainability. In 2021, Rentokil Initial began to execute its new plan, which involved a commitment to\nachieving net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions from its operations by the end of 2040.\nThis ambitious goal is fully aligned with Rentokil Initial\u2019s business plan and operations, has clear\ndeliverables and is one of the ways in which it seeks to deliver with impact its social purpose of protecting\npeople and enhancing lives. Rentokil Initial believes that its goal to be at net zero emissions from its\noperations by the end of 2040 is bold, given it operates in 88 countries, including many emerging markets.\nHowever, Rentokil Initial has a proven record of meeting such targets in the past: over the past 10 years, it\nhas met its targets for 10% reduction in its emissions intensity index (2011 - 2015) and a further 20%\nreduction in its emissions intensity index (2016 - 2019). Rentokil Initial also believes it will unlock a new level\nof energy and innovation as it seeks to establish itself as the leader in environmental sustainability in its\nindustry. Rentokil Initial\u2019s pathway to net zero by the end of 2040 includes a number of milestones along the\nway. Key elements of its plan include the transition to a low-emission fleet, the reduction in its energy\nemissions through the transition to renewable property electricity, and reduction in emissions from the use\nof chemicals, each of which are under way, and are detailed below.\nTransitioning to an Ultra-Low Emissions Fleet\nThe implementation of Rentokil Initial\u2019s strategy to transition its current fleet of internal combustion engine\nvehicles to ultra-low emission vehicles (\u201cULEVs\u201d) is gaining momentum. Rentokil Initial now has a range of\nULEVs across its fleet including electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d), plugin hybrid EVs, non-plug-in hybrids, e-\nmotorbikes, hybrid motorbikes and e-trikes. 157 ULEVs were delivered in 2021, with Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nbusinesses in Europe and the UK leading the way. One of Rentokil Initial\u2019s key transitional risks is access to\nsuitable low emission vehicles. Battery electric vehicles remain its primary focus, secondly, plug-in hybrids\nand then, where technology is not readily available or not yet cost-effective, non-plug-in hybrid products\nwill be used to reduce Rentokil Initial\u2019s vehicle-related carbon dioxide emissions. Rentokil Initial has also\nconsidered the reputational transitional risk of not having a more sustainable fleet. Although the EV market\nhas good product coverage for cars, and increasingly small vans, Rentokil Initial anticipates from 2023 larger\nelectric battery vans will have better capability and it is also looking at hydrogen vehicles as an alternative,\nas they become viable. In 2021, Rentokil Initial also commenced a pilot of natural gas vehicles, giving it\nfurther options for ULEV fleet vehicles. In addition to Rentokil Initial\u2019s transition to ULEVs, it has a number\nof regional initiatives to implement telematics on its vehicles, delivering major benefits in reducing vehicle\nemissions, driver behavior and route management. Rentokil Initial has also completed implementation of\n\u201cSolight\u201d boxes on trucks, which provide a 15% weight reduction.\nRenewable Electricity for Rentokil Initial\u2019s Properties\nRentokil Initial\u2019s approach to reducing its emissions from purchased electricity is to introduce green energy\nor renewable tariffs for its owned buildings, with the focus on its top 20 countries (accounting for over 85%\nof its global electricity consumption). Three of these operations have already begun to transition. Italy is\nRentokil Initial\u2019s first country operation to be 100% renewable. In Australia, its main Sydney and Melbourne\nbranches use fully renewable electricity, and its operation in the UK is at over 90% renewable electricity. In\ncountries where renewable opportunities are extremely limited, due to energy supply arrangements and/or\ncost, Rentokil Initial\u2019s short-term focus is on reducing energy consumption through on-site options such as\nsolar.\nAs well as focusing on energy efficiency at Rentokil Initial\u2019s larger facilities, it is also prioritizing energy\nsavings that it can make at a local level. These include installation of LED lighting in branches and\nwarehouses, and new systems to switch off lights, heating and air conditioning, with motion-sensors to\nswitch off automatically. Rentokil Initial\u2019s immediate target is to have five to ten major markets use 100%\nrenewable electricity by 2025 and it currently estimates transitioning around 90% of properties by 2030.\n244",

Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject\nRentokil Initial to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect on its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety\nRentokil Initial\u2019s business is subject to various laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and\nsafety matters. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the\nenvironment, the use, storage, treatment, disposal, transportation and management of hazardous substances\nand wastes, the impact of chemicals, as well as pesticide and biocide products, on human health and safety\nand the environment, and the protection of the health and safety of Rentokil Initial\u2019s colleagues. These laws\nalso impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and\npast releases of hazardous substances, including releases by prior owners or operators of sites Rentokil\nInitial currently owns or operates. These laws and regulations can result in costs associated with\ntransporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean-up, fines, penalties,\norders requiring corrective action or suspending or otherwise impacting Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations or other\nsanctions if it is found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of\ncertain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations. Changes in such laws\nand regulations, including among others, air, water, chemical and product regulations, could impact the sales\nof some of Rentokil Initial\u2019s products or services. In addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and\ndelivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions\nto Rentokil Initial\u2019s business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should it be unable to\nmeet the demands of its customers for products or services. Environmental and regulatory matters most\nsignificant to Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations are discussed below.\nPesticide and Biocide Legislation. Various international, federal and state environmental laws and regulations\ngovern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. Rentokil Initial provides services utilizing certain\ndisinfecting, sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria,\nviruses, fungi) on hard environmental surfaces, in process fluids and on certain food products. Such\nproducts constitute \u201cpesticides\u201d or \u201cantimicrobial pesticides\u201d under the current definitions of the Federal\nInsecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\u201cFIFRA\u201d), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of\n1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides.\nRentokil Initial maintains product registrations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d).\nRegistration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay\nongoing registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and\npayment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by\nFIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and\nCalifornia imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state.\nIn Europe, the Biocidal Products Regulation (\u201cBPR\u201d) establishes a program to evaluate and authorize\nmarketing of biocidal active substances and products. BPR requires the use of only approved biocides in\nRentokil Initial\u2019s products imported to or used in the European Union. Compliance with these regulations\n(and similar regulations that have been or may be adopted elsewhere, such as the United Kingdom, Australia,\nChina, Russia, Turkey, Korea, and other countries) may require registration, notification, or certification\nregarding regulated substances, imposition of import restrictions, or in certain cases the redesign or\nreformulation of Rentokil Initial\u2019s products.\nIn addition, some of Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations involve the application of restricted-use pesticides that it\ngenerally purchases from third parties. Those operations must comply with certain standards pertaining to\nthe use of such pesticides and to the licensing of colleagues who apply such pesticides. Such regulations\nare enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations.\nU.S. Federal and State Chemicals Regulations. The primary chemicals management law in the United States, the\nToxic Substances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d), was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the\nFrank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (\u201cLCSA\u201d) in 2016. The LCSA modernizes the\noriginal 1976 legislation, aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in\ncommerce, improve the EPA capability and authority to regulate existing and new\n246 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nchemical substances, and prevent further state action or other notification programs like REACH (see below).\nThe TSCA changes mainly impact testing and submission costs for new chemical substances in the United\nStates. In addition, the EPA likely will be more aggressively using the existing TSCA tools to manage\nchemicals of concern. Certain states have their own chemical regulations, such as California\u2019s Proposition 65,\nwhich requires businesses to provide warnings to California residents about significant risk of exposures to\nchemicals in products that are known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.\nREACH. The European Union has enacted a regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and\nAuthorization of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d), which aims to manage chemical safety risks. REACH established a\nEuropean Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, Finland, which is responsible for evaluating data to determine\nhazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in Europe.\nIn addition, Korea, Taiwan, Turkey and other countries are implementing similar requirements.\nGHS. In 2003, the United Nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical\nproducts known as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (\u201cGHS\u201d).\nGHS is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals\nthrough a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates\ninformation about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets (\u201cSDSs\u201d). Most\ncountries in which Rentokil Initial operates adopted GHS-related legislation by 2021. The primary cost of\ncompliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising SDSs and product labels.\nFDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements. Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state,\nlocal and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured, used and sold by Rentokil Initial for\ncontrolling microbial growth on humans, animals and foods. In the United States, these requirements\ngenerally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). However, the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to\nfood. The FDA codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality, safety\nand effectiveness. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including\nproposing regulations for over-the-counter antiseptic drug products, which may impose additional\nrequirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the\nFDA. FDA regulations associated with the Food Safety Modernization Act may impose additional\nrequirements related to safety product lines.\nOther Environmental Legislation. Rentokil Initial is subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws\nand regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the\ntransportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary U.S. federal statutes that apply to\nRentokil Initial\u2019s activities in the United States are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act. It is also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of\n1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air,\nland and water. Under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act\nof 1980, and analogous state statutes, Rentokil Initial could be liable for contamination at current or former\nowned, leased or operated properties or at sites to which it sent wastes for disposal. Liability under these\nstatutes can be imposed on a joint and several basis and without regard to fault or the legality of the\nunderlying conduct.\nRentokil Initial cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental laws on its operations. Changes in,\nor new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously\nunknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, may\nlead to additional compliance or other costs.\nData Privacy\nRentokil Initial is required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and\nstandards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. In\nthe U.S., Rentokil Initial is, or may become, subject to numerous federal, state and local data privacy and\nsecurity laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, sharing, use, retention, disclosure, security,\ntransfer, storage and other processing of personal information, including federal and state data privacy laws,\ndata breach notification laws, and data disposal laws.

In 1996,\nRentokil Limited acquired British Electric Traction and the \u201cInitial\u201d brand to become Rentokil Initial. Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s purpose is to protect people from the dangers of pest-borne disease and the risks of poor hygiene\nand to enhance lives with services that protect the health and wellbeing of people and the reputation of its\ncustomers\u2019 brands. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Rentokil Initial recorded revenue of \u00a32,956.6\nmillion and operating profit of \u00a3346.5 million.\nAs of January 1, 2022 Rentokil Initial made changes to the regional operating segments, designed to provide\nclearer geographic links and to align growth strategies, as follows:\nNorth America: Puerto Rico joined the Latin America region\nEurope: Includes Nordics (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Poland), previously in UK & Rest\nof World region\nUK & Sub-Saharan Africa: No change to UK, Ireland & Baltics. Sub-Saharan Africa remained in this\nregion.

However, in response to the rising importance of hygiene and wellbeing services, as of January 1,\n2022 Rentokil Initial reorganized its business segments, primarily expanding the former Hygiene segment to\nbecome Hygiene & Wellbeing and reclassifying the businesses in its former Protect & Enhance segment,\neffective as of January 1, 2022. The Protect & Enhance segment had included five businesses: Ambius,\nProperty Care, Dental Services, Cleanroom Services and Workwear (France). The Ambius, Dental Services\nand Cleanroom Services businesses have been added to the enlarged segment, now called Hygiene &\nWellbeing, the Property Care business has been added to the Pest Control segment and Workwear (France)\nhas been left as a stand-alone segment.\nThe segment financial information presented reflects these reclassifications to conform the presentation in\nthe relevant periods to the revised operating segment structure.\nAccordingly, as of January 1, 2022, Rentokil Initial operates three business segments: Pest Control, Hygiene\n& Wellbeing and Workwear (France). However, Rentokil Initial considers Pest Control and Hygiene &\nWellbeing to be its core business segments. The Pest Control business, which operates in 87 countries, is\nthe world\u2019s leading international commercial pest control service provider, offering high levels of risk\nmanagement, reassurance and responsiveness to customers.

Ambius operates in 16 countries and its\nproduct offering is broadly consistent across the world and includes interior landscaping, Christmas\ndecorations and premium scenting. The Dental Services business specializes in the professional and\ncompliant disposal and recycling of dental waste and provides waste separating products to\ncustomers in Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, the U.S., the UK and Switzerland. Cleanroom Services\nbusiness offers a specialist cleanroom service, such as clothing rental and laundering, which includes\na pickup and delivery service, implementation, contamination control (wet, dry and particle\nmonitoring), client specific decontamination, textile-care and sterilization, for the pharmaceutical and\nhealthcare sectors in Europe.\nWorkwear (France). Rentokil Initial\u2019s Workwear (France) segment specializes primarily in the supply\nand laundering of workwear, uniforms, cleanroom garments and personal protective wear in France.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s strategy in Workwear (France) is aimed at creating a business that has a clear market\ndifferentiation through the highest level of product and service quality by focusing on rigorous\napplication of key performance indicators to measure quality of service, using radio-frequency and\nidentity tags to improve service accountability, utilizing highest standards in washing and repair\nquality (including quality of detergents), being responsive to customer needs, dedicating a separate\nteam to focus on innovation of services and products and leveraging existing supply chain, research\nand development, processing, sales and marketing from the Pest Control and Hygiene & Wellbeing\nsegments.\nThe Impact of COVID-19 and Macro-economic Factors on Rentokil Initial\u2019s Business\nCOVID-19\nIn 2020 and 2021, Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations and financial performance have been impacted by the COVID-\n19 pandemic. During this time, Rentokil Initial experienced disruptions in its business, primarily in offices and\nthe hospitality and food service industries in the Pest Control and Hygiene & Wellbeing\n250 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsegments, driven by temporary business closures and service postponements. In particular, from mid-March\nto end of April 2020, Rentokil Initial faced the most severe disruptions resulting from local, regional and\ncountry lock-downs designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. One of Rentokil Initial\u2019s first actions as\nthe crisis deepened was to ensure that its key services qualified as \u201cessential\u201d to ensure its technicians\ncould continue to serve customers, including supermarkets, hospitals, food producers and pharmaceuticals.\nRentokil Initial also trained and equipped more than 6,000 technicians to carry out disinfection services.\nBeginning in July 2020, Rentokil Initial experienced a return to growth in the Pest Control segment as lock-\ndowns subsided and high demand in the Hygiene & Wellbeing segment for disinfection services continued.\nOver the course of 2021, Rentokil Initial\u2019s Pest Control segment experienced growth in its residential pest\ncontrol portfolio, aided by the work-from-home business environment, and its commercial pest control\nportfolio grew as the lock-down conditions generally eased around the world, resulting in the offices\nreopening and the hospitality and food service industries resuming service. Rentokil Initial\u2019s Hygiene\nsegment experienced a decrease in demand in the first half of 2021 as customer requirements for emergency\ndisinfection services significantly decreased. In addition, Rentokil Initial has experienced, to a limited extent,\nmany of the macro-economic factors felt by other companies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including\nbut not limited to, labor shortages, higher costs of PPE and products and labor due to lack of availability and\nadverse impacts on ability to service customers in a timely fashion. Rentokil expects limited impacts from\nCOVID-19 to continue in the short term.\nOverall, considering the changing nature and continuing uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic,\nRentokil Initial\u2019s ability to predict the impact of COVID-19 on its business in future periods remains limited.\nThe effects of the pandemic on its business are unlikely to be fully realized, or reflected in its financial\nresults, until future periods. The ultimate societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also\nremains unknown. In particular, Rentokil Initial cannot predict whether any worsening or continuation of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, or any resulting economic impact, will adversely affect its business.\nOther Macro-economic factors\nInflation. Rentokil Initial\u2019s cost base is largely driven by the cost of compensation for colleagues and the\ncosts of required equipment (including service equipment and uniforms, vehicles and fuel and technology\nnecessary to deliver the high quality services) and the cost of the products being used on the customer\npremises including rental equipment and consumables. All of these costs are subject to inflationary\npressures and as such, sustained elevated increases in such costs may not always be possible to pass on to\ncustomers. Over the period from 2019 to 2021, inflationary pressures were typically low in the countries in\nwhich Rentokil Initial operated and therefore passing these costs on to customers has been achievable. In\ncontrast, Rentokil Initial also has operations in Lebanon, a hyperinflationary country. The business in\nLebanon implements frequent price increases to offset the increases in cost it incurs. This demonstrates that\nRentokil Initial has operations in both low and high inflationary markets and is accustomed to a range of\ninflationary environments.\nAs a result of the invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, inflation levels globally have risen to their\nhighest in two decades, particularly impacting fuel prices, timber prices, energy prices and labor costs.\nDuring the first half of 2022, Rentokil Initial has been able to pass along the incurred inflationary impacts in\nthe form of increased prices to its customers and expects to do so for the remainder of 2022. However,\nRentokil Initial cannot predict the extent to which it may experience future cost increases. Rentokil Initial may\nbe prevented, in whole or in part, from passing these cost increases on to its existing and prospective\ncustomers, which could have a material adverse impact on Rentokil Initial\u2019s business.\nShortage of products or supply chain impacts. Rentokil Initial does not have significant exposure to\ninternational logistics as the majority of its purchased products and services are sourced in the country they\nare consumed. Where there are local shortages, products are typically able to be imported quickly from\nneighboring markets. Where global shortages exist, such as recent microchip shortages impacting IT and\nvehicle supply chains, Rentokil Initial has been able to generally extend the life of the asset until supply\nchains catch up. However, should there be long term shortages of critical products or services in the future,\nthen this may adversely impact the operational performance of Rentokil Initial.\nLabor shortages. The goods and services of Rentokil Initial are sold by front line sales colleagues and\ndelivered by a highly skilled technician workforce. These colleagues are supported by functional support\n251 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncolleagues in Rentokil Initial\u2019s offices around the world. Rentokil Initial typically retains around 85% of\ncolleagues each year, although this can vary from year to year and by market. As a result of colleagues\nleaving each year and the need to replace and hire additional colleagues for growth, Rentokil Initial has\nestablished experienced recruitment teams and processes allowing access to many different labor market\nplaces. Rentokil Initial has a very strong recruitment brand and offers attractive remuneration packages and\ncareer development opportunities. During the first half of 2021, Rentokil Initial did experience a more elevated\nnumber of resignations, in a limited number of localized geographies, following the decline in the COVID-19\npandemic around the world. This did not have a material impact on Rentokil Initial in 2021 or for the first half\nof 2022. However, a very significant shortage of labor in a specific geography in the future may limit Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s ability to service revenue opportunities while finding qualified colleagues and adversely impact the\noperational performance of Rentokil Initial.\nKey Indicators of Performance and Financial Condition and Non-IFRS Alternative Performance Measures\nRentokil Initial focuses on a variety of indicators and key operating and financial metrics, including certain\nnon-IFRS measures, to monitor the financial condition and performance of its business. These metrics\ninclude Revenue, Operating Profit, Ongoing Revenue (at CER), Ongoing Operating Profit (at CER), Adjusted\nProfit before Tax, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Organic Revenue Growth, Free Cash Flow\nConversion, Customer Retention, Colleague Retention and Lost Time Accident Rate.\nRevenue. Revenue results are primarily a function of the volume and pricing of the services and products\nprovided to Rentokil Initial\u2019s customers by the business, as well as the mix of services and products\nprovided across the business. The volume of revenue is impacted by new unit sales, the retention of existing\ncustomers and acquisitions. Rentokil Initial serves both residential and commercial customers. During 2021,\nsales were generated across 88 countries, with the only countries accounting for equal to or greater than\n10% of revenue from external customers being the U.S. (42%) and France (10%).\nOperating Profit. This measure is calculated as Revenue less Operating Expenses, with Operating Expenses\nconsisting of employee costs, direct materials and services, vehicle costs, property costs, depreciation and\nimpairment of property, plant and equipment, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, one-off\nitems\u202f-\u202foperating and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include professional fees,\nmarketing costs, amortization of contract assets and movements in bad debt provision.\nOngoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating Profit (each at CER). These non-IFRS measures represent the\nperformance of the continuing operations of Rentokil Initial (including acquisitions) after removing the effect\nof disposed or closed businesses. Ongoing measures enable Rentokil Initial\u2019s management to focus on the\nperformance of the businesses retained and will therefore contribute to future performance. Ongoing\nOperating Profit is an adjusted measure and is presented before the amortization and impairment of intangible\nassets (excluding computer software), one-off items (see below) and gain or loss on disposal of businesses.\nGiven the international nature of Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations, foreign exchange movements can have a\nsignificant impact on the reported results of Rentokil Initial when they are translated into sterling (the\nfunctional currency of Rentokil Initial). In order to help understand the underlying trading performance of\nthe business, revenue and profit measures are often presented at constant exchange rates (CER). CER is\ncalculated by translating current-year reported numbers at the full-year average exchange rates for the prior\nyear. See \u201c- Constant Exchange Rates (CER)\u201d below.\nAdjusted Profit before Tax. This non-IFRS measure is used to give management and investors an\nunderstanding of the underlying profitability of the business over time. Adjusted Profit before Tax is\ncalculated by adding the following items back to Profit before Income Tax: amortization and impairment of\nintangible assets (excluding computer software), one-off items (operating and associates) and net interest\nadjustments. Intangible assets (excluding computer software) are recognized on acquisition of businesses\nwhich, by their nature, can vary by size and amount each year. As a result, amortization of intangibles is\nadded back to assist with understanding the underlying trading performance of the business and to allow\ncomparability across regions and segments. One-off items are significant expenses or income that will have a\ndistortive impact on the underlying profitability of Rentokil Initial. Typical examples are costs related to the\nacquisition of businesses (including aborted acquisitions), gain or loss on disposal or closure of a business,\nmaterial gains or losses on disposal of fixed assets, adjustments to legacy property-related provisions\n(environmental liabilities), and payments or receipts as a result of legal disputes. Net interest adjustments\n252 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nare other non-cash accounting gains and losses that can cause material fluctuations and distort\nunderstanding of the performance of the business, such as net interest on pension schemes and interest fair\nvalue adjustments. These adjustments are made to aid year on year comparability.\nFree Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS metric that is measured as net cash from operating activities,\nadjusted for cash flows related to the purchase and sale of property, plant, equipment and intangible fixed\nassets, cash flows related to leased assets and dividends received from associates. These items are\nconsidered by management to be non-discretionary, as continued investment in these assets is required to\nsupport the day-to-day operations of the business. This measure is also used by management to assess how\nmuch cash there is to reinvest into the business for future growth through people, technology and M&A.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Adjusted Profit after Tax\nattributable to equity holders of Rentokil Initial by the weighted average number of shares in issue during\nthe year, excluding those held in the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust which are treated as cancelled,\nand including share options for which all conditions have been met. Adjusted earnings per share is a non-\nIFRS metric that is calculated as earnings per share adjusted for the after-tax effects of one-off items\n(including the net gain on disposal of businesses), amortization and impairment of intangibles, and net\ninterest adjustments. This supplemental measure is also used by management to gain an understanding of\nthe underlying earnings per share performance of the business over time and enable company-to-company\ncomparisons.\nOrganic Revenue Growth. Organic Revenue Growth measures are non-IFRS metrics that are used to help\nunderstand the underlying performance of Rentokil Initial. These supplemental measures are also used by\nmanagement to develop forecasts in tracking performance, serving as a key metric in certain of Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s compensation programs. Organic Revenue growth represents the growth in Ongoing Revenue (at\nCER) excluding the effect of businesses acquired during the year. Acquired businesses are included in\norganic measures in the year following acquisition, and the comparative period is adjusted to include an\nestimated full year performance for growth calculations (pro forma revenue).\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is measured as Free Cash\nFlow adjusted for the cash impact of one-off items\u202f-\u202foperating and product development additions. This\nmeasure is also used by management to determine the efficiency at which the business is able to convert\nprofits into cash. Free Cash Flow conversion is calculated by dividing Adjusted Free Cash Flow by Adjusted\nProfit after Tax attributable to equity holders of the Company, expressed as a percentage. Adjusted Profit\nafter Tax attributable to equity holders of the Company is defined as Adjusted Profit before Tax adjusted for\nthe tax effect of amortization and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and one-off\nitems\u202f-\u202foperating and net interest adjustments.\nCustomer Retention. Customer Retention is used to track the retention of Rentokil Initial\u2019s renewable\ncustomers and is calculated on a rolling, 12-month basis in order to avoid seasonal anomalies. Defined as\ntotal portfolio value of customers retained as a percentage of opening portfolio. Rentokil Initial views\nCustomer Retention as one of the key indicators of the long term success of the business. Customer\nRetention was 85.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2022, 85.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021,\n84.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 86.2% in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nColleague Retention. Defined as total Sales and Service colleagues retained in year as a percentage of sales\nand service headcount at start of the year. Rentokil Initial considers Colleague Retention to be a key driver\nof Customer Retention. Colleague Retention was 84.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, 88.6% in the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 and 86.9% in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of 4.2\npercentage points in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nwas a result of colleagues who joined the business at the height of the pandemic and employment\nuncertainty in 2020, leaving Rentokil Initial in 2021 as other sectors recovered. In the six months ended June\n30, 2022 Rentokil Initial maintained its colleague retention rate in the mid-eighties percent range, although\ndown by 1% on 2021, on a rolling 12-month basis.\nLost Time Accident Rate. Defined as the number of lost time accidents per 100,000 standard working hours.\nRentokil Initial views Lost Time Accident Rate as a key measure of Rentokil Initial\u2019s colleagues\u2019 injury\nprevention. The rate was 0.38 in the six months ended June 30, 2022, 0.38 in the year ended December 31,\n2021, 0.39 in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 0.53 in the year ended December 31, 2019.\n253 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCertain Components of Results of Operations\nProfit before Income Tax. This is calculated as Revenue less Operating Expenses and net finance costs plus\nshare of profit from associated undertakings (net of tax).\nIncome Tax Expenses. The income tax expense for the period comprises both current and deferred tax. Current\ntax expense represents the amount payable on this year\u2019s taxable profits and any adjustment relating to prior\nyears. Taxable profits differ from accounting profits as some items of income or expenditure are not taxable or\ndeductible or may be taxable or deductible in a different accounting period. The current income tax charge is\ncalculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the\ncountries where Rentokil Initial\u2019s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Deferred\ntax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences\nbetween accounting and tax bases. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to apply when\nthe timing difference reverses based on tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance\nsheet date.\nProfit for the Year. This measure is calculated as Profit before Income Tax less Income Tax Expenses.\nFor definitions of Revenue and Operating Profit (including Operating Expenses), see \u201c- Key Indicators of\nPerformance and Financial Condition.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of Rentokil Initial\u2019s results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2022\nand 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nThe following table summarizes Rentokil Initial\u2019s results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2022\nand 2021:\nSix months \nended June\n30, \n2022\nSix months \nended June\n30, \n2021\nPercent\nChange\n2022\n(in millions, except percentages)\nRevenue\n\u00a3\n1,572.1\n\u00a3\n1,454.7\n8.1\nOperating expenses:\nEmployee costs\n748.3\n687.6\n8.8\nDirect materials and services\n311.0\n305.0\n2.0\nVehicle costs\n84.9\n70.4\n20.6\nProperty costs\n34.5\n30.5\n13.1\nDepreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment\n63.6\n62.5\n1.8\nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\n46.4\n43.8\n5.9\nOne-off items\u202f-\u202foperating\n23.1\n10.9\n111.9\nOther operating expenses\n90.6\n83.4\n8.6\nTotal operating expenses\n1,402.4\n1,294.1\n8.4\nOperating profit\n169.7\n160.6\n5.6\nFinance income\n7.0\n1.7\n311.8\nFinance cost\n(19.5\n(18.0\n(8.3\nShare of profit from associates\n4.7\n4.5\n3.6\nProfit before income tax\n161.9\n148.8\n8.8\nIncome tax expense\n(37.7\n(29.6\n(27.4\nProfit for the year\n\u00a3\n124.2\n\u00a3\n119.2\n4.2\n254 \n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n)\n)\n)%\n%\n%\n)\n)\n)%\n%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSix Months ended June 30, 2022 Compared to the Six Months ended June 30, 2021\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by \u00a3117.4 million, or 8.1%, to \u00a31,572.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a31,454.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Revenue was favorably impacted by organic growth\nof \u00a315.6 million, or 1.1%, and by the impact of acquisitions of \u00a365.1 million. Organic growth excluding\ndisinfection services was 7.3 %, with disinfection revenue decreasing by \u00a381.3 million, to \u00a313.8 million in the\nsix months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a395.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The organic growth\nof \u00a315.6 million consists of \u00a352.2 million from the Pest Control segment, \u00a312.6 million from the France\nWorkwear segment, and \u00a30.4 million from central & regional overheads, partially offset by a decrease of \u00a348.8\nmillion from the Hygiene & Wellbeing segment. This increase was also aided by positive foreign exchange of\n\u00a336.7 million, mainly due to pound sterling weakening against the U.S. dollar. Revenue from disposed and\nclosed businesses decreased by \u00a30.8 million, to \u00a30.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a31.7\nmillion in the six months ended June 30, 2021.

The increase in operating profit was a result of the\nincrease in revenue of \u00a3117.4 million, or 8.1%, to \u00a31,572.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a31,454.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 partially offset by the increase in operating expenses\nby \u00a3108.3 million, or 8.4%, to \u00a31,402.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a31,294.1 million in\nthe six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase in operating profit reflected business growth across all\nmajor reporting countries, regions and categories through the Group\u2019s strategy of organic growth driving\ndensity improvements and M&A integration delivering synergies.

The increase in operating profit was a result of the\nincrease in revenue of \u00a3153.3 million, or 5.5%, to \u00a32,956.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from\n\u00a32,803.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of\n\u00a3100.6 million, or 4.0%, to \u00a32,610.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a32,509.5 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2020. This increase in operating profit reflected revenue growth across all major\ncountries and regions in which Rentokil Initial operates and the execution of its high service and innovation\nand technology strategy, which drove customer retention and new sales of innovative new products to meet\nevolving customer needs. Rentokil Initial believes such execution of Rentokil Initial\u2019s business strategy\nresulted in a 1.2% increase in net operating margins to 11.7% in the year ended December 31, 2021 from 10.5%\nin the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the return of the core service\nprovision allowed Rentokil Initial to fully resume its high-quality service model. As part of this resumption,\nRentokil Initial was able to catch up on service, debt and customer satisfaction issues that had arisen during\nthe early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in the release of\n\u00a320.0 million of revenue provisions and \u00a312.0 million of bad debt provisions taken in year ended December\n31, 2020.\nProfit before Income Tax\nProfit before income tax increased by \u00a395.3 million, or 41.5%, to \u00a3325.1 million in the year ended December 31,\n2021 from \u00a3229.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition to the margin improvements\ndescribed above, Rentokil Initial also incurred lower net finance costs of \u00a329.5 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, a decrease of \u00a342.8 million, or 59.2%, from \u00a372.3 million in the year ended December 31,\n2020 due to the non-recurrence of the \u00a328.4 million cost of closing out an interest derivative linked to U.S.\ninterest rates, and other fair value losses of \u00a39.5 million in 2020.\nIncome Tax Expenses\nIncome tax expenses increased by \u00a318.4 million, or 42.3%, to \u00a361.9 million in the year ended December 31,\n2021 from \u00a343.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the margin improvements described\nabove.

The increase in operating profit was a result of the\nincrease in revenue of \u00a399.1 million, or 3.7%, to \u00a32,803.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a32,704.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of\n\u00a370.9 million, or 2.9%, to \u00a32,509.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a32,438.6 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating profit was impacted in the year ended December 31, 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic related net\nrevenue reductions, particularly in the second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2020. Rentokil Initial\ntook significant actions to mitigate the revenue reductions with cost savings of \u00a3121.8 million for the year\nended December 31, 2020. Such cost-saving measures included salary reductions across management,\ncancellation of bonus schemes in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2020 and postponement of the\n2020 long term incentive plan grant to the second half of the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as tight\ncontrol over discretionary spend. These savings, however, were offset by an increased bad debt provision of\n\u00a334.0 million, increased costs of personal protective equipment of \u00a325.0 million (predominantly driven by the\nneed for comprehensive personal protective equipment when recording the provision for disinfection\nservices in the Hygiene segment) and increased restructuring costs of \u00a35.5 million.\nProfit before Income Tax\nProfit before income tax decreased by \u00a3108.7 million, or 32.1%, to \u00a3229.8 million in the year ended December\n31, 2020 from \u00a3338.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The main driver of the decrease was the net\ngain on disposals of \u00a3103.8 million due to the disposal of the 17.8% interest in CWS-boco International\nGmbH to Franz Haniel & Cie.

As a result, Rentokil Initial was subject to an\neffective tax rate of 18.9% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to an effective tax rate of 16.2% in\nthe year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in tax rate was driven by the profit on sale of businesses of\n\u00a3103.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 being non-taxable.\nProfit for the Year\nProfit for the year decreased by \u00a397.5 million, or 34.4%, to \u00a3186.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020\nfrom \u00a3283.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in profit was a result of the decrease\nin profit before income tax of \u00a3108.7 million, or 32.1%, to \u00a3229.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020\nfrom \u00a3338.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 partially offset by the decrease in income tax\nexpenses of \u00a311.2 million, or 20.5%, to \u00a343.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a354.7 million in\nthe year ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenue by Business Segment\nFollowing is a discussion of Rentokil Initial\u2019s revenues by business segment for the six months ended June\n30, 2022 and 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nThe table below sets forth revenue by business segment for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2022, Pest Control, Hygiene & Wellbeing and Workwear (France)\nsegments accounted for 69%, 25% and 6% of total revenue, respectively.

Performance was supported by both pricing and volumes, led by the commercial pest control\nbusiness. Strength in the Pest Control category is notwithstanding some pockets of disruption that have\nbeen impacted by supply chain limitations, protracted lockdown and other COVID-19-related constraints.\nThis revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2021 M&A of \u00a347.1 million and additional\nrevenue from 2022 M&A of \u00a39.6 million and foreign exchange movements having a \u00a337.4 million positive\neffect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Pest Control revenue increased\norganically by \u00a358.9 million.\nAll revenue streams increased as the COVID-19 pandemic impact lessened with contract revenue growing by\n\u00a3105.0 million to \u00a3706.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a3601.2 million in the six months\nended June 30, 2021, job revenue increasing by \u00a323.3 million to \u00a3235.5 million in the six months ended June\n30, 2022 from \u00a3212.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and product revenue going up by \u00a324.4\nmillion to \u00a3150.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a3126.4 million in the six months ended\nJune 30, 2021.\nHygiene & Wellbeing\nRevenue decreased by \u00a345.3 million, or 10.3%, to \u00a3392.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a3437.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The 2020 rapid deployment of disinfection services\nacross 60 countries provided a hedge to lower revenues caused from disruption to core hygiene service\nprovision across the Group\u2019s operations. Customers who used these services did so typically to remain open\nduring lockdowns. As expected, as the COVID-19 conditions significantly eased around the world, there was\na large reduction in customers\u2019 need for these one-time services. Disinfection revenues for the six months\nended June 30, 2022 reduced by \u00a381.3 million to \u00a313.8 million from \u00a395.1 million in the six months ended June\n30, 2021. Therefore the focus in 2022 was on protecting the existing customer base whilst targeting new\ngrowth opportunities. A ramp up in activity across service sectors such as offices, shops, schools and\nhospitality provided a tailwind to performance. Excluding the impact of disinfection revenue, revenues grew\nby \u00a336.0m, or 10.5%, in the six months to June 30, 2022 to \u00a3378.7 million from \u00a3342.7 million in the six months\nto June 30, 2021.\nFrance Workwear\nRevenue increased by \u00a310.1 million, or 12.6%, to \u00a389.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a379.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Improving market conditions were reflected in the\nstronger contribution from the France Workwear business, which overall was back to pre-COVID-19 levels. A\nlag in recovery of the \u2018as-used\u2019 business in the Paris region (which was c.90% of 2019 levels in Hotels,\nRestaurants and Catering \u2018HORECA\u2019) was balanced elsewhere including in regions where it had not\npreviously been established.\n262 \n%\n)%\n%\n%\n)%\n%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe table below sets forth revenue by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and\n2019.

Revenue was aided by an excellent performance from\nthe North America business, slightly offset by weaker performances from the Australia, New Zealand,\nMalaysia and Indonesia operations, which were materially impacted by lock-downs in the second half of the\nyear ended December 31, 2021. Despite some labor shortages in such period, due to a number of colleagues\neither off work due to COVID-19 or self-isolation, the Pest Control business in North America was the best\nperforming region. Property Care returned to organic growth with revenues returning to pre pandemic levels\nas the UK commercial housing market strengthened.\nThe increase in revenue for this segment was aided by the incremental impact of 2020 M&A of \u00a3130.7 million\nand additional revenue from 2021 M&A of \u00a343.2 million but this was partly offset by foreign exchange\nmovements having a \u00a386.5 million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and\nM&A, Pest Control revenue increased organically by \u00a3144.4 million.\nAll revenue streams increased as the COVID-19 pandemic impact lessened with contract revenue growing by\n\u00a3128.1 million to \u00a31,252.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a31,124.2 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, job revenue increasing by \u00a341.4 million to \u00a3456.6 million in the year ended December 31,\n2021 from \u00a3415.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and product revenue going up by \u00a348.7 million\nto \u00a3258.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3209.7 million in the year ended December 31,\n2020. A reduction in credit notes to \u00a310.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a318.5 million in\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 was the reason for \u00a38.2 million of the revenue increase.\nHygiene & Wellbeing\nRevenue decreased by \u00a366.0 million, or 7.4%, to \u00a3829.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from\n\u00a3895.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This reflected the anticipated tapering of disinfection\nservices, which was reduced by \u00a3108.8 million to \u00a3112.6 million. As with the Pest Control segment, however,\nthe operations in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Malaysia were held back by significant challenges\nassociated with ongoing lock-downs. The rapid deployment of disinfection services across 60 countries\nenabled Rentokil Initial to generate \u00a3221.4 million of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCustomers who used Rentokil Initial\u2019s services (such as offices, shops, schools, airports, emergency\nvehicles and public transport) did so typically to remain open during lock-down conditions. As lock-down\nconditions generally eased around the world and Rentokil Initial\u2019s core services returned, customer\nrequirements for emergency disinfection services significantly decreased, and therefore revenue from\n263 \n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndisinfection services has tapered in line with management\u2019s expectations. Dental Services and Cleanroom\nServices returned to organic growth. The Ambius business returned to modest organic growth as the prior\nyear impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic unwound and customers started to purchase discretionary Ambius\nproducts again.\nFrance Workwear\nRevenue decreased by \u00a32.0 million, or 1.2%, to \u00a3165.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from\n\u00a3167.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. In France, lock-downs began to ease in May 2021 with\nfewer restrictions on restaurant operations, and as a result, Rentokil Initial saw an improving performance\nfrom its Workwear business. While this improvement was encouraging, as-used volumes (where the\ncustomer only pays for specific garments laundered) were still behind pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels,\nimpacted by ongoing temporary customer suspensions in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2021\nand reduced tourism in France in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRevenue for the Year ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nPest Control\nRevenue decreased by \u00a315.4 million, or 0.9%, to \u00a31,721.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a31,737.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Pest Control segment was designated as an\nessential service in the majority of Rentokil Initial\u2019s markets and performed well in the year ended December\n31, 2020. Performance has varied by geography and reflects the severity and duration of local, regional and\ncountry lock-downs. Customer segments have been impacted differently by the COVID-19 pandemic. While\noffices and the hospitality and food service industries were most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and\ntherefore their demand for pest control services decreased, demand from others, including food retail,\npharmaceutical, transport and residential customers, increased. At the end of December 31, 2020, service\nprovision of 0.7% of the Pest Control customer premises remained suspended, compared to 7% at the peak of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020. One-time job revenue was strong in the year ended December 31, 2020,\naided in part by warmer weather in the northern hemisphere and also by residential customers seeking swift\nresolution to pest issues during lock-downs. The Property Care business also declined during the period by\n16.1%, reflecting the continued weakness in the UK commercial housing market.\nThis revenue decrease was despite the incremental impact of 2019 M&A of \u00a376.2 million and additional\nrevenue from 2020 M&A of \u00a318.3 million but this was partly offset by foreign exchange movements having a\n\u00a325.8 million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Pest Control\nrevenue fell organically by \u00a384.1 million.\nContract revenue increased by \u00a360.2 million to \u00a31,124.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a31,064.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 but this was offset by a decrease in job revenue of \u00a335.8\nmillion to \u00a3415.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3451.0 million in the year ended December\n31, 2019 and product revenue of \u00a322.5 million to \u00a3209.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a3232.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted these revenue\nstreams as well as increasing the amount of credit notes by \u00a312.6 million to \u00a318.5 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 from \u00a35.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nHygiene & Wellbeing\nRevenue increased by \u00a3157.2 million, or 21.3%, to \u00a3895.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a3738.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue growth in Hygiene & Wellbeing was driven by\n\u00a3221.4 million of revenue from disinfection services launched rapidly across the world in the second quarter\nof the year ended December 31, 2020. The revenue growth was offset as the core global Hygiene &\nWellbeing operations were more impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, principally due to the customers\n(particularly those in the hospitality and food service industries) were forced to temporarily close their\noperations, and therefore Rentokil Initial was unable to provide its services to such customers. Like in the\nPest Control segment, performance varied by geography and lock-down regime, and performance\nimprovements in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to an easing of lock-down\n264 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconditions in certain, but not all, countries. At the end of December 31, 2020, service provision of 4.4% of the\nHygiene & Wellbeing customer premises remained suspended compared to 22% at the peak of the COVID-19\npandemic in April 2020. The Ambius business declined during the period by 16.4%, reflecting the more\ndiscretionary nature of Ambius products.\nFrance Workwear\nRevenue decreased by \u00a318.4 million, or 9.9%, to \u00a3167.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a3186.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The revenue decrease was principally due to disruption\nin the hospitality and food services sector, delivering a revenue decline of 9.5% for the year ended December\n31, 2020. At the end of December 31, 2020, service provision of 6% of the Workwear (France) customers\nremained closed compared to 30% at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020.\nOperating Expenses by Business Segment\nFollowing is a discussion of Rentokil Initial\u2019s operating expenses by business segment for the six months\nended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nPest Control\nSix Months \nEnded June\n30, \n2022\nSix Months \nEnded June\n30, \n2021\nPercent\nchange \n2022\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n%\nEmployee costs\n522.7\n461.2\n13.3\nDirect materials and services\n196.4\n176.0\n11.6\nVehicle costs\n57.5\n44.6\n28.9\nProperty costs\n19.4\n13.3\n45.9\nDepreciation and impairment of property, plant and\nequipment\n17.1\n14.6\n17.1\nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\n33.5\n29.9\n12.0\nOne off items\u202f-\u202foperating\n4.3\n5.5\n(21.8\nOther operating expenses\n81.7\n70.3\n16.2\nTotal\n932.6\n815.4\n14.4\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2022 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2021\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by \u00a3117.2 million, or 14.4%, to \u00a3932.6 million in the six months ended June 30,\n2022 from \u00a3815.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.

This revenue increase was aided by the incremental\nimpact of 2021 M&A of \u00a331.4 million and additional revenue from 2022 M&A of \u00a34.0 million and also foreign\nexchange movements had a \u00a337.8 million positive effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange\nand M&A, North America revenue decreased organically by \u00a317.0 million largely caused by the tail off of\ndisinfection revenues.\nDisinfection revenues reduced by \u00a359.1 million to \u00a31.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a360.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 as COVID-19-related market conditions improved across\nthe region. Revenue in Pest Control grew by 19.4%, underpinned by further improved price realization. There\nwas a modest headwind in the period from unseasonably cold weather in certain parts of the country in April\n2022 which delayed the start of the pest season. The distribution business delivered good growth in the half\nyear despite ongoing supply chain challenges, and steps were taken to effectively mitigate this by managing\ninventory levels to maintain supply to customers.\nIncluding the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by \u00a375.2 million to \u00a3430.3\nmillion in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a3355.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and\nproduct revenue increased by \u00a321.2 million to \u00a3135.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a3114.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 but these increases were partly offset by job revenue\ngoing down by \u00a340.1 million to \u00a3130.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a3171.0 million in the\nsix months ended June 30, 2021.\nEurope\nRevenue increased by \u00a326.0 million, or 6.4%, to \u00a3433.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a3407.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was driven by France, which increased\nrevenues by \u00a310.9 million, or 7.3%, to \u00a3159.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a3148.7 million\nin the six months ended June 30, 2021, Latin America (including Caribbean) increasing by \u00a310.6 million, or\n23.1%, to \u00a356.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a346.0 million in the six months ended June\n30, 2021 and the Nordics, which increased by \u00a35.5 million, or 15.6%, to \u00a340.4 million in the six months ended\nJune 30, 2022 from \u00a334.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.\nThis revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2021 M&A of \u00a37.0 million and additional\nrevenue from 2022 M&A of \u00a37.6 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a36.0\nmillion adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Europe revenue\nincreased organically by \u00a317.4 million.\nThe region overall enjoyed strengthened performance, underpinned by both pricing and volumes. Pest\nControl, which led the early post-COVID-19 recovery, sustained good growth. The strength was\nnotwithstanding some pockets of continued supply chain disruption such as the German fumigation\nbusiness that was still impacted at port. In Hygiene & Wellbeing there was increased stabilization of\n270 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrelationships across sectors, with tourism, notably in southern Europe, catching up more incrementally as\nthe year proceeded. After an extended period of service suspensions due to COVID-19, Hygiene & Wellbeing\nwas back to providing full contractual service terms in the majority of markets in which it operates. Ambius,\nparticularly in northern Europe, benefited from good sales of green products, partly offset by slower\nrecovery ramp ups in the hospitality market affecting Specialist Hygiene and in the dental recycling business\nwhere the lag from reduced dental visits during COVID-19 was still affecting collection volumes. Improving\nmarket conditions were reflected in the stronger contribution from the France Workwear business, which\noverall was back to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nIncluding the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by \u00a333.8 million to \u00a3349.9\nmillion in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a3316.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and\nproduct revenue increased by \u00a32.4 million to \u00a318.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a315.7\nmillion in the six months ended June 30, 2021. These increases were partly offset by job revenue going down\nby \u00a38.9 million to \u00a363.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a372.1 million in the six months\nended June 30, 2021. Job revenue includes disinfection revenue, which was introduced as a response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, with reduced demand experienced in 2021.\nUK & Sub Saharan Africa\nRevenue increased by \u00a34.9 million, or 2.8%, to \u00a3181.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a3176.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was driven by UK, Ireland & Baltics\nincreasing revenue by \u00a34.7 million, or 3.0%, to \u00a3160.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a3155.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.\nThis revenue increase included no M&A impact and foreign exchange movements had only a \u00a30.1 million\nadverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, UK & Sub Saharan Africa revenue\nincreased organically by \u00a35.0 million.\nThe region delivered a resilient trading performance against strong comparators in the prior year, which\nprovided strong growth opportunities in both the medical waste and disinfection business streams. The\nuniversal lifting of restrictions and end of the mass testing regime meant these lines of business slowed\nsignificantly, as anticipated, into the second quarter of 2022. Contract revenue grew by \u00a36.2 million to \u00a3128.9\nmillion in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a3122.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and\ncredit notes reduced by \u00a37.3 million to \u00a31.8 million credit in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a35.5\nmillion in the six months ended June 30, 2021. These increases were partly offset by job revenue going down\nby \u00a38.0 million to \u00a346.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a354.6 million in the six months\nended June 30, 2021.\nHygiene & Wellbeing operations (including Washrooms, Medical and Specialist Hygiene) delivered good\nrevenue growth despite the roll back of Medical Testing programmes. The UK Property Care business also\nposted a solid performance in the first half of 2022, benefiting from recovery in the commercial property\nmarket, though slightly dampened by domestic property services, where growth slowed in the second\nquarter of 2022 in line with the housing market. The Ambius business showed improved performance\nreflecting ongoing easing of restrictions in hospitality, office and travel sectors.\nAsia & MENAT\nRevenue increased by \u00a321.8 million, or 16.9%, to \u00a3151.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a3129.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.\nThis revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2021 M&A of \u00a38.9 million and additional\nrevenue from 2022 M&A of \u00a30.5 million and by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a34.2 million positive\neffect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Asia & MENAT revenue increased\norganically by \u00a38.2 million.\nIn general, the Asia & MENAT region delivered an improving performance during the first half of 2022, with\nan overall uplift in revenue performance from the last quarter of 2021 into 2022. Sectors hardest hit from the\npandemic such as hospitality, retail and offices, were resuming operations leading to a gradual recovery in\ndemand for service provision in Pest Control and Hygiene. Sales of air purification solutions also\n271 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ngained traction in key markets of Indonesia and Malaysia. Due to new strict COVID-19 lockdowns in the\nperiod, China and Hong Kong countered the trend, with operations in these markets severely curtailed,\ndriving a spike in temporary customer suspensions. In addition, as expected, after an ongoing good\ncontribution into the first quarter of 2022, disinfection sales unwound markedly across most of the region\nfrom the beginning of the second quarter. Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract\nrevenue grew by \u00a314.9 million to \u00a3114.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a399.4 million in the\nsix months ended June 30, 2021, job revenue increased by \u00a33.9 million to \u00a328.5 million in the six months\nended June 30, 2022 from \u00a324.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and product revenue increased\nby \u00a32.5 million to \u00a39.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a37.3 million in the six months ended\nJune 30, 2021.\nPacific\nRevenue increased by \u00a38.9 million, or 8.9%, to \u00a3108.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from\n\u00a399.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.\nThis revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2021 M&A of \u00a32.7 million and additional\nrevenue from 2022 M&A of \u00a31.5 million and by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a30.9 million positive\neffect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Pacific revenue increased organically\nby \u00a33.8 million.\nPerformance in the Pacific continued to strengthen. In general, there was increased demand for services\nthroughout the region with the progressive reopening of markets, international travel and return to offices.\nIn Hygiene & Wellbeing, there was momentum in portfolio growth due to robust gross sales and strong\ncustomer retention. The region saw sustained demand for the range of air hygiene solutions, including\nViruskiller that was launched in Australia and New Zealand in the second half of 2021. In Pest Control, the\ncontinued strong demand in commercial was supported by a rebound in residential. The performance was\ndespite some adverse impact from the inclement weather along Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard as well as some\nreduced capacity from tightness in the labour market and enforced isolation due to COVID-19. Including the\nimpacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by \u00a36.4 million to \u00a386.8 million in the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a380.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and job revenue\nincreased by \u00a31.3 million to \u00a319.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from \u00a318.6 million in the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021.\nThe table below sets forth revenue by geographic locations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and\n2019.

This revenue increase was aided by the incremental\nimpact of 2020 M&A of \u00a3129.2 million and additional revenue from 2021 M&A of \u00a319.8 million but this was\npartly offset by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a375.2 million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the\neffect of foreign exchange and M&A, North America revenue increased organically by \u00a319.9 million. Organic\nrevenue growth was driven by broad-based momentum in all businesses and an incremental return to more\nnormalized trading patterns. Rentokil Initial saw good growth in its residential Pest Control portfolio, from\nboth acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and continued marketing and sales focus.\nResidential revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2021 was aided by a continuation of the work\nfrom home business environment. Revenues were supported by ongoing disinfection sales and, as expected,\nthese significantly tapered throughout the remainder of the year as the COVID-19 pandemic related market\nconditions improved. Sales from disinfection amounted to \u00a363.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to \u00a3142.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The overall performance in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 was also positively impacted by the recovery of the other commercial businesses: Brand\nStandards operations (which was significantly impacted in the year ended December 31, 2020 by temporary\ncustomer closures in the quick serve restaurant sector) returned to more regular trading with 95% of\ncustomers by the end of the year and the Ambius operations returned to pre-pandemic trading levels,\ndelivering growth of 2.7% on the prior year.\nIncluding the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by \u00a394.4 million to \u00a3741.0\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3646.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and\nproduct revenue increased by \u00a344.2 million to \u00a3230.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3186.2\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2020 but these increases were partly offset by job revenue going\ndown by \u00a345.2 million to \u00a3324.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3369.9 million in the year\nended December 31, 2020.\nThe newly acquired business, Environmental Pest Service, the acquisition of which was completed on\nJanuary 1, 2021, performed strongly and resulted in benefits from the business\u2019s residential concentration in\nthree important markets such as Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. The commercial pest control business\ngrowth was aided by good volumes of work broadly across most markets, and improvements were also seen\nin bird and mosquito work. The distribution business performed strongly throughout the year, which\nreflected the general market recovery of the pest services sector and the continued high demand for lawn,\ngolf and turf products.\nEurope\nRevenue increased by \u00a311.4 million, or 1.4%, to \u00a3832.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from\n\u00a3820.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven by Southern Europe, which\nincreased revenues by \u00a35.9 million, or 4.1%, to \u00a3148.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from\n\u00a3143.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, Latin America (including Caribbean) increasing by \u00a36.4\nmillion, or 7.3%, to \u00a394.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a388.5 million in the year\n273 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nended December 31, 2020 and France, which increased by \u00a33.2 million, or 1.1%, to \u00a3306.4 million in the year\nended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3303.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. These increases were\npartially offset by Germany revenues decreasing by \u00a36.7 million, or 5.6%, to \u00a3113.9 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 from \u00a3120.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThis revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2020 M&A of \u00a30.5 million and additional\nrevenue from 2021 M&A of \u00a316.9 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a323.3\nmillion adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Europe revenue\nincreased organically by \u00a317.3 million.\nThe Europe region continued to experience disruption from lock-downs and intermittent restrictions\nthroughout the year ended December 31, 2021. Despite these challenges, Workwear (France) made a good\nrecovery and the core segments performed well, with the Pest Control segment largely back to normal and\nexperiencing good growth, and with Hygiene & Wellbeing recovering well. Throughout the year, Rentokil\nInitial saw customers who remained closed reducing from 10% in the first half of the year ended December\n31, 2021 to less than 1% in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021, with trading in most\ncountries returning to more normal levels. Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract\nrevenue grew by \u00a319.0 million to \u00a3654.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3635.7 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, product revenue increased by \u00a33.3 million to \u00a332.3 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 from \u00a329.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and other revenue went up by \u00a37.1\nmillion to \u00a319.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a312.0m in the year ended December 31,\n2020. These increases were partly offset by job revenue going down by \u00a319.3 million to \u00a3133.6 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3152.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Job revenue includes\ndisinfection revenue, which was introduced as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with reduced demand\nexperienced in 2021.\nWhile Rentokil Initial continued to experience some interruptions from restrictions imposed during the fourth\nand fifth waves of the COVID-19 virus, the impact was more on COVID-19 infections in colleagues, affecting\ntheir availability rather than on customer closures. Revenue growth of 8.1% in Pest Control for the year\nended December 31, 2021 was impacted by continued lock-downs across parts of Europe and Latin America\nand poor weather in Europe which delayed the emergence of pests such as wasps and mosquitoes. The\nHygiene & Wellbeing segment (excluding disinfection) grew by 3.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021,\nwith most growth generated in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2021 due to weak comparatives\nas a result of the impact from lock-downs in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2020 . As expected,\nrevenue from disinfection services in 2021 tapered significantly throughout the year ended December 31,\n2021. Lock-downs began to ease in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021 across all markets,\nresulting in an improving performance from the France Workwear segment, which declined by 1.2% in the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, an improvement from the rate of decline in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe France Workwear segment was nevertheless impacted by temporary customer suspensions of 3.4%\nthroughout the year (being the average percentage of customer premises closed, and hence not able to be\nserviced, during the year).\nUK & Sub Saharan Africa\nRevenue increased by \u00a331.7 million, or 9.7%, to \u00a3359.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from\n\u00a3327.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven by UK, Ireland & Baltics\nincreasing revenue by \u00a329.8 million, or 10.3%, to \u00a3318.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from\n\u00a3288.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and Sub Saharan Africa increasing revenue by \u00a31.9\nmillion, or 4.8%, to \u00a340.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a338.8 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020.\nThis revenue increase included no M&A impact and foreign exchange movements had only a \u00a30.4 million\nadverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, UK & Sub Saharan Africa revenue\nincreased organically by \u00a332.1 million.\nTrading conditions in the UK businesses, which were impacted by lock-downs in the first quarter of the year\nended December 31, 2021, improved significantly from the second quarter of the year ended December 31,\n2021 as a result of continued progress with the UK\u2019s vaccination programme and subsequent\n274 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\neasing of restrictions. Recovery of the Irish operations was behind the UK, reflecting continuing government\nrestrictions, however, the trajectory of improvement was similar to that experienced in the UK, although at an\nearlier stage. A number of key actions undertaken in the year ended December 31, 2020 aided performance in\nthe UK in 2021, including accelerating the pace of Rentokil Initial\u2019s service differentiation, innovation and\ndigital marketing programmes and implementing a number of significant technology-enabled business and\ncost programmes. Contract revenue grew by \u00a34.8 million to \u00a3251.0 million in the year ended December 31,\n2021 from \u00a3246.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and credit notes reduced by \u00a326.7 million to\n\u00a35.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a332.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Hygiene & Wellbeing segment in the UK performed strongly throughout the year, driven by strong\norganic performances and the full year performance of the integrated Cannon Hygiene business. The Ambius\nbusiness performed well, growing contract portfolio in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021\nas the challenge to make office spaces suitably appealing for employee return stimulated demand for Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s products and services. The Property Care business also performed well, with revenues benefiting\nfrom strong domestic customer demand in the UK residential housing market and signs of recovery in the\ncommercial property market.\nThe Sub Saharan Africa region delivered a robust performance despite ongoing pandemic related challenges,\nincreasing revenue by \u00a31.9 million, or 4.8%, to \u00a340.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a338.8\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAsia & MENAT\nRevenue increased by \u00a38.0 million, or 3%, to \u00a3271.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3263.3\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2020. This revenue increase was driven by MENAT increasing\nrevenue by \u00a37.6 million, or 35.3%, to \u00a328.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a321.3 million in\nthe year ended December 31, 2020, India increasing revenue by \u00a34.9 million, or 10.1%, to \u00a353.6 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a348.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and China improving\nby \u00a32.9 million, or 19.1%, to \u00a317.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a315.0 million in the year\nended December 31, 2020. This was partly offset by a revenue decrease in Indonesia of \u00a32.3 million, or 5.0%,\nto \u00a342.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a344.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020\nand also in Malaysia of \u00a31.4 million, or 4.0%, to \u00a333.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a334.8\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThis revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2020 M&A of \u00a30.5 million and additional\nrevenue from 2021 M&A of \u00a38.4 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a314.4\nmillion adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Asia & MENAT\nrevenue increased organically by \u00a313.5 million.\nThis was an improving performance, but recovery was held back by difficult trading conditions in Malaysia,\nIndonesia, Vietnam and Thailand as a result of very restrictive lock-downs from late second quarter of the\nyear ended December 31, 2021 and into the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021. With fewer\nrestrictions and a higher vaccination rate, China performed considerably better, delivering revenue growth of\n19.1% in the year ended December 31, 2021. Despite ongoing macro-economic challenges in Lebanon, the\nBoecker business, acquired in August 2021, performed well with integration proceeding according to plan.\nIncluding the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by \u00a36.7 million to \u00a3204.5 million\nin the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3197.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 but job revenue\ndecreased by \u00a32.5 million to \u00a352.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a354.9 million in the year\nended December 31, 2020. Credit notes reduced by \u00a33.6 million to \u00a33.2 million in the year ended December 31,\n2021 from \u00a36.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Job revenue included disinfection revenue,\nwhich was introduced as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which decreased by \u00a30.7 million to \u00a313.3\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a314.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBoth the Pest Control and Hygiene & Wellbeing segments continued to be impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic and lock-downs in the year ended December 31, 2021, with temporary customer suspensions\npeaking at 7.9% in August 2021 but falling to 2.8% by December 2021, as Rentokil Initial\u2019s markets recovered\n275 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand its ability to service customers improved. Emergency disinfection services were broadly similar in both\nthe first and second half of the year ended December 31, 2021, providing a hedge to disruption of regular\ncore service provision.\nPacific\nRevenue increased by \u00a319.0 million, or 10.7%, to \u00a3196.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from\n\u00a3177.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Australia revenue increased by \u00a317.5 million, or 13.3%, to\n\u00a3149.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3131.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020\nand New Zealand grew by \u00a32.0 million, or 4.7%, to \u00a345.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from\n\u00a343.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThis revenue increase was aided by additional revenue from 2021 M&A of \u00a34.2 million and by foreign\nexchange movements having a \u00a33.7 million positive effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange and M&A, Pacific revenue increased organically by \u00a311.1 million.\nThe core businesses in the Pacific delivered a much improved performance in the year ended December 31,\n2021, despite intermittent lock-downs in both Australia and New Zealand impacting revenue, primarily in New\nZealand which continued a suppression strategy towards the COVID-19 pandemic. The Australian\noperations were more robust, reflecting the easing of government restrictions despite the arrival of the\nOmicron variant in November 2021. Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue\ngrew by \u00a38.1 million to \u00a3158.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a3150.3 million in the year\nended December 31, 2020 and job revenue increased by \u00a36.8 million to \u00a336.6 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 from \u00a329.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Credit notes reduced by \u00a34.6\nmillion to \u00a34.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a38.7 million in the year ended December 31,\n2020. Job revenue includes disinfection revenue, which was introduced as a response to the COVID-19\npandemic, which decreased by \u00a30.5 million to \u00a31.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from \u00a31.8\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDemand for the Pest Control services was strong throughout the year ended December 31, 2021, particularly\nin commercial pest control and bird control. Residential work in the second half of the year ended December\n31, 2021 was slightly weaker than in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting customers\ndeferring treatments during periods of lock-down. In the Hygiene & Wellbeing segment, core service\nprovision recovered well, although the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021 saw some\nweakening in service levels due to temporary site closures. Portfolio growth was strong, however, with\ncustomers responding positively to the relaunched air hygiene proposition, which was a major source of\ngrowth, and the hand sanitizer portfolio was largely maintained. The Ambius business performed well in the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, with portfolio growth above 10% as businesses began to prepare for a return\nto offices.\nRevenue for Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNorth America\nRevenue increased by \u00a3131.5 million, or 12.3%, to \u00a31,196.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a31,065.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This revenue increase was aided by the incremental\nimpact of 2019 M&A of \u00a358.4 million and additional revenue from 2020 M&A of \u00a310.9 million but this was\npartly offset by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a315.4 million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the\neffect of foreign exchange and M&A, North America revenue increased organically by \u00a377.6 million.\nRevenues in North America were supported by high volume of sales of disinfection services launched in the\nsecond quarter of the year ended December 31, 2020 and a good performance from the Pest Control business.\nDemand for residential pest control remained strong, but commercial pest services were impacted by\ntemporary business closures. Ambius and Brand Standards also saw significant disruption to services,\nreflecting the more discretionary nature of Ambius products and Brand Standards\u2019 exposure to the fast food\nsector, which also suffered from temporary business suspensions.\n276 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIncluding the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by \u00a343.8 million to \u00a3646.6\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3602.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and job\nrevenue increased by \u00a3109.1 million to \u00a3369.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3260.8 million\nin the year ended December 31, 2019 but these increases were partly offset by product revenue going down\nby \u00a319.9 million to \u00a3186.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3206.1 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. Job revenue benefited from disinfection revenue, which was introduced as a response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, of \u00a3142.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 (\u00a3nil in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019).\nEurope\nRevenue increased by \u00a318.1 million, or 2.3%, to \u00a3820.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a3802.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by Germany, which increased\nrevenues by \u00a313.1 million, or 12.1%, to \u00a3120.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3107.5 million\nin the year ended December 31, 2019 and Southern Europe, which increased by \u00a38.5 million, or 6.3%, to\n\u00a3143.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3134.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThese increases were partially offset by France revenues decreasing by \u00a37.2 million, or 2.3%, to \u00a3303.2\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3310.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThis revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2019 M&A of \u00a38.5 million and additional\nrevenue from 2020 M&A of \u00a38.7 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a34.0\nmillion adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Europe revenue\nincreased organically by \u00a34.9 million.\nThe Europe region saw a mixed impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. While some countries were less\nimpacted due to early and effective lock-downs, such as Germany, other regions, including France and parts\nof Southern Europe, were more severely impacted. In Latin America, while revenues in the Pest Control\nsegment declined, overall performance for the year was aided by disinfection sales. Including the impacts of\nM&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue fell by \u00a320.2 million to \u00a3635.7 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 from \u00a3655.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 but job revenue increased by\n\u00a348.1 million to \u00a3152.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3104.8 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. Hygiene & Wellbeing was the region\u2019s best performing segment, with good contributions\nfrom disinfection and products. The Pest Control segment delivered a robust performance in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, while France Workwear was most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, being particularly\naffected by temporary business closures in the hospitality and food services sector.\nUK & Sub Saharan Africa\nRevenue decreased by \u00a321.1 million, or 6.0%, to \u00a3327.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a3348.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was driven by UK, Ireland & Baltics\ndecreasing revenue by \u00a318.0 million, or 5.9%, to \u00a3288.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a3306.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and Sub Saharan Africa decreasing by \u00a33.1 million, or\n7.3%, to \u00a338.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a341.9 million in the year ended December 31,\n2019.\nThis revenue decrease included the incremental impact of 2019 M&A of \u00a30.5 million and additional revenue\nfrom 2020 M&A of \u00a30.9 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a34.6 million\nadverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, UK & Sub Saharan Africa\nrevenue fell organically by \u00a317.9 million.\nThe UK and Sub Saharan Africa region was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in\nApril 2020, which was the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic for Rentokil Initial. The Hygiene businesses in the\nUK and Ireland were unable to service customers within many sectors, but primarily the hospitality and food\nservices sector which was subjected to government restrictions and lock-downs throughout the year. The\nPest Control business in the UK also saw revenue declines in the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting\ntemporary business closures and suspensions. In contrast, the Specialist Hygiene, Medical and Products\nbusinesses performed well, benefiting from increased disinfection services.\n277 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDisinfection revenue, which was introduced as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, generated revenue of\n\u00a312.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Ambius and Property Care were severely impacted as a\nresult of customers cutting their spending on more discretionary services such as interior landscaping and\nplants, with Property Care further impacted by weakness in the UK commercial housing market. Overall, Job\nrevenue grew by \u00a36.7 million to \u00a399.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a393.0 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2019 and credit notes increased by \u00a327.8 million to \u00a332.2 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 from \u00a34.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAsia & MENAT\nRevenue increased by \u00a33.2 million, or 1.3%, to \u00a3263.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3260.1\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2019. This revenue increase was driven by Indonesia increasing\nrevenue by \u00a38.4 million, or 23.2%, to \u00a344.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a336.2 million in\nthe year ended December 31, 2019, Hong Kong increasing by \u00a33.5 million, or 18.1%, to \u00a322.8 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a319.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and Singapore\nimproving by \u00a31.9 million, or 7.1%, to \u00a329.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a327.7 million in\nthe year ended December 31, 2019. This was offset by a revenue decrease in India of \u00a312.8 million, or 20.8%,\nto \u00a348.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a361.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019\nand also in Malaysia of \u00a32.8 million, or 7.5%, to \u00a334.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a337.6\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThis revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2019 M&A of \u00a310.3 million and additional\nrevenue from 2020 M&A of \u00a33.2 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a38.1\nmillion adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Asia & MENAT\nrevenue fell organically by \u00a32.2 million.\nChina, Hong Kong and South Korea were among the first countries to be impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic and, as a result, were the first to recover, with strong demand for disinfection and hygiene product\nsales offsetting falls in contract revenue from other countries. Country performance across Asia was mixed in\nthe year ended December 31, 2020, with Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and Sri Lanka\nperforming well, but with India and Malaysia experiencing the worst impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIncluding the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue fell by \u00a34.3 million to \u00a3197.8 million in\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3202.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 but job revenue\nincreased by \u00a312.8 million to \u00a354.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a342.1 million in the year\nended December 31, 2019. Job revenue benefited from disinfection revenue of \u00a314.0 million, which was\nintroduced as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit notes increased by \u00a35.2 million to \u00a36.8 million in\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a31.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPacific\nRevenue decreased by \u00a38.3 million, or 4.5%, to \u00a3177.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a3185.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Australia revenue decreased by \u00a34.6 million, or 3.4%, to\n\u00a3131.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from \u00a3136.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019\nand New Zealand declined by \u00a32.9 million, or 6.3%, to \u00a343.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n\u00a346.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThis revenue decrease included the incremental impact of 2019 M&A of \u00a31.3 million and additional revenue\nfrom 2020 M&A of \u00a31.1 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a \u00a33.5 million\nadverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Pacific revenue fell\norganically by \u00a37.2 million.\nAll operations were impacted by the crisis as a result of government restrictions, particularly in New Zealand\nwhich entered into a lock-down in late March 2020. Pest Control revenue in the region fell by 3.2% in the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 and Hygiene declined by 6.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2019. Job revenue grew by \u00a31.8 million to \u00a329.8 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 from \u00a328.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the newly\nintroduced disinfection services, but product revenue decreased by \u00a31.4 million to \u00a36.2 million in the year\n278 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nended December 31, 2020 from \u00a37.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Management believes these measures provide valuable additional\ninformation for users of the Financial Statements in order to better understand the underlying trading\nperformance in the year from activities and businesses that will contribute to future performance. Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s internal strategic planning process is also based on these measures and they are used for incentive\npurposes. They should be viewed as complements to, and not replacements for, the comparable IFRS\nmeasures.\nConstant Exchange Rates (CER)\nGiven the international nature of Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations, foreign exchange movements can have a\nsignificant impact on the reported results of Rentokil Initial when they are translated into sterling (the\nfunctional currency of Rentokil Initial). In order to help understand the underlying trading performance of\nthe business, revenue and profit measures are often presented at CER. CER is calculated by translating\ncurrent-period reported numbers at the full-year average exchange rates for the prior year, in order to give\nmanagement and other users of the accounts better visibility of underlying trading performance against the\nprior period. The major exchange rates used for the comparisons between the six months ended June 30, 2022\nand June 30, 2021 are \u00a3/$ 1.3739 and \u00a3/\u200b\u20ac 1.1617. The major exchange rates used for the comparisons between\nthe years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are \u00a3/$ 1.2951 and \u00a3/\u200b\u20ac 1.1315. The major exchange\nrates used for the comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are \u00a3/$\n1.2790 and \u00a3/\u20ac 1.1419.\nOngoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating

Rentokil Initial\u2019s primary\nmarket risks include foreign currency exchange rate risks on transacting in multiple geographies around the\nworld and in repatriation of profits to the UK, and in interest rate risks on cost of financing. Rentokil Initial is\nexposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. Management regularly assesses and manages exposures\nto these risks through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by taking advantage of\nnatural hedges within us. Potential risks are discussed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risks\nRentokil Initial\u2019s worldwide operations generate profits and cash flows in foreign currencies. Sales and\npurchases are typically denominated in the currency of the country in which they are transacted, and cross-\nborder procurement is considered insignificant.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is in relation to the translation of assets and\nliabilities, and Rentokil Initial aims to hold debt in currencies in proportion to its forecast foreign currency\nprofits and investments. Foreign currency exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) derivatives are used to manage foreign currency\nexposures in excess of \u00a30.5 million (\u00a35.0 million for USD) that are not covered by debt or assets in the same\n(or another highly correlated) currency, as long as it makes sense from an economic perspective to do so.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s Treasury Committee monitors foreign exchange exposures on a monthly basis. Dealing in\nforeign exchange products is controlled by dealing mandates approved by the Treasury Committee and all\nFX transactions are covered by International Swap and Derivative Association documentation. The most\nsignificant foreign currency groups are U.S. dollars and euros, which make up 43.8% and 35.1% of operating\nprofit, respectively as of June 30, 2022 and 41.5% and 34.8% of operating profit, respectively as of December\n31, 2021.\nAt June 30, 2022, net debt was approximately 49% U.S. dollar, reflecting that it is the principal cash flow\nexposure, and 53% euro, with 2% net cash offset in other currencies. At December 31, 2021, net debt was\napproximately 57% U.S. dollar and 45% euro, with 2% net cash offset in other currencies. The translation of\nthe interest element of euro and U.S. dollar debt provides a partial income statement offset to the translation\nof earnings.\nAt each year end Rentokil Initial calculates the impact on the income statement and other comprehensive\nincome of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates. The principal foreign currency exposure is the euro. A\n10% movement in \u00a3/\u200b\u20ac would result in a \u00a315.6 million increase/decrease in operating profit, offset by a \u00a31.0\nmillion decrease/increase in interest payable. At December 31, 2021, for U.S. dollars, a 10% movement in \u00a3/$\nwould result in a \u00a319.4 million increase/decrease in operating profit, offset by a \u00a31.6 million decrease/\u200bincrease\nin interest payable. Where possible, currency cash flows are used to settle liabilities in the same currency in\npreference to selling currency in the market.\nInterest Rate Risks\nRentokil Initial seeks to manage interest rate risk to ensure reasonable certainty of its interest charge while\nallowing an element of risk exposure consistent with the variability of its cash flows. Interest rate risk is\nmanaged by the use of fixed interest debt and interest rate derivatives, which are approved in advance by the\nTreasury Committee. Rentokil Initial\u2019s policy is to fix a minimum of 50% of its estimated future interest rate\nexposures (excluding pensions) for a minimum period of 12 months forward. The Treasury Committee reviews\nthis exposure monthly. In fiscal 2021, Interbank Offered Rates Fallback Protocols were signed\n288 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwith the two banks that used to provide interest rate hedges that reference London Interbank Offered Rates\n(\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Rentokil Initial has no other LIBOR-based exposures.\nRentokil Initial had outstanding bond debt issues at June 30, 2022 with a market value of \u00a32,842.3 million.\nThis was below the book value of \u00a32,915.8 million. At December 31, 2021 the outstanding bond debt issues\nhad a market value of \u00a31,272.1 million. This exceeded the book value of \u00a31,253.7 million. There are no\ncircumstances where Rentokil Initial would be obliged to pay the fair market value. Rentokil Initial could,\nhowever, decide to redeem some or all of its bonds early and the fair market value is indicative of the price\nthat would be required to do so.\nAt December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 1.0% increase in euro interest rates would reduce the market value of\nthe existing bond liabilities by \u00a361.9 million. The income statement impact is nil as changes in interest rates\ndo not change the expected cash flows on the bonds.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAssumptions and estimation uncertainties\nRentokil Initial makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Estimates and assumptions are\ncontinually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of\nfuture events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nActual results may differ from these estimates and revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively.\nSensitivities to the estimates and assumptions are provided, where relevant, in Rentokil Initial\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this proxy statement/\u200bprospectus.\nThe estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying\namounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are listed below:\nimpairment of goodwill: growth rate and discount rate assumptions and forecast cash flow estimates\u037e\nincome taxes: key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of outflows in relation to tax\nprovisions\u037e and\nretirement benefits: key actuarial assumptions and estimates over future costs of winding up a\nscheme.\nFor further information, see Rentokil Initial\u2019s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nproxy statement/prospectus.\nImpairment of goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of Rentokil Initial\u2019s share of\nthe net identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisition\nof subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost\nless accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying\namount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to\ncash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to country of operation and reportable business unit. The\nrecoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow\nprojections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units\nhave been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates.\nDetails of Rentokil Initial\u2019s impairment review and sensitivities to changes in assumptions are disclosed in\ndetail in Rentokil Initial\u2019s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere\nin this proxy statement/prospectus.\nIncome taxes\nRentokil Initial is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\ndetermining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for\nwhich the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Rentokil Initial\n289 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrecognizes liabilities for anticipated settlement of tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes\nwill be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially\nrecorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such\ndetermination is made.\nRentokil Initial carries appropriate provision, based on best estimates, until tax computations are agreed with\nthe taxation authorities.\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except when\nthe tax relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with directly\nin equity.\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following temporary\ndifferences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill\u037e the initial recognition of assets or\nliabilities in transactions other than a business combination that at the time of the transactions affect neither\nthe accounting nor taxable profit or loss\u037e and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent\nthat they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred income tax is determined\nusing tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted (or substantively enacted) at the balance sheet date, and\nare expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax\nliability is settled. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when the timing differences relate to income\ntaxes levied by the same tax authority on an entity or different entities which are part of a tax consolidation\nand there would be the intention to settle on a net basis.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be\navailable against which the temporary differences can be utilized. The amount of deferred tax assets\nrecognized at each balance sheet date is adjusted to reflect changes in management\u2019s assessment of future\ntaxable profits. In recognizing the deferred tax asset in respect of losses, management has estimated the\nquantum of future taxable profits applying a risk weighting to future profits to reflect the uncertainties.\nCurrent tax is recognized based on the amounts expected to be paid or recovered under the tax rates and laws\nthat have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nRetirement benefits\nThe principal pension scheme in Rentokil Initial is the UK Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme (RIPS) which\nhas a defined contribution section, and a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new\nentrants and future accrual of benefits. The assets of the RIPS are legally separated from Rentokil Initial and\nthe Trustee of the RIPS is Rentokil Initial Pension Trustee Limited. The Trustee board comprises five\ncompany-nominated directors and three member-nominated directors. The Trustee is required by law to act in\nthe best interests of the members and beneficiaries of the RIPS and is responsible for setting certain policies\n(e.g., investment, contribution and indexation policies) of the scheme.\nThe defined benefit schemes of the RIPS are reappraised semi-annually by independent actuaries based\nupon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19R requirements (including schemes which are insured\nunder a buy-in contract).\nOn December 4, 2018 the Trustee entered into a binding agreement with Pension Insurance Corporation to\ninsure the liabilities of the RIPS, known as a buy-in. In December 2021 the final true-up premium was paid to\nPIC and on February 24, 2022 the insurance policy with PIC was transferred to the individual members of the\nscheme.\nThere remains some uncertainty regarding the final surplus that will be available to Rentokil Initial until all\nremaining Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) adjustments for members who transferred out of the scheme\nhave been settled and final scheme expenses have been paid. The remaining surplus recognized as a\nretirement benefit asset is management\u2019s estimate of the value that will be returned to Rentokil Initial when\nwind-up of the scheme completes, however this is based on estimates and assumptions as to which\n290 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmembers will be able to be traced, the value of GMP adjustments that will be made to these members, and the\ncost of future expenses incurred by the scheme between the balance sheet date and closure of the scheme.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards\nAs set out in Rentokil Initial\u2019s Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, Rentokil Initial has adopted the\nfollowing new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other\nstandards, with effect from January 1, 2022:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use\u202f-\u202fAmendments to IAS 16\nOnerous Contracts\u202f-\u202fCost of Fulfilling a Contract\u202f-\u202fAmendments to IAS 37\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\nReference to the Conceptual Framework\u202f-\u202fAmendments to IFRS 3.\nThe application of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures of the amounts\nrecognized in Rentokil Initial\u2019s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included\nelsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. Consequently, no adjustment has been made to the\ncomparative financial information at June 30, 2021, or December 31, 2020. Rentokil Initial has not early\nadopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.\n291 \n",

            "text": "Introduction\nInformation regarding the remuneration provided to Rentokil Initial\u2019s Directors, Executive Directors and ELT\nhas been split into multiple sections for ease of reference. This introductory section provides an overview of\nRentokil Initial\u2019s Remuneration Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) and the activities undertaken during the year.\nThe sections beginning with the section entitled \u201c- Directors\u2019 Remuneration in the Year Ending December\n31, 2021\u201d, beginning on page 300, provide an explanation of how the Policy was implemented during 2021\nand shows the alignment between Rentokil Initial\u2019s strategy, remuneration framework and performance, as\nwell as the payments made to Directors, Executive Directors and ELT members during this period and\ninformation on the shareholdings of Rentokil Initial\u2019s Directors, Executive Directors and ELT members. For\nreference, a summary of the Policy is included in the section entitled \u201c- Summary of Rentokil Initial\u2019s 2021\nDirectors\u2019 Remuneration Policy\u201d, beginning on page 316.\nRemuneration Committee Responsibilities\nThe Committee\u2019s main responsibilities are developing and setting the Policy and overseeing its application.\nIt determines and agrees the policy with the Rentokil Initial board of directors and approves individual\nremuneration arrangements for Rentokil Initial\u2019s Chairman, Executive Directors and members of the ELT. It\nreviews executive performance and strives to ensure that remuneration structures align the interests of\nmanagement with those of shareholders and operate in the long-term best interests of Rentokil Initial.\nThe Committee oversees contractual terms on termination affecting Executive Directors and members of the\nELT, and seeks to ensure that any payments made are both fair to the individual and to Rentokil Initial, that\nfailure is not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised. The Committee also oversees\nRentokil Initial\u2019s incentive schemes, including the operation and effectiveness of performance measures and\ntargets in both the annual bonus plan and the Performance Share Plan (\u201cPSP\u201d). It also lends oversight to\nmajor changes in employee remuneration across the Rentokil Initial group.\nMembership and Attendance\nDuring 2021, the Committee members were:\nCathy Turner (appointed Chair on May 12, 2021)\nSarosh Mistry, appointed April 1, 2021\nJulie Southern\nLinda Yueh\nAngela Seymour-Jackson (resigned as Non-Executive Director and Chair on May 12, 2021)\nThe number of scheduled Committee meetings in 2021 returned to the usual level of four meetings per year\nfollowing the increase to five in 2020 to support the review of the Policy. The Rentokil Initial HR\n297 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nDirector, the Rentokil Initial General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Rentokil Initial Deputy Company\nSecretary (who acts as secretary to the Committee) and the Rentokil Initial Head of Reward also attend\nCommittee meetings.\nThe Rentokil Initial HR Director has direct access to the Chair of the Committee and, together with the\nRentokil Initial Head of Reward, advises the Committee on remuneration matters relating to Executive\nDirectors and members of the ELT. Rentokil Initial\u2019s Chairman also attends meetings and makes\nrecommendations in relation to the remuneration and incentive arrangements for the Chief Executive. The\nChief Executive attends meetings and makes recommendations in respect of remuneration arrangements for\nhis direct reports. No Executive Director or member of the ELT is present when their own remuneration is\nunder consideration.\nThe Committee members have a broad and diverse set of skills and knowledge that, when combined, bring\nthe necessary level of experience and know-how to ensure that remuneration matters are dealt with in a\nbalanced, independent and informed manner. No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest\nin the matters to be decided by the Committee, other than as a shareholder. No member of the Committee has\nany conflict of interest in carrying out their role on the Committee arising from other directorships nor does\nany member participate in any of Rentokil Initial\u2019s incentive or pension arrangements or have any\ninvolvement in the day-to-day running of Rentokil Initial.\nIn order to avoid any conflict of interest, remuneration is managed through well-defined processes ensuring\nno individual is involved in the decision-making process related to their own remuneration. The Committee\nalso receives support from external advisors and evaluates the support provided by those advisors annually\nto ensure that advice is independent, appropriate and cost-effective.\nRemuneration Committee Effectiveness\nThe Committee undertook a review of its performance during 2021 as part of the broader external Rentokil\nInitial board of directors evaluation. The review concluded that the Committee continued to operate\neffectively. The Committee Chair succession process was regarded as exemplary and very smooth. The\nreview also rated the current composition of the Committee as excellent and concluded that discussions held\ncovered all key areas and enabled positive input from Committee members.\nExternal Advisors\nMaterial advice and/or services were provided to the Committee during 2021 by FIT Remuneration\nConsultants LLP (FIT) who are retained to provide independent advice on executive remuneration matters\nand on Rentokil Initial\u2019s long-term incentive arrangements. FIT was appointed on November 6, 2018 by the\nCommittee following a review of its advisors. FIT is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and\nadheres to its code in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. Fees charged during the year\nfor advice to the Committee by FIT were \u00a322,466 and were accrued on a time and materials basis. FIT also\nacts as remuneration advisor to the remuneration committees of Trustpilot A/S, which Angela Seymour-\nJackson chairs, and Aldermore, which Cathy Turner chairs. However, the Committee is satisfied that this has\nnot impaired their independence in any way. FIT has no other material connections with Rentokil Initial or\nany Director, and the Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective. FIT did\nnot provide any other services during the year.\n298 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nActivities of the Remuneration Committee\nIn 2021, the Committee considered the following key areas:\nMatters considered\nDiscussion and outcome\nExecutive remuneration\nExecutive Director remuneration\nThe Committee considered and approved base\nsalaries for 2021, bonus outcomes for 2020, bonus\nstructure for 2021 and the 2021 PSP awards and\ntargets for the Executive Directors, taking into\nconsideration the wider workforce.\nExecutive Leadership Team (ELT) remuneration\nThe Committee considered and approved base\nsalaries for 2021, bonus outcomes for 2020, bonus\nstructure for 2021, and the 2021 PSP awards and\ntargets for the members of the ELT, taking into\nconsideration the wider workforce remuneration.\n2018 Performance Share Plan (PSP) vest\nThe Committee approved the vesting of the 2018 PSP\nawards as a result of the performance measures\nbeing met at 85.97% of maximum.\n2021 PSP award\nThe Committee approved the PSP grant in March\n2021 and its performance conditions, and\nsubsequently noted a summary of the grants made\nunder the PSP.\nPSP measures\nThe Committee monitored the performance status of\nthe outstanding awards under the PSP.\n2022 annual bonus\nThe Committee reviewed the overall structure of the\n2022 annual bonus plan for Executive Directors and\nELT members.\n2021 Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy\nThe Committee considered and agreed to the\nstructure and content of the new policy that was\ntaken forward for shareholder approval at the 2021\nAGM.\nShareholder engagement\nThe Committee engaged with shareholders on the\nPolicy and considered the feedback received.\nELT appointments\nThe Committee approved the remuneration for the\nappointment of the new Rentokil Initial Group\nGeneral Counsel and the Regional Managing\nDirector for Asia & MENAT.\nELT retirements\nThe Committee considered the leaving arrangements\nof the Rentokil Initial Group General Counsel &\nCompany Secretary and the Regional Managing\nDirector Asia.\nGovernance and oversight\nShare dilution limits\nThe Committee noted the impact of Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nexecutive share plans on share dilution limits.\nTerms of reference\nThe Committee undertook its annual review of its\nterms of reference.\nPerformance review\nThe Committee undertook its annual review of the\neffectiveness of the Committee.\n299 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nMatters considered\nDiscussion and outcome\nCorporate governance \nand proxy voting guidelines\nThe Committee received an update during 2021 on\nchanges in corporate governance and proxy voting\nguidelines.\nGender Pay Report\nThe Committee considered and approved the 2020\nGender Pay Report in February 2021, which was\npublished in March 2021.\nDirectors\u2019 Remuneration Report\nThe Committee reviewed and approved the\nDirectors\u2019 Remuneration Report to be included in\nRentokil Initial\u2019s 2020 Annual Report.\nAnnual planner\nThe Committee considered the annual planner for\n2022.\nThe Chair of the Committee presents a summary of material matters discussed at each meeting to the\nfollowing Rentokil Initial board of directors meeting and minutes of the Committee meetings are circulated to\nall Directors.

            "text": "Annual Bonus 2021\nContext of Business Performance\nRentokil Initial had an outstanding year in 2021, growing ongoing revenue by 9.9% and ongoing operating\nprofit by 19.5%. These results were not just outstanding in comparison to 2020, they are outstanding\ncompared to pre-COVID levels with ongoing revenue growth of 16.8% compared to 2019 and ongoing\noperating profit growth of 26.3%.\nDespite this the Committee still gave careful consideration as to whether or not the outcomes for the annual\nbonus were reflective of overall Rentokil Initial performance, in both the context of the year in question and\npre-pandemic levels, when the performance was reviewed against the targets. The Committee also assessed\nthat the targets set were truly stretching, given the level of outperformance, and determined that they were\nas the maximum targets were set well above the guidance of 3%-4% ongoing revenue growth and c.10%\nongoing operating profit growth, with requirements to achieve above c.8% and c.14% growth, respectively.\nThe results were also considered in the context of wider stakeholders and it was deemed that no discretion\nshould be applied to adjust the outcome. This is due to remuneration returning to normal for colleagues of all\nlevels with no requirements to make any temporary reductions to Rentokil Initial\u2019s colleagues remuneration\nin 2021. There were no requirements to access government support in the UK and Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nshareholders have also shared in this success, as Rentokil Initial returned to paying dividends in 2021, with\nshareholders receiving 5.41p in May and 2.09p in September. Both dividend payments were significantly\nabove 2019 levels. The price per Rentokil Initial ordinary share also continued to grow throughout 2021,\nending 14.6% higher at the end of the year, having grown from 509.6p to 584.0p year on year.\n2021 Annual Bonus Outcome\nThe Committee reviewed the 2021 bonus plan outcome for Rentokil Initial\u2019s senior management population\nbased on the targets set at the start of the financial year. The bonus plan supports delivery of Rentokil\nbased on the targets set at the start of the financial year. The bonus plan supports delivery of Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s strategic priorities.\n301 \u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe annual bonus plan comprises three parts: gateway measures, company performance and personal\nperformance. This means that bonuses earned reflect the performance of the constituent businesses which\nmake up the overall company performance as well as achievement against specific personal objectives. The\ngateway measures and company performance are measured against financial targets. The Executive Directors\nhad a maximum bonus opportunity of 150% of salary if Rentokil Initial\u2019s financial targets are achieved in full\nand an opportunity to earn up to 30% based on personal performance, which is measured through Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s performance and development review process. In total, the maximum bonus opportunity is up to\n180% of salary.\nApplication of Discretion\nThe Committee has not applied discretion to the outcome of the annual bonus as the outcome is felt fair in\nthe context of Rentokil Initial\u2019s performance and experience of wider stakeholders. The table below details\nthe key achievements for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, which were used to determine their\nperformance rating.\nGateway Measures\nFor any bonus to be payable to an Executive Director, two gateway measures had to be met as follows:\nProfit Gateway: Rentokil Initial must achieve at least 95% of the ongoing operating profit target of\n\u00a3431.5m, which is \u00a3409.9m. The outcome was \u00a3469.0m.\nFree Cash Flow Gateway: Rentokil Initial must achieve free cash flow generation of \u00a3205m. The outcome\nwas \u00a3331.5m.\nBoth gateways were achieved for 2021.\nCompany Performance Measures\nExecutive Directors\u2019 bonuses were determined by achievement against two independent financial measures:\nongoing revenue and ongoing operating profit (before restructuring costs) performance. These measures\nwere given equal weighting.\nThe targets used to assess ongoing revenue performance are disclosed below, along with the achievement\nagainst these targets, which was calculated on the same basis as the targets were set.\nThreshold\n\u00a3\u2019000\nTarget \n\u00a3\u2019000\nMaximum\n\u00a3\u2019000\nResult \n\u00a3\u2019000\nTargets\n2,977.3\n3,007.1\n3,037.5\n3,087.6\nTargets as % of on-target\n99\n100\n101\n102.7\n% of maximum bonus opportunity\n10\n50\n100\n100\nThe targets used to assess ongoing operating profit performance are disclosed below, along with the\nachievement against these targets, which was calculated on the same basis as the targets were set.\nThreshold\n\u00a3\u2019000\nTarget \n\u00a3\u2019000\nMaximum\n\u00a3\u2019000\nResult \n\u00a3\u2019000\nTargets\n\u2007\u2007409.9\n\u2007\u2007431.5\n\u2007\u2007453.1\n\u2007\u2007469.0\nTargets as % of on-target\n95\n100\n105\n108.7\n% of maximum bonus opportunity\n10\n50\n100\n100\nThe table shows the bonus outcome for company performance for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial\nOfficer and the amount payable.\nOngoing \nrevenue\n(50% \nweighting)\nOngoing \noperating \nprofit\n(50% \nweighting)\nBonus\noutcome \nas % of\nsalary \nfor company\nelement\nBonus\noutcome \nfor company \nelement\n\u00a3\u2019000\nAndy Ransom\n75\n75\n150\n1,312.5\nStuart Ingall-Tombs\n75\n75\n150\n778.4\n302 \n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPersonal Performance\nThe Executive Directors can earn up to 30% of base salary based on their personal performance against\nobjectives measured through Rentokil Initial\u2019s performance and development review (PDR) process and\nobjectives typically include areas such as people, customers, safety, systems, governance & control, and\nkey strategic projects.\nThe table shows the potential bonus opportunity for each PDR rating.\nPerformance rating and definition\n1: \nBelow \nstandards\nrequired\n2: \nDevelopment\nrequired\n3: \nGood \nperformer\n4: \nExceeds \nexpectations\n5: \nOutstanding\n% bonus opportunity\n0\n0\n15\n22.5\n30\nThe performance rating awarded to the Chief Executive is a 5 rating resulting in a bonus of 30% of salary.\nThe performance rating for the Chief Financial Officer was a 4 rating resulting in a bonus of 22.5% of salary.\nThe assessment of the performance ratings, by the Chairman for the Chief Executive and by the Chief\nExecutive for the Chief Financial Officer, took into account their key achievements during 2021 as detailed in\nthe table below.\nTotal bonus outcome\nThe table shows the total bonus outcome for each Executive Director.

            "text": "Rentokil Initial Remuneration in Context\nWider Workforce Policy\nDuring 2021, Rentokil Initial had approximately 46,000 colleagues based in 88 countries. Rentokil Initial has a\nbroad remuneration policy which reflects the diversity of cultures, legislative environments, employment\nmarkets and the types and seniority of roles that this geographic spread requires. Rentokil Initial structures\nits employee reward to enable us to recruit and retain the right people, doing the right job for its customers.\n313 \n(8)\n(9)\n(10)A\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRentokil Initial believes that its relationship with its colleagues is generally good, as evidenced by its high\nengagement scores. The majority of Rentokil Initial\u2019s colleagues are not represented by any labor union.\nHowever, labor agreements are common in some countries around the world and Rentokil Initial recognises\nsuch arrangements and works closely with the applicable work councils. Rentokil Initial recognises unions\nand/or follows Collective Labour Agreements in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Turkey, Austria,\nBelgium, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,\nGuadeloupe, Martenique, Eswatini, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and India. These agreements are typically\nnational agreements and cover blue collar workers. Rentokil Initial has not experienced any strike action that\nsignificantly influenced its business activities.\nCEO Pay Ratio\nThe CEO pay ratio compares Rentokil Initial\u2019s Chief Executive\u2019s single figure earnings to the single figure\nearnings of UK colleagues. It has been calculated using method A, where the colleagues at each quartile are\nidentified using details of their full-time equivalent pay and benefits for the year being measured. The\neffective date for the calculation is the December 31 of the reporting year. For example, the 2021 colleague\nfigures represent the full-time equivalent pay and benefits for 2021 for colleagues employed on December 31,\n2021 and is calculated once the actual data is available, which means that no elements of pay are omitted or\ndepartures required from the methodology. This method was chosen as it best replicates the Chief\nExecutive\u2019s single figure.\nThe table below shows the ratios at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile for 2021, 2020, 2019 and\n2018:\nYear\nMethod\n25th\npercentile \npay ratio\nMedian\npay \nratio\n75th\npercentile \npay ratio\n2021\n281:1\n232:1\n172:1\n\u00a3\n21,385\n\u00a3 25,894\n\u00a3\n34,910\n2020\nA\n203:1\n160:1\n111:1\n\u00a3\n19,959\n\u00a3 25,379\n\u00a3\n36,452\n2019\nA\n220:1\n173:1\n119:1\n\u00a3\n20,695\n\u00a3 26,348\n\u00a3\n38,169\n2018\nA\n229:1\n189:1\n145:1\n\u00a3\n21,644\n\u00a3 26,262\n\u00a3\n34,318\nThe ratios are significantly higher in 2021 than 2020. There are three key reasons:\nthe Chief Executive\u2019s pay has returned to normal levels following 2020 in which he received no bonus,\na lower PSP vesting level and waived his salary in Q2 2020\u037e\nthe acquisition of the Cannon Hygiene business has increased the number of hygiene technicians,\nwhich has reduced the pay of Rentokil Initial\u2019s benchmark colleagues\u037e and\nprice per Rentokil Initial ordinary share has risen 90% between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2021,\nwhich means the PSP element of the CEO\u2019s package has significantly increased in value over this\ntime, due to share price appreciation.\nIt is anticipated that variations in the PSP and annual bonus outcomes will have the biggest impact on the\nratios over time. For PSP, this is due to vesting levels and the share price changing. For the annual bonus,\nalthough Rentokil Initial\u2019s comparator colleagues are also eligible for a bonus, the Chief Executive is targeted\non company-level outcomes, whereas its comparator colleagues are based on their specific remit, which\ngiven that the UK makes up only a small percentage of the company, means the outcomes may vary from\nyear to year.\nThe median pay ratio is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for Rentokil Initial\u2019s UK\ncolleagues taken as a whole. Rentokil Initial has a consistent approach to reward across the Rentokil Initial\ngroup, and colleagues\u2019 packages are set with reference to the external market.\n314 \n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGender Pay Gap\nRentokil Initial continues to have no material gender pay gap between men and women, with a median of -4%\nand a mean -8%, which is significantly better than the UK average of 15.4% reported by the Office for\nNational Statistics, and means the median woman earns more than the equivalent man.\nThese are encouraging results overall, and Rentokil Initial is steadily increasing the number of women in\nsenior roles. In addition, Rentokil Initial\u2019s reputation as an Employer of Choice has continued to grow with a\nsignificant number of female external hires.\nRentokil Initial continues to be focused on making Rentokil Initial an even more diverse and inclusive place\nto work and in 2021 rolled out a global diversity, equality and inclusion upskilling programme for all middle\nand senior management across the world, covering around 1,000 employees.\nRentokil Initial\u2019s key areas of focus continue to be increasing the number of female frontline technicians and\nimproving the proportion of females in senior manager roles in both its head office functions and its\noperations.\nRelative Importance of Spend on Pay\nThe table below sets out amounts paid by Rentokil Initial in total employee costs and total dividends paid\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n2021\n\u00a3m\n2020\n\u00a3m\n%\nchange\nRemuneration paid to all colleagues of the Rentokil Initial group\n1,404.9\n\u00a31,304.9\n7.7\nDistributions to shareholders\n138.7\n-\n100\nThe average number of people employed by Rentokil Initial during the year was 46,031 in 2021 and\n44,588 in 2020.\nPercentage Change in Remuneration\nThe table below sets out a comparison of the change in pay versus the previous year for the Chief Executive,\nChief Financial Officer, Chairman, Non-Executive Directors and colleagues of Rentokil Initial for 2020 and\n2021.\nThe percentage changes calculated on the actual remuneration received are distorted by two factors: firstly,\ninitiatives undertaken in 2020 to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, such as pay waivers in Q2 2020 and\ncancelling the annual bonus scheme, have impacted the percentage changes\u037e and secondly, the actual\nremuneration received is not adjusted for in-year starters and leavers.\nTo give a clearer picture, a \u201c\u2018like for like\u2019\u201d comparison has also been included, which includes adjustments to\ncorrect the above distortions\u037e for example, by removing the impact of the pay waivers from base salary.\nHowever, the bonus payments are still impacted by COVID-19.\n315 \n(1)\n(1)\n%\n%",

However, higher increases may be\nawarded in certain circumstances, where the Committee considers this\nappropriate, such as:\nwhere a new Executive Director has been appointed to the Rentokil Initial\nboard of directors at a lower than typical market salary to allow for growth in\nthe role, then larger increases may be awarded in following years to move\nsalary positioning closer to typical market levels as the executive grows in\nexperience, subject to performance\u037e\nwhere the Executive Director has been promoted or has had a change in\nresponsibilities, salary increases in excess of the above level may be\nawarded\u037e or\na substantial change in Rentokil Initial\u2019s size or market capitalisation leading\nto the positioning of an Executive Director\u2019s salary falling behind market\npractice.\nIn exceptional circumstances, where a Non-Executive Director temporarily takes\nup an executive position, salary increases for the Non-Executive Director may\nbe awarded as appropriate.\nPerformance measures and\nperiod\nThe payment of salary is not dependent on achieving performance targets\nalthough individual performance is taken into account when setting salary\nlevels and determining any salary increases.\n317 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPension\nPurpose/link to strategy\nTo facilitate Executive Directors\u2019 planning for retirement.\nOperation\nExecutive Director pension arrangements are by way of a defined contribution\narrangement or through a cash alternative of a similar value or a combination of\nthe two.\nLevels of payout\nFor the current Chief Financial Officer and any future Executive Director hires\nthe maximum contribution will be in line with the wider workforce in the UK,\nwhich is currently 3% of base salary although this rate may change from time to\ntime.\nThe maximum contribution for the Chief Executive has been frozen at the cash\namount paid in 2019, when the Policy in force at the time was 25% of salary and\nis currently equivalent to 21.9% of base salary. This cash amount will be\nreduced to be in line with the maximum contribution for the wider workforce in\nthe UK at the end of 2022.\nPerformance measures and\nperiod\nNot applicable.\nBenefits\nPurpose/link to strategy\nTo provide market-competitive benefits that support the executive to undertake\ntheir role.\nOperation\nRentokil Initial pays the cost of providing the benefits on a monthly, annual or\none-off basis. Benefits are determined taking into account market practice, the\nlevel and type of benefits provided throughout the Rentokil Initial group and\nindividual circumstances. All benefits are non-pensionable. The main benefits\nfor Executive Directors are:\nlife assurance\u037e\ncar or car allowance\u037e\nfamily healthcare\u037e\npermanent health insurance\u037e and\nrelocation benefits\u202f-\u202fin the event that an executive were required to relocate\nto undertake their role, the Committee may provide an additional appropriate\nlevel of benefits to reflect the relevant circumstances.

The Committee retains\nthe discretion to change the benefits provided (including offering additional\nbenefits) in line with market practice and may include offering participation in\nany future all employee share plan.\nLevels of payout\nLevels of benefits are set in line with market practice.

If nil-cost options remain exercisable at the tenth anniversary of\ngrant then they will be exercised automatically on a participant\u2019s behalf.\nThe Committee retains the right to exercise discretion to ensure that the level of\nbonus payable is appropriate and a fair reflection of Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nperformance.\nMalus and clawback rules apply to both cash bonus payments and DBP awards\n(see Malus and Clawback section for details).\nDeferred shares may be adjusted in accordance with the rules in the event of a\nvariation of Rentokil Initial\u2019s share capital, demerger, special dividend or similar\nevent that materially affects the price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.\nLevels of payout\nBonus payouts start to accrue at a level of up to 20% of base salary for meeting\nthreshold levels of performance and a maximum opportunity of 180% of base\nsalary, with an on-target bonus opportunity of no more than 50% of the\nmaximum opportunity. Payouts for performance levels in between these levels\nwill typically be paid on a straight-line basis.\nDividend equivalents accrue between grant date and vesting date on shares\nthat vest under the DBP and are normally settled in the form of additional\nshares.\nPerformance measures and\nperiod\nThe annual bonus is normally based on the achievement of financial targets\nand/or personal objectives, although the Committee may include other strategic\npriorities. Performance is typically tested over a one-year performance period.\nThe Committee reserves the right to set appropriate measures that ensure\nalignment with business strategy and shareholder interest, subject to the\nfinancial measures accounting for at least 75% of the total.\nFinancial measures may be linked to Rentokil Initial group performance or the\nExecutive\u2019s specific area of responsibility, if appropriate.\n319 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPerformance Share Plan (PSP)\nPurpose/link to strategy\nTo motivate and incentivise delivery of stretching business performance over\nthe long term and to create alignment with growth in value for shareholders.\nTo act as a retention tool for Executive Directors.\nOperation\nThe PSP operates under the rules approved by shareholders in 2016 (and as\namended).\nAn award of shares is granted on an annual basis with a face value in line with\nthe multiple of base salary approved by the Committee, with vesting subject to\nthe achievement of performance conditions.\nShares awarded under the PSP are typically awarded as nil-cost options\n(although may be structured in other ways) and have an exercise period that\nextends from the date of vesting to the tenth anniversary of the award being\nmade. If nil-cost options remain exercisable at the tenth anniversary of grant\nthen they will be exercised automatically on a participant\u2019s behalf.\nAward levels and performance conditions are set to support the business\u2019 long-\nterm goals and seek to reflect market practice and shareholder guidance.\nAwards are subject to a two-year holding period post vesting. Directors may\nsell sufficient shares to pay taxes due related to the award, if required, during\nthis period.\nMalus and clawback rules apply to shares awarded under the PSP (see Malus\nand Clawback section for details).\nAwards may be adjusted in accordance with the rules in the event of a variation\nof Rentokil\u2019s share capital, demerger, special dividend or similar event that\nmaterially affects the price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.\nLevels of payout\nThe maximum regular annual award will be 375% of base salary for the Chief\nExecutive and 300% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer and any other\nExecutive Directors. This increase in award will be implemented on a phased\nbasis, with the CEO receiving 325% of salary (75% of salary increase) in the\nyear ending December 31, 2021 (Year 1). The CFO will receive an award of 200%\nof salary (this remains at the current level) in Year 1, while he settles into the\nrole and gains experience. No more than 20% of the award shall vest for meeting\nthreshold levels of performance and 100% of the award shall vest if maximum\nperformance is achieved. Performance between these points will typically be\nmeasured on a straight-line basis.\nDividend equivalents may accrue between grant date and vesting date or to the\nend of the holding period on shares that vest under the PSP and are normally\nsettled in the form of additional shares.\n320 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPerformance measures and\nperiod\nAwards are subject to the achievement of financial and ESG/strategic measures,\nwith specific measures and weightings set by the Committee each year to\nensure alignment with the business strategy at the time of grant. However, a\nminimum weighting of 75% should relate to financial (including TSR) measures.\nPotential measures include:\nrelative TSR performance\u037e\norganic revenue growth\u037e\nfree cash flow conversion\u037e and\nESG measures (employee retention, customer satisfaction and vehicle fuel\nintensity).\nIf events happen which cause the Committee to consider that a performance\ncondition would not, without alteration, achieve its original purpose, it may\namend that performance condition provided that the amended performance\ncondition is materially no less challenging than it would have been had the\nevent not occurred.\nThe Committee retains the right to exercise discretion to ensure that the\nformulaic vesting outcome is appropriate and a fair reflection of Rentokil\nInitial\u2019s performance.\nShareholding guidelines\nPurpose/link to strategy\nEncourages greater levels of shareholding and aligns Executive Directors\u2019\ninterests with those of shareholders.\nOperation\nExecutive Directors are expected to achieve and maintain a holding of Rentokil\nInitial ordinary shares.\nA further post-cessation shareholding requirement will normally apply to\nExecutive Directors (see Termination section for details).

Targets are set each year based on stretching internal budgets and achieving or exceeding\nthese targets will both return value to shareholders and reward the executive team for delivery.\nThe annual bonus measures are reviewed annually to focus on delivery of key financial targets and strategic\ngoals for the forthcoming year, as well as key strategic or operational goals relevant to the individual. Over\nthe long term, PSP performance measures are focused on generating returns to shareholders through the\nrelative TSR measure and other measures focus on improving business performance.\n321 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nMalus and Clawback\nMalus and clawback rules apply to the Executive Directors\u2019 incentive arrangements.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for the year then ended in conformity with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the\nPCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment assessment of goodwill\nAs described in Note B2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recorded \u00a31,844.2 million of\ngoodwill at 31 December 2021. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less\naccumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-\ngenerating units (CGUs) identified according to country of operation and reportable business unit. The\nrecoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow\nprojections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate. The cash flow projections in year one are based on\nfinancial budgets approved by management, which are prepared as part of the Group\u2019s normal planning\nprocess. Cash flows for years two to five use management\u2019s expectation of sales growth, operating costs and\nmargin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for\nF-2",

If the certificate of\nincorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in\nsubsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.\n(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\nIf a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this\nsection is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less\nthan 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the\nrecord date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance\nwith \u00a7 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available\npursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or\nall of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of\nthis section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7\n114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s\nshares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or\nconsolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a\ndemand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an\ninformation processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice.\nSuch demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the\nstockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such\nstockholder\u2019s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute\nsuch a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written\ndemand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or\nconsolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each\nconstituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of\nor consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has\nbecome effective\u037e or\nIf the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \u00a7 228, \u00a7 251(h), \u00a7 253, or \u00a7 267 of\nthis title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify\neach of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are\nentitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal\nrights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent\ncorporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the\nconstituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Such notice\nmay, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also\nnotify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any\nstockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such\nnotice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, within the later\nof the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the\ndate of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the\nappraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a demand may be delivered to the\ncorporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if\nany) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it\nreasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the\nstockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If such notice\ndid not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each\nsuch constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the\nmerger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such\nconstituent corporation that is entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger\nor consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice\nto all such holders on or\nC-2 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwithin 10 days after such effective date\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is\nsent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger\napproved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the\noffer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first\nnotice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal\nrights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares in accordance with this\nsubsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the\ncorporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the\nabsence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of\ndetermining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation\nmay fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the\nnotice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the\nmerger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed\nand the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of\nbusiness on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.\n(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting\ncorporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and\nwho is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in\nthe Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding\nas a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nterms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this\nsection hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled\nto receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting\nforth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a\nmerger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded\nstock (as defined in \u00a7 251 (h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and\naccepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251 (h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to\nwhich demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such\nstatement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request for such a\nstatement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the\nperiod for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.\nNotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock\nheld either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a\npetition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the\nsurviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the\nRegister in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses\nof all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value\nof their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed\nby the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The\nRegister in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing\nof such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the\nstockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more\npublications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in\nthe City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices\nby mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation.\n(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this\nsection and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have\ndemanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit\nC-3 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntheir certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal\nproceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the\nproceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class\nor series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a\nnational securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who\nare otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds\n1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration\nprovided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger\nwas approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing\nappraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or\nconsolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In\ndetermining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its\ndiscretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest\nfrom the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded\nquarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of\npayment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving\ncorporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall\naccrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so\npaid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless\npaid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled\nto participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal\nprior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name\nappears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section\nand who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is\nrequired, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not\nentitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each\nsuch stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares\nrepresented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock.\nThe Court\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether\nsuch surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.\n(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court\ndeems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion\nof the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the\nvalue of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.\n(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded\nappraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any\npurpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided\nin subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation\na written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or\nconsolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in\nsubsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of\nsuch stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the\nCourt of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such\napproval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just\u037e provided, however that this\nprovision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal\nC-4 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of\nthe merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.\n(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders\nwould have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nC-5 \n",

            "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Rentokil Initial plc\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Rentokil Initial plc and its subsidiaries\n(the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statement of profit or loss and other\ncomprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement\nfor the year then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial\nstatements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for the year then ended in conformity with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the\nPCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment assessment of goodwill\nAs described in Note B2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recorded \u00a31,844.2 million of\ngoodwill at 31 December 2021. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less\naccumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-\ngenerating units (CGUs) identified according to country of operation and reportable business unit. The\nrecoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow\nprojections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate. The cash flow projections in year one are based on\nfinancial budgets approved by management, which are prepared as part of the Group\u2019s normal planning\nprocess. Cash flows for years two to five use management\u2019s expectation of sales growth, operating costs and\nmargin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for\nF-2 TABLE OF CONTENTS\neach CGU. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates\n(LTGR). Management\u2019s key assumptions in the recoverable amount calculation are LTGR, terminal operating\nmargin and pre-tax discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment\nassessment for goodwill is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment from management when\ndeveloping the recoverable amount of the CGUs, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity,\ncomplexity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions related\nto terminal operating margins (including sales growth, operating costs and margin), the LTGR and pre-tax\ndiscount rates\u037e and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialised skill and\nknowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among\nothers (i) testing management\u2019s process for developing the recoverable amount\u037e (ii) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the recoverable amount calculation\u037e (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of\nunderlying data\u037e and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management\nrelating to the sales growth, operating costs and margin, LTGR and pre-tax discount rate. Evaluating\nmanagement\u2019s assumptions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were\nreasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the CGU\u037e (ii) the consistency with external\nmarket and industry data\u037e and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in\nother areas of the audit. Professionals with specialised skill and knowledge were used to assist in the\nevaluation of the management\u2019s recoverable amount calculation and the pre-tax discount rate assumption.\nValuation of customer lists and other intangible assets acquired in the year\nAs described in Note B1 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended 31 December 2021\nthe Group purchased 100% of the share capital or trade and assets of 52 companies and businesses for a\ntotal consideration of \u00a3313.7 million. Goodwill of \u00a3230.6 million and customer lists and other intangible assets\ntotaling \u00a370.7 million were recorded. Customer lists and other intangible assets are recognised at their fair\nvalue at the date of acquisition using an income-based approach, which involves the use of assumptions\nincluding customer termination rates, profit margins, contributory asset charges and discount rates. The use\nof these assumptions requires estimation in the valuation approach.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ncustomer lists and other intangible assets acquired in the year is a critical audit matter are: (i) significant\njudgment by management in determining the fair values\u037e (ii) a high level of auditor judgment, subjectivity,\nand effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions related to\ncustomer termination rates, profit margins, contributory asset charges and discount rates\u037e and (iii) the audit\neffort involved the use of professionals with specialised skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among\nothers (i) testing management\u2019s process for estimating the fair value of intangible assets\u037e (ii) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the valuation methods\u037e (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by\nmanagement\u037e and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to customer\ntermination rates, profit margins, contributory asset charges and the discount rate for the intangible assets.\nProfessionals with specialised skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the discount\nrates.\nValuation of retirement benefit obligations\nAs described in Note A10 to the consolidated financial statements, at 31 December 2021, the UK Rentokil\nInitial 2015 Pension Scheme (RIPS) has a surplus of \u00a318.2 million, comprising defined benefit obligations of\n\u00a31,247.5 million and plan assets of \u00a31,265.7 million. The principal pension scheme in the Group is the RIPS\nwhich has a defined contribution section, and a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to\nnew entrants and future accrual of benefits. The defined benefit schemes of the RIPS are reappraised semi-\nannually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance\nF-3 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwith IAS 19R requirements (including schemes which are insured under a buy-in contract). The assumptions\nused for the RIPS are discount rate, future salary increases, future pension increases, RPI inflation, CPI\ninflation and mortality rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\nretirement benefit obligations is a critical audit matter are: (i) significant judgment by management in\ndeveloping the estimate\u037e (ii) a high level of subjectivity and effort in evaluating the significant assumptions\nunderlying the position at year-end\u037e and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with\nspecialised skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among\nothers, (i) testing management\u2019s process for calculating the RIPS defined benefit obligations and (ii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to mortality assumptions, discount rates,\ninflation rates, future salary increases and future pension increases. Professionals with specialised skill and\nknowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of these assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \nLondon, United Kingdom \nJune 7, 2022, except for the change in composition of reportable segments discussed in Note A1 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, as to which the date is August 19, 2022.\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2021.\nF-4 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors, \nRentokil Initial plc\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Rentokil Initial plc (the Company) as of 31\nDecember 2020, the related consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income,\nconsolidated statements of changes in equity, and consolidated cash flow statements for each of the years in\nthe two-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial\nstatements).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of 31 December 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each\nof the years in the two-year period ended 31 December 2020, in conformity with the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nCorrection of misstatements\nAs discussed in notes A1, A3 and C2 to the consolidated financial statements, the 2020 and 2019\nconsolidated financial statements have been restated to correct misstatements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management.

The Group reassesses whether or not it\ncontrols a subsidiary if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of these three\nelements of control.\nThe Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date\nthat control commences until the date that control ceases. Inter-company transactions, balances, and gains\nand losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. When less than 100%\nof the issued share capital of a subsidiary is acquired, and the acquisition includes an option to purchase the\nremaining share capital of the subsidiary, the anticipated acquisition method is applied where judged\nappropriate to do so. The judgement is based on the risks and rewards associated with the option to\npurchase, meaning that no non-controlling interest is recognised. A liability is carried on the balance sheet\nequal to the fair value of the option to purchase. This is revised to the fair value at each reporting date with\ndifferences being recorded in equity.\nWhere the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any\nrelated non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in\nthe income statement. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is\nlost. Changes in the Group\u2019s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for\nas equity transactions.\nLosses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling\ninterests, which may cause the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.

The\nF-12 (i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(i) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nConsolidated Financial Statements include the Group\u2019s share of the total comprehensive income and equity\nmovements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until the date\nthat significant influence ceases. When the Group\u2019s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity\naccounted investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued\nexcept to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on\nbehalf of an investee.\nGains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the\nGroup\u2019s interest in the associates.\nForeign currency translation\n(a) Functional and presentation currency\nItems included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group\u2019s entities are measured using the currency of\nthe primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated\nFinancial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency of Rentokil Initial plc.\n(b) Group companies\nThe results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the\npresentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\nassets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date\nof the balance sheet\u037e\nincome and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates\u037e and\nall resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities,\nand of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments or deemed to\nbe quasi-equity, are taken to other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange\ndifferences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and\nliabilities of the foreign entity and translated at period-end exchange rates.\n(c) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing\nat the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such\ntransactions, or from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at\nreporting period end exchange rates, are recognised under the appropriate heading in the income statement\u037e\nexcept when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges or where certain intra-group loans are\ndetermined to be quasi-equity (normally not expected to be repaid).\n(d) Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies\nWith effect from 3 August 2021 the Group purchased Boecker Public Health SAL, a company which has\noperations in Lebanon and uses the Lebanese pound as its functional currency. The Lebanese economy was\ndesignated as hyperinflationary from September 2020. As a result, application of IAS 29 Financial Reporting\nin Hyperinflationary Economies has been applied for the Lebanese subsidiary, from the date of acquisition.\nThe IAS 29 rules are applied as follows:\nadjustment of the income statement at the end of the reporting period using the change in general\nprice index\u037e\nF-13 \n(ii) \n(iii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nadjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and liabilities for the change in purchasing\npower caused by inflation form the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date\u037e and\nadjustment of the income statement to reflect the impact of inflation and exchange rate movement\non holding monetary assets and liabilities in local currency.\nThe Consumer Price Index for Lebanon has been used for the relevant hyperinflationary adjustments. The\nindex on the date of acquisition was 514.89 and at 31 December 2021 was 921.40.\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual\nprovisions of the relevant instrument, and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.\nNote C5 of these notes discusses accounting for financial instruments.\nFinancial assets\nThe Group classifies its financial assets depending on the purpose for which the financial assets were\nacquired. At initial recognition the Group carries out a solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) test\nand a business model test to establish the classification and measurement of its financial assets. Financial\nassets are classified in the following categories:\n(a) Amortised cost\nFinancial assets under this classification are non-derivative financial assets held to collect the contractual\ncash flows until maturity and the cash flows are SPPI. Assets measured at amortised cost include trade and\nother receivables, cash and cash equivalents (excluding money market funds which are classified as FVTPL)\nand other investments.\n(b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)\nThese are non-derivative financial assets which can be for sale with cash flows that are SPPI. These assets\nare measured at fair value and changes to market values are recognised in other comprehensive income. The\nGroup has no assets classified under this category.\n(c) Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)\nFinancial assets under this classification are assets that cannot be classified in any of the other categories.\nThese assets are measured at fair value and changes to market values are recognised in profit and loss.\nFinancial liabilities\nAll financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method except for\nderivatives, which are classified as held for trading (except where they qualify for hedge accounting) and are\nheld at fair value.\nFinancial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, provisions, deferred consideration and\nborrowings.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements \nAssumptions and estimation uncertainties\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Estimates and assumptions are\ncontinually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of\nfuture events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from\nthese estimates and revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.\nF-14 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nSensitivities to the estimates and assumptions are provided, where relevant, in the relevant notes to the\nFinancial Statements.

Operating\nA1. Revenue recognition and operating segments\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue represents the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration to which the Group expects to be entitled. All revenue is considered revenue from contracts\nwith customers as defined by IFRS 15, including job work and sales of goods. Under IFRS 15, revenue is\nrecognised when a customer obtains control of goods or services in line with identifiable performance\nobligations. In the majority of cases the Group considers that the contracts it enters into are contracts for\nbundled services which are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, the majority of\nrevenue across the Group is recognised on an output basis evenly over the course of the contract because\nthe customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group\u2019s performance as it\nperforms. Job work is short-term contract revenue whereby the period of service is typically less than one\nmonth in duration. The performance obligations linked to this revenue type are individual to each job due to\ntheir nature, with revenue being recognised at a point in time on completion. Where consumables are\nsupplied separately from the service contract, revenue is recognised at the point the goods transfer.\nThe transaction price reported for all contracts is the price agreed in the contract and there are no material\nelements of variable consideration, financing component or non-cash consideration. The Group applies the\npractical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining\nperformance obligations because the Group has a right to consideration from customers in an amount that\ncorresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance obligations completed to date.\nDisaggregation of revenue into business segment, region and major type of revenue stream is shown below\nunder segmental reporting.\nPerformance obligations \nRevenue recognised over time\u202f-\u202fcontract service revenue\nThese are mainly full-service contracts, inclusive of equipment, maintenance and consumables as required.\nThe inclusive service is treated as a single performance obligation.\nPest Control: the Group offers a range of services with by far the most common being general pest\nmaintenance contracts. Under this type of contract the Group promises to provide a pest control\nservice for the duration of the contract. In order to fulfil this promise, equipment is supplied (such as\nbait boxes) and a technician maintains and monitors the equipment at a set number of visits per year,\nplus any additional call-outs as required\u037e so there is a stand-ready element to the service as well as an\nongoing service. The Group considers that this type of contract is a bundled service as the goods\nand services are not distinct in the context of the contract\u037e equipment is not supplied without the\nservice.\nHygiene & Wellbeing: the Group offers a similar type of service to Pest Control, providing washroom\nequipment, consumables and a technician to service the washroom. This type of contract will include\na set number of visits. Dispensers are replenished by the technician. Management considers that the\nsupply of goods and services are not distinct in the context of the contract. Dispensers and other\nequipment would not be supplied without providing the full service\u037e the equipment is controlled by\nthe Group and ownership does not transfer to the customer. In Ambius (interior landscaping) the\nmajor types of contract are for supply and maintenance of interior plants. Maintenance is only offered\nfor plants that were supplied by the Group and therefore the services are not distinct in the context of\nthe contract. The assets are positioned and situated by our technicians and the customer is not\npermitted to relocate them. At the end of the contract any assets on the customer\u2019s site are recovered.\nF-16 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nFrance Workwear: the main type of contract is for supply and laundering of garments for commercial\norganisations. Supply and laundry are not offered separately, therefore management considers the\nservices not to be distinct in the context of the contract. The service is treated as a bundle and a\nsingle performance obligation. Any equipment remains under ownership and control of the Group.\nRevenue recognised at a point in time\u202f-\u202fjob work\nThese services are short term in nature and only an immaterial amount would straddle an accounting period\nend. There is usually only one performance obligation with revenue recognised at the point of completion of\nthe work.\nPest Control: an example of this type of revenue in the Pest Control segment is bird-proofing which is\na one-off installation that, depending on the size of the site, may take between a few days and several\nweeks to complete. There is a single performance obligation (to install bird-proofing) and the\ncustomer is billed, and revenue recognised, at the end of the job. Our Property Care business\nincludes work such as woodworm treatment and damp-proofing. There is usually a single performance\nobligation with revenue recognised at a point in time. The value of this work is immaterial.\nHygiene & Wellbeing: this type of revenue is also generated by our Specialist Hygiene team and in our\nAmbius business. Our Specialist Hygiene team performs specialist cleaning services such as graffiti\nremoval, deep cleaning of kitchens and washrooms, trauma cleaning, flood or fire damage cleaning,\nand during the pandemic has been providing specialist deep cleaning and disinfection services.\nThese are usually short-term jobs (under one week) and usually there is a single performance\nobligation with revenue recognised on completion of the job. Our Ambius business includes work\nsuch as Christmas installations (trees and decorations). There is usually a single performance\nobligation with revenue recognised at a point in time. The value of this work is immaterial.\nRevenue recognised at a point in time\u202f-\u202fsale of goods\nSale of products and consumables relates mainly to the pest distribution businesses which sell pest control\nproducts to retailers and the pest control industry. In the Hygiene & Wellbeing segment there are some sales\nof consumables to customers. In all cases, revenue is recognised at the point in time that ownership\ntransfers to the customer.\nThe Group does not consider that any judgements were made that would have a significant impact on the\namount or timing of revenue recognised. The contracts in the business where revenue is recognised over\ntime are repetitive and are based on short cycles that repeat many times per year. Therefore, if revenue had\nbeen considered to be recognised at a point in time rather than over time, the in-year impact would be\nimmaterial.\nThe Group makes a charge against revenue for credit notes not yet issued at the balance sheet date. Due to\nprolonged government lockdowns in the year ended 31 December 2020 where customer sites could not be\naccessed, the charge for credit notes related to the UK (which makes up a significant part of the Group credit\nnote charge) increased significantly. This charge was estimated using data on incomplete service visits and\ncredit notes already issued in the year. The range of estimation uncertainty affecting the reported UK &\nIreland revenue of \u00a3287.5m was estimated to be between \u00a3(0.6)m and \u00a34.7m. As the pandemic subsided\nduring 2021 and lockdowns in the UK were lifted, the estimate of the level of credit notes required became\nmore certain which affected the amount of revenue recognised in 2021.\nContract costs\nContract costs are mainly incremental costs of obtaining contracts (primarily sales commissions directly\nrelated to contracts obtained), and to a lesser extent costs to fulfil contracts which are not within the scope\nof other standards (mainly incremental costs of putting resources in place to fulfil contracts).\nIt is anticipated that these costs are recoverable over the life of the contract to which they relate.\nAccordingly, the Group capitalises them as contract costs and amortises them over the expected life of the\nF-17 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\ncontracts. Management takes a portfolio approach to recognising contract costs, and the expected length of\ncontracts across the Group and associated amortisation periods are between three and six years.\nThe contract costs recognised in the balance sheet at the period end amounted to \u00a375.0m (2020: \u00a367.8m). The\namount of amortisation recognised in the period was \u00a330.4m (2020: \u00a328.1m, 2019: \u00a325.9m) and impairment\nlosses were \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a3nil, 2019: \u00a3nil).\nApplying the practical expedient in paragraph 94 of IFRS 15, the Group recognises the incremental costs of\nobtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortisation period of the assets that the Group\notherwise would have recognised is one year or less.\nContract assets\nContract assets relate to the Group\u2019s right to consideration for performance obligations satisfied but where\nthe customer has yet to be invoiced. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights\nbecome unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group issues an invoice to the customer. All opening\nbalances have been invoiced in the year.\nContract liabilities\nContract liabilities relate to advance consideration received from customers where the performance\nobligations have yet to be satisfied. All opening balances have subsequently been satisfied in the year. In\nmost business segments where revenue is recognised over time customers are invoiced in advance or\nsimultaneously with performance obligations being satisfied.\nSegment reporting\nSegmental information has been presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Reporting\nsegments reflect the internal management reporting structures. Each segment is headed by a Regional\nManaging Director who reports directly to the Chief Executive and is a member of the Group\u2019s Executive\nLeadership Team responsible for the review of Group performance. The operating businesses within each\nsegment report to the Regional Managing Directors.\nAt 1 January 2022 Rentokil Initial made changes to the regional operating segments, designed to provide\nclearer geographic links and to align growth strategies, as follows:\nNorth America: Puerto Rico joined the Latin America region\nEurope: Includes Nordics (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Poland), previously in UK & Rest\nof World region\nUK & Sub-Saharan Africa: No change to UK, Ireland & Baltics. Sub-Saharan Africa remained in this\nregion. Other Rest of World countries (MENAT and Caribbean) moved to other regions\nAsia & MENAT: Enlarged region includes Asia and MENAT countries\nLatin America: Includes Caribbean (formerly in UK & Rest of World) and Puerto Rico (formerly in\nNorth America)\nPacific: No change\nRentokil Initial historically had operated three business segments: Pest Control, Hygiene and Protect &\nEnhance. However, in response to the rising importance of hygiene and wellbeing services, at 1 January 2022\nRentokil Initial reorganised its business segments, primarily expanding the former Hygiene segment to\nbecome Hygiene & Wellbeing and reclassifying the businesses in its former Protect & Enhance segment,\neffective as at 1 January 2022. The Protect & Enhance segment had included five businesses: Ambius,\nProperty Care, Dental Services, Cleanroom Services and Workwear (France). The Ambius, Dental Services\nand Cleanroom Services businesses have been added to the enlarged segment, now called Hygiene &\nWellbeing, the Property Care business has been added to the Pest Control segment and Workwear (France)\nhas been left as a stand-alone segment.\nF-18 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \n(5) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nThe segment financial information presented reflects these reclassifications to conform the presentation in\nthe relevant periods to the revised operating segment structure. The Company\u2019s consolidated results were\nnot impacted by the changes discussed above.\nDisaggregated revenue under IFRS 15 is the same as the segmental analysis below. Restructuring costs and\ncentral and regional costs are presented at a Group level as they are not targeted or managed at segment\nlevel.

441.5\n384.0\n365.4\n15.0\n5.1\nA2. Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the\nCompany by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the\nRentokil Initial Employee Share Trust (see note at the bottom of the Consolidated Statement of Changes in\nEquity) which are treated as cancelled, and including share options for which all conditions have been met.\nFor diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to\ninclude all potential dilutive ordinary shares. The Group\u2019s potentially dilutive ordinary shares relate to the\ncontingent issuable shares under the Group\u2019s long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) to the extent that the\nperformance conditions have been met at the end of the period. These share options are issued for nil\nconsideration to colleagues if performance conditions are met.\nAdjusted earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted profit from continuing operations attributable\nto equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.\nAdjusted profit measures are used to give management and other users of the accounts a clear\nunderstanding of the underlying profitability of the business over time. Adjusted profit measures are\ncalculated by adding the following items back to the equivalent GAAP profit measure:\namortisation and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software)\u037e\none-off items (operating and associates)\u037e and\nnet interest adjustments.\nIntangible assets (excluding computer software) are recognised on acquisition of businesses which, by their\nnature, can vary by size and amount each year. As a result, amortisation of intangibles is added back to\nassist with understanding the underlying trading performance of the business and to allow comparability\nacross regions and business segments.\nOne-off items are significant expenses or income that will have a distortive impact on the underlying\nprofitability of the Group. Typical examples are costs related to the acquisition of businesses (including\naborted acquisitions), gain or loss on disposal or closure of a business, material gains or losses on disposal\nof fixed assets, adjustments to legacy property-related provisions (environmental liabilities), and payments\nor receipts as a result of legal disputes. An analysis of one-off operating items is set out in Note A1.\nOther non-cash gains and losses that can cause material fluctuations and distort understanding of the\nperformance of the business are net interest on pension schemes, interest fair value adjustments and the\nexcess IFRS 16 interest above the operating profit benefit reported in the year. These adjustments are made\nto aid year-on-year comparability.\nThe Group has no instruments that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, which were\nnot included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\nDetails of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below:\nF-24 \n)\n)\n)\n)\n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\n2021 \n\u00a3m\n2020 \n\u00a3m\n2019 \n\u00a3m\nProfit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the \nCompany\n263.2\n185.9\n283.5\nOne-off items\u202f-\u202foperating\n20.7\n7.7\n14.6\nOne-off items\u202f-\u202fassociates\n-\n-\n2.4\nNet gain on disposals\n-\n-\n(103.8\nAmortisation and impairment of intangibles\n74.3\n82.5\n85.2\nNet interest adjustments\n(3.6\n35.2\n4.0\nTax on above items\n(18.9\n(26.4\n(19.1\nAdjusted profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the \nCompany\n335.7\n284.9\n266.8\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (million)\n1,858.1\n1,853.2\n1,849.0\nAdjustment for potentially dilutive shares (million)\n8.2\n9.7\n11.5\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for diluted earnings per share\n(million)\n1,866.3\n1,862.9\n1,860.5\nBasic earnings per share\n14.16p\n10.03p\n15.33p\nDiluted earnings per share\n14.10p\n9.98p\n15.24p\nBasic adjusted earnings per share\n18.07p\n15.37p\n14.43p\nDiluted adjusted earnings per share\n17.99p\n15.29p\n14.34p\nExcluding computer software.\nIncludes: net interest credit from pensions \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a30.5m, 2019: \u00a30.7m, finance costs from hedge\naccounting recognised in other comprehensive income \u00a33.7m (2020: 4.3m, 2019: \u00a3nil), IFRS16 interest\nadjustment \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a3(2.1)m, 2019: \u00a3(3.2)m), interest fair value adjustment \u00a3(0.1)m (2020: \u00a3(37.9)m,\n2019: \u00a3(1.5)m)\nOne-off items\u202f-\u202foperating \u00a31.7m (2020: \u00a32.4m, 2019: \u00a3(1.1)m), amortisation and impairment of intangibles\n\u00a318.2m (2020: \u00a317.5m, 2019: \u00a319.6m), net interest adjustments \u00a3(1.0)m (2020: \u00a36.5m, 2019: \u00a30.6m).\nA3. Trade and other receivables\nThe Group\u2019s trade receivables are recognised at the transaction price less provision for impairment. They are\ngenerally due for settlement within 30 days and are therefore all classified as current. The amount of the\nprovision for impairment is recognised in the income statement and movements on provisions for impaired\ntrade receivables are recognised within operating expenses in the income statement. Amounts are generally\ncharged to the provision for impairment of trade receivables when there is no expectation of recovering\nadditional cash.\nExpected credit loss (ECL) calculations are performed quarterly and are used to calculate the provision. ECL\ncalculations are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses and are performed at country level. The\nGroup applies the simplified method of applying lifetime ECLs to trade receivables using an allowance matrix\nto measure the ECLs of trade receivables from its customers, which comprise customer portfolios across\nseveral countries. Credit risk factors that are considered as part of ECL calculations may include, but are not\nlimited to: payment history, customer size, customer type (national/residential/commercial/\u200bgovernment), age\nof debt, industry strength, economy, environmental factors such as climate change and product or service\nprovided.\nThere is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the Group\u2019s customer\nbase being large and diverse. The amount of credit risk with respect to customers is represented\nF-25 \n)\n(1)\n(2)\n)\n(3)\n)\n)\n)\n(1) \n(2) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nby the carrying amount on the balance sheet. The Group policy is that credit facilities for new customers are\napproved by designated managers at regional level. Credit limits are set with reference to trading history and\nreports from credit rating agencies where they are available. Where this is not feasible the Group may request\npayment in advance of work being carried out, or settlement by credit card on completion of the work. There\nare no trade receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic the risk of impairment of trade receivables increased significantly in the year\nended 31 December 2020. ECL calculations reflected management\u2019s estimate of the increased risk that some\ncustomers will be unable to settle their debts. As the pandemic subsided the situation became clearer and\nthese estimates were reassessed in the year ended 31 December 2021.\n2021 \n\u00a3m\nAs\nrestated \n2020  \n\u00a3m\nTrade receivables\n473.6\n546.8\nLess: provision for impairment of trade receivables\n(49.2\n(61.4\nTrade receivables\u202f-\u202fnet\n424.4\n485.4\nOther receivables\n62.5\n48.8\nPrepayments\n35.4\n29.3\nContract assets\n18.9\n19.2\nTotal\n541.2\n582.7\nAnalysed as follows:\nNon-current\n14.3\n13.1\nCurrent\n526.9\n569.6\nTotal\n541.2\n582.7\nContract assets represents revenue that has been recognised for performance obligations satisfied but\nwhere the customer has yet to be invoiced.

In most business\nsegments our customers are invoiced in advance or simultaneously with performance obligations being\nsatisfied.\nPut options are held following the acquisition of PCI in 2017 where the seller may require the Group to\npurchase the remaining shares of the business in stages over a fixed term between 2023 and 2027. The put\noptions are accounted for as an anticipated acquisition of the remaining shares and no non-controlling\ninterest is recognised. The Group recognised a put option liability for the anticipated acquisition of these\nshares in contingent consideration, and any movements in the carrying value are recognised through equity.\nThe assumptions that are made in estimating the value of this put option liability are option price and\ndiscount rate. A 5% reduction in the estimated option price would result in a \u00a32.1m decrease in the liability,\nand a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in a \u00a31.3m increase in the liability. All gains and losses\nrelating to the put options are recognised through equity.\nGiven the volume of acquisitions and the variety of inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration\n(depending on each transaction) there is not considered to be any change in input that would have a material\nimpact on the contingent consideration liability.\nOther than the put options, there are no liabilities in the table above that bear interest and therefore the cash\nflows are equal to the carrying value of the liabilities. Cash is due to flow between one and five years for all\nnon-current liabilities and not beyond. Fair value is equal to carrying value for all trade and other payables.\nThere is no material difference between the fair value and carrying value for all trade and other payables.\nThe currency split of trade and other payables is as follows:\n2021 \n\u00a3m\n2020 \n\u00a3m\nPound sterling\n164.8\n154.4\nEuro\n198.1\n205.6\nUS dollar\n262.9\n442.0\nOther currencies\n209.7\n193.4\nCarrying value\n835.5\n995.4\nF-28 \n(1)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nA6. Provisions for liabilities and charges\nThe Group has environmental, self-insurance and other provisions. Provisions are recognised when the\nGroup has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be\nrequired to settle the obligation, and the amount is capable of being reliably estimated. If such an obligation\nis not capable of being reliably estimated it is classified as a contingent liability (Note D3).\nFuture cash flows relating to these obligations are discounted when the effect is material. In the years\nending 31 December 2021 and 2020 the US was the only country where the effect of discounting was material.\nThe discount rates used are based on government bond rates in the country of the cash flows, and were\n0.9% (2020: 0.9%) for the US.\nJudgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for environmental restoration. These\nprovisions tend to be long term in nature and the use of an appropriate market discount rate and forecast\nfuture utilisation based upon management\u2019s best estimate determines the level of provision required at the\nbalance sheet date. The phasing and actual cash spend may be different from the forecast on which the\nprovision is based.\nEnvironmental\n\u00a3m\nSelf-\nInsurance\n\u00a3m\nOther\n\u00a3m\nTotal \n\u00a3m\nAt 1 January 2020\n14.2\n29.3\n15.6\n59.1\nExchange differences\n0.7\n(0.9\n0.3\n0.1\nAdditional provisions\n0.4\n14.7\n13.0\n28.1\nUsed during the year\n(1.8\n(10.7\n(6.7\n(19.2\nUnused amounts reversed\n-\n(0.2\n(4.1\n(4.3\nAcquisition of companies and businesses\n0.1\n-\n-\n0.1\nUnwinding of discount on provisions\n-\n0.3\n-\n0.3\nAt 31 December 2020\n13.6\n32.5\n18.1\n64.2\nAt 1 January 2021\n13.6\n32.5\n18.1\n64.2\nExchange differences\n(0.7\n0.3\n(0.6\n(1.0\nAdditional provisions\n-\n17.8\n6.5\n24.3\nUsed during the year\n(2.4\n(14.3\n(9.6\n(26.3\nUnused amounts reversed\n-\n(0.8\n(1.8\n(2.6\nAcquisition of companies and businesses\n-\n1.7\n0.3\n2.0\nUnwinding of discount on provisions\n-\n0.3\n-\n0.3\nAt 31 December 2021\n10.5\n37.5\n12.9\n60.9\n2021 \nTotal \n\u00a3m\n2020\nTotal\n\u00a3m\nAnalysed as follows:\nNon-current\n33.9\n34.1\nCurrent\n27.0\n30.1\nTotal\n60.9\n64.2\nEnvironmental\nThe Group owns a number of properties in Europe and the US where there is land contamination.

Self-insured deductibles within these insurance policies have changed over\ntime due to external market conditions and scale of operations. These provisions represent obligations for\nopen claims and are estimated based on actuarial/management\u2019s assessment at the balance sheet date. The\nGroup expects to continue self-insuring the same level of risks and estimates that 50% to 75% of claims\nshould settle within the next five years.\nOther\nOther provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising and costs relating to\ndisposed businesses and restructuring costs. Other provisions also include costs relating to properties the\nGroup no longer occupies such as security, utilities and insurance.

Employee benefit expense\nProfit-sharing and bonus plans\nThe Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on calculations of\nachievements of financial performance targets and based on the best estimate of the obligation to colleagues\nrelated to personal performance criteria being achieved. A liability is recognised where a contractual\nobligation exists or where past practice indicates that there is a constructive obligation to make such\npayments in the future.\nHoliday pay\nPaid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the\nbenefits are earned. An accrual is made at the balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays earned\nbut not yet taken.\nTermination benefits\nTermination benefits are payable when an employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or\nwhenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises\ntermination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment of current\ncolleagues according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal\u037e or providing termination\nbenefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12\nmonths after the balance sheet date are discounted to present value where the effect of discounting is\nmaterial.\n2021 \n\u00a3m\n2020 \n\u00a3m\n2019 \n\u00a3m\nWages and salaries\n1,224.8\n1141.2\n1,147.2\nSocial security costs\n137.5\n128.8\n129.4\nShare-based payments\n9.8\n5.5\n5.3\nPension costs:\n\u202f-\u202fdefined contribution plans\n31.4\n27.0\n33.7\n\u202f-\u202fdefined benefit plans\n1.4\n2.4\n1.5\n1,404.9\n1,304.9\n1,317.1\nWages and salaries are disclosed net of any local government wage-related grants as disclosed in Note\nD5.\nMonthly average number of people employed by the Group during the year:\n2021 \nNumber\n2020 \nNumber\n2019 \nNumber\nProcessing and service delivery\n34,163\n33,174\n31,863\nSales and marketing\n5,400\n5,272\n5,169\nAdministration and overheads\n6,468\n6,142\n5,901\n46,031\n44,588\n42,933\nF-31 \n(1)\n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nEmoluments of the Directors of Rentokil Initial plc are detailed below.\nHighest \npaid \nDirector \n2021 \n\u00a3000\nOther \nDirectors\n2021 \n\u00a3000\nHighest\npaid \nDirector\n2020 \n\u00a3000\nOther \nDirectors\n2020 \n\u00a3000\nHighest\npaid \nDirector\n2019 \n\u00a3000\nOther \nDirectors\n2019 \n\u00a3000\nAggregate emoluments excluding share\noptions\n2,661.2\n1,444.0\n867.3\n575.6\n2,045.4\n1,178.2\nAggregate gains made by Directors on\nexercise \nof share options\n916.3\n370.6\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAggregate amount receivable under\nlong-term \nincentive schemes\n3,340.0\n145.9\n3,187.9\n1,325.6\n2,512.3\n1,615.1\nAggregate value of Company\ncontributions to \ndefined contribution pension schemes\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n6,917.5\n1,960.5\n4,055.2\n1,901.2\n4,557.7\n2,793.3\n2021 \nNumber\n2020 \nNumber\n2019 \nNumber\nNumber of Directors accruing retirement benefits\n\u202f-\u202fdefined contribution schemes\n\u2007\u20072\n\u2007\u20073\n\u2007\u20072\n\u202f-\u202fdefined benefit schemes\n-\n-\n-\nNumber of Directors exercising share options\n2\n2\n-\nNumber of Directors receiving shares as part of long-term incentive schemes\n2\n3\n2\nThe highest paid Director exercised 163,625 (2020: nil, 2019: nil) share options during the year.\nA10. Retirement benefit obligations\nApart from contributions to legally required social security state schemes, the Group operates a number of\npension schemes around the world covering many of its colleagues.\nThe principal pension scheme in the Group is the UK Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme (RIPS) which has\na defined contribution section, and a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new\nentrants and future accrual of benefits. On 4 December 2018, the Group signed an agreement with Pension\nInsurance Corporation plc (PIC) to take over the payment of the liabilities in the scheme via a buy-in, which\nconverted to a full buy-out on 24 February 2022.\nA number of much smaller defined benefit and defined contribution schemes operate elsewhere which are\nalso funded through payments to trustee-administered funds or insurance companies.\nDefined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial\nassumptions. Judgement is required in determining these actuarial assumptions.\nDefined benefit pension plans\nA defined benefit pension plan is a plan that estimates the amount of future pension benefit that an\nemployee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as years of service,\ncompensation and age.\nThe asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair\nvalue of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The\nGroup determines the net interest on the net defined benefit asset for the period by applying the discount\nrate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined\nF-32 \n(1)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nbenefit asset. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the\nprojected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by\ndiscounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that\nhave a credit rating of at least AA, are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and\nthat have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The Group will\nrecognise a pension surplus as an asset where there is an unconditional right to a refund or where the Group\nhas a right to reduce future pension contributions, taking into account the adverse effect of any minimum\nfunding requirements.\nCurrent and past service costs, to the extent they have vested, and curtailments are recognised as charges or\ncredits against operating profit in the income statement. Interest income on the net defined benefit asset is\nrecognised in finance income. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, return\non plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement\nof Comprehensive Income.\nDefined contribution pension plans\nA defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate\nentity.\nThe Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a mandatory,\ncontractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have\nbeen paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid\ncontributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future\npayments is available.\nRIPS\nThe assets of the RIPS are legally separated from the Group. The Trustee of the RIPS is Rentokil Initial\nPension Trustee Limited. The board comprises five company-nominated directors and three member-\nnominated directors. The Trustee is required by law to act in the best interests of the members and\nbeneficiaries of the RIPS and is responsible for setting certain policies (e.g., investment, contribution and\nindexation policies) of the scheme.\nOn 4 December 2018 the Trustee entered into a binding agreement with PIC to insure the liabilities of the\nRIPS, known as a buy-in. In December 2021 the final true-up premium was paid to PIC and on 24 February\n2022 the insurance policy with PIC was transferred to the individual members of the scheme. Accordingly, in\n2022 both the Scheme\u2019s assets and liabilities have been reduced by the policy value (\u00a31,238.6m).\nThere remains some uncertainty regarding the final surplus that will be available to the Group until\nGuaranteed Minimum Pension adjustments for members who transferred out of the scheme have been settled\nand final scheme expenses have been paid. However, in December 2020 the Trustee made a partial refund of\nsurplus to the Group of \u00a313.0m. The remaining surplus is recognised as a retirement benefit asset at\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of the value that will be returned to the Group when the wind-up of the Scheme\ncompletes.\nThe defined benefit schemes of the RIPS are reappraised semi-annually by independent actuaries based\nupon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19R requirements (including schemes which are insured\nunder a buy-in contract). The assumptions used for the RIPS are shown below:\n31\nDecember \n2021\n31\nDecember \n2020\nWeighted average %\nDiscount rate\n2.0\n1.4\nFuture salary increases\nn/a\nn/a\nFuture pension increases\n3.3\n3.0\nRPI inflation\n3.4\n3.0\nCPI inflation\n2.7\n2.3\nF-33 \n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nThe defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current colleagues, former colleagues and current\npensioners. Approximately 40% (2020: 35%) of the liabilities are attributable to current and former colleagues\nand 60% (2020: 65%) to current pensioners. There have been no significant changes to the membership of\nthe scheme over the year. The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit\npayments are made. For the RIPS as a whole, the duration is around 17 years.\nThe assets in the scheme consist of cash held in liquidity funds, and the fair value of the insurance policy.\nThe fair value of the insurance policy asset is deemed to be equal to the present value of the related\nobligations that it covers at the balance sheet date.\nRisks\nAs noted above, the Trustee purchased an insurance policy that covers all retirement benefit obligations\nwithin the Scheme, thereby removing exposure to the significant risks within the Scheme (including changes\nin bond yields, inflation and longevity). The Scheme\u2019s insurer (PIC) is now responsible for ensuring that\nthere are sufficient assets to meet all future pension obligations, and is subject to EU solvency regulations.\nThere is no volatility associated with the insurance policy asset as under IAS 19 its value is deemed to\nmatch the Scheme liabilities. Asset volatility is limited only to the assets remaining in the Scheme following\nthis transaction which are expected to be returned to the Company on wind-up of the Scheme. The surplus\nrecognised of \u00a318.2m is management\u2019s estimate of the asset that will return to the Company on wind-up\n(subject to tax at 35%).\nMortality assumptions\nThe mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of Scheme members, and allow\nfor expected future improvements in mortality rates.

Share-based payments\nShare-based compensation\nThe Group operates one equity-settled share-based long-term incentive plan (LTIP). The economic cost of\nawarding shares and share options to colleagues is recognised as an expense in the income statement,\nequivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded. The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing\nmodels, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-Scholes models. The charge is recognised in the income\nstatement over the vesting period of the award. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of\nthe number of shares that vest or options that are expected to become exercisable. Any revision to the\noriginal estimates is reflected in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately\nto the extent it relates to past service, and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.\nPerformance Share Plan\nThe Company introduced a share-based performance plan in 2006 for senior managers worldwide. The main\nfeatures of the scheme are as follows:\nFor awards made in 2018, one-third of the award is based on earnings per share (EPS) growth targets\nand two-thirds of the award is based on total shareholder return (TSR) over the three-year\nperformance period as explained above.\nFor awards made in 2019, 50% of the award is based on TSR and 25% is based on EPS growth targets\nas explained above. The remaining 25% is based on performance against certain strategic and\nfinancial measures over the vesting period.\nFor awards made in 2020, 60% of the award is based on TSR and 40% is based on performance against\ncertain strategic and financial measures over the vesting period.\nFor awards made in 2021, 50% of the award is based on TSR and 50% is based on performance against\ncertain strategic and financial measures over the vesting period.\nF-36 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nThe value of dividends paid during the vesting period is paid on the number of shares that ultimately\nvest in the form of additional shares.\nFor awards that are nil-cost options, this is the value of dividends between grant and exercise.\nThe total net charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was \u00a39.8m (2020:\n\u00a35.5m).\nA summary of the number of shares in active share option plans is shown below:\nShare options outstanding (not exercisable)\nShare options exercisable\nYear \nof \ngrant\nVesting\nyear\nScheme \ninterest\nat \n1 January\n2021\nShares \nawarded \nduring \n2021\nShares \nlapsed \nduring \n2021\nShares \nvested \nduring \n2021\nShares \noutstanding\n(not \nexercisable)\nat \n31\nDecember \n2021\nShares \nexercisable\nat \n1 January \n2021\nShares \nvested \nduring \n2021\nShares \nexercised \nduring \n2021\nShares\nlapsed \nduring\n2021\nShares \noutstanding \n(exercisable)\nat \n31 December\n2021\n2012\n2015\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n179,519\n-\n(10,968\n-\n168,551\n2013\n2016\n-\n12,073\n-\n(12,073\n-\n1,085,178\n12,073\n(71,944\n-\n1,025,307\n2014\n2017\n-\n13,693\n-\n(13,693\n-\n1,200,990\n13,693\n(26,613\n-\n1,188,070\n2015\n2018\n-\n15,831\n-\n(15,831\n-\n1,398,235\n15,831\n(49,797\n-\n1,364,269\n2016\n2019\n-\n22,920\n(15\n(22,905\n-\n2,052,013\n22,905\n(131,521 (1,323\n1,942,074\n2017\n2020\n-\n19,720\n(85\n(19,635\n-\n1,784,890\n19,635\n(171,187 (7,720\n1,625,618\n2018\n2021 6,024,191\n164,397 (1,066,488 (4,230,356\n891,744\n- 4,230,356 (2,691,765\n-\n1,538,591\n2019\n2022 4,993,019\n33,885\n(250,755\n-\n4,776,149\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2020\n2023 3,561,710\n754\n(91,452\n-\n3,471,012\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2021\n2024\n- 4,228,162\n(90,489\n-\n4,137,673\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nShare options outstanding (not exercisable)\nShare options exercisable\nYear \nof \ngrant\nVesting\nyear\nScheme \ninterest\nat \n1 January\n2020\nShares \nawarded \nduring \n2020\nShares \nlapsed \nduring \n2020\nShares \nvested \nduring \n2020\nShares \noutstanding\n(not \nexercisable)\nat \n31\nDecember \n2020\nShares \nexercisable\nat \n1 January \n2020\nShares \nvested \nduring \n2020\nShares \nexercised \nduring \n2020\nShares \nlapsed \nduring \n2020\nShares \noutstanding \n(exercisable)\nat \n31 December\n2020\n2012\n2015\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n214,132\n-\n(34,613\n-\n179,519\n2013\n2016\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,266,153\n-\n(180,975\n-\n1,085,178\n2014\n2017\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,382,204\n-\n(181,214\n-\n1,200,990\n2015\n2018\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2,178,655\n-\n(777,521\n(2,899\n1,398,235\n2016\n2019\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3,117,476\n- (1,047,232 (18,231\n2,052,013\n2017\n2020 4,717,888\n157,880 (528,405 (4,347,363\n-\n- 4,347,363 (2,562,473\n-\n1,784,890\n2018\n2021 6,601,097\n6,545 (324,013\n(259,438\n6,024,191\n-\n259,438\n(259,438\n-\n-\n2019\n2022 5,326,306\n- (333,287\n-\n4,993,019\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2020\n2023\n- 3,561,710\n-\n-\n3,561,710\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOf the 22.1m options outstanding at 31 December 2021, 8.85m are only subject to administrative exercise for\nno proceeds and have been considered as outstanding shares in basic earnings per share (7.7m at 31\nDecember 2020).\nThe fair value of the awards made under the 2006 Performance Share Plan is charged to the income statement\nover the vesting period based on values derived from a Monte Carlo model prepared by external\nremuneration consultants.

The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily\nshare prices. As the awards are nil-cost (i.e., there is no exercise price), the assumed risk-free rate of return\nhas minimal impact on the fair value of the awards. Similarly, as dividend equivalents are paid on the vesting\nportion of awards, the fair value of these awards is not reduced to reflect dividends paid during the vesting\nperiod.\nThe fair value of awards granted during 2021 was \u00a316.0m (2020: \u00a314.1m) and the weighted average fair value\nper award granted during the year was 371.7p. The weighted average share price for options exercised in the\nyear was 505.6p and the weighted average contract term remaining on shares unexercised at the year end was\n450 days.\nA12. Income tax expense\nThe income tax expense for the period comprises both current and deferred tax. Current tax expense\nrepresents the amount payable on this year\u2019s taxable profits and any adjustment relating to prior years.\nTaxable profits differ from accounting profits as some items of income or expenditure are not taxable or\ndeductible or may be taxable or deductible in a different accounting period. The current income tax charge is\ncalculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the\ncountries where the Group\u2019s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.\nDeferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to\ndifferences between accounting and tax bases. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to\napply when the timing difference reverses based on tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted at\nthe balance sheet date. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items\nrecognised in other comprehensive income or equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other\ncomprehensive income or equity as appropriate.\nAnalysis of charge in the year:\n2021 \n\u00a3m\n2020 \n\u00a3m\n2019\n\u00a3m\nUK corporation tax at 19.0% (2020: 19.0%, 2019: 19.0%)\n9.5\n8.8\n8.3\nOverseas taxation\n47.8\n60.9\n41.6\nAdjustment in respect of previous periods\n(3.3\n(3.1\n8.8\nTotal current tax\n54.0\n66.6\n58.7\nDeferred tax expense/(credit)\n20.8\n(17.0\n0.7\nDeferred tax adjustment in respect of previous periods\n(12.9\n(6.1\n(4.7\nTotal deferred tax\n7.9\n(23.1\n(4.0\nTotal income tax expense\n61.9\n43.5\n54.7\nThe tax on the Group\u2019s profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the\nweighted average tax rate applicable to profits of the consolidated companies as follows:\nF-38 \n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\n2021 \n\u00a3m\n2020 \n\u00a3m\n2019 \n\u00a3m\nProfit before income tax\n325.1\n229.8\n338.5\nTax calculated at domestic tax rates applicable to profits in the respective \ncountries\n76.5\n55.7\n82.6\nAdjustment in respect of previous periods\n(16.2\n(9.2\n4.1\nExpenses not deductible for tax purposes\u202f-\u202fone-off items\n3.0\n0.2\n8.0\nExpenses not deductible for tax purposes\u202f-\u202fother\n3.2\n1.9\n4.4\nIncome not subject to tax\n(1.0\n(1.3\n(0.7\nImpairment of goodwill\n-\n3.2\n1.0\nGoodwill deductions and revaluation of intangible assets\n(2.4\n(0.9\n(1.3\nUtilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses\n(0.6\n(0.7\n(5.7\nDeferred tax recognised on losses\n(2.8\n(2.1\n(7.7\nLosses not relieved\n0.3\n0.3\n1.0\nDeferred tax impact of change in tax rates\n(3.6\n(8.9\n0.2\nProvisions utilised for which no deferred tax assets were recognised\n(1.5\n(1.4\n(2.2\nOverseas withholding tax suffered\n0.7\n0.7\n0.5\nDeferred tax on unremitted earnings\n0.3\n-\n0.8\nTax on overseas dividends\n-\n-\n1.0\nLocal business taxes\n1.0\n1.8\n1.6\nForeign exchange differences\n0.5\n0.7\n(3.5\nDisposal gain not subject to tax\n-\n-\n(31.6\nUS BEAT liability\n4.8\n3.1\n2.2\nOther\n(0.3\n0.4\n-\nTotal tax expense\n61.9\n43.5\n54.7\nThe Group\u2019s Effective Tax Rate (ETR) for 2021 on reported profit before income tax is 19.0% (2020: 18.9%,\n2019: 16.2%). The Group\u2019s ETR before amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software), one-\noff items and the net interest adjustments for 2021 was 19.4% (2020: 19.7%, 2019: 21.6%). This compares with\na blended rate of tax for the countries in which the Group operates of 24% (2020: 24%, 2019: 23%). The\nGroup\u2019s low tax rate is primarily attributable to net prior-year tax credits of \u00a316.2m. Of this, \u00a37.2m is due to a\nreduction in the Group\u2019s uncertain tax provisions arising as a result of issues being settled for less than the\nprovision held or becoming statute barred during the year ended 31 December 2021. The Group\u2019s ETR is low\nfor the year ended 31 December 2020 compared with the prior year mainly due to the impact of deferred tax\nrate changes in the UK and France.\nThe Group\u2019s tax charge and ETR will be influenced by the global mix and level of profits, changes in future\ntax rates and other tax legislation, foreign exchange rates, the utilisation of brought-forward tax losses on\nwhich no deferred tax asset has been recognised, the resolution of open issues with various tax authorities,\nacquisitions and disposals.\nA tax credit of \u00a32.2m has been recognised in other comprehensive income which relates to the tax effect of\nmark to market movements on cross-currency and interest rate swaps recorded within other comprehensive\nincome.\nA13. Current tax liabilities\nTax liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless there is a right to defer the payment of the liability for\nat least one year after the balance sheet date. As at 31 December 2021 and 2020 all the Group\u2019s tax liabilities\nhave been classified as current as there is no legally enforceable right to defer payment for more than 12\nmonths.\nF-39 \n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the asset\nand liability.\nWhere required by accounting standards, management establishes provisions for uncertain tax positions on\nthe basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. The Group\u2019s current tax liabilities reflect\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of the future amounts of corporation tax that will be settled.\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. There are various uncertainties relating to\nthe determination of its tax liabilities where the ultimate tax liability cannot be known until a resolution has\nbeen reached with the relevant tax authority, or the issue becomes time barred. Issues can take many years to\nresolve and therefore assumptions on the likely outcome have to be made by management. Each country and\ntax risk is considered separately when deciding whether it is appropriate to set up an uncertain tax provision.\nIf risks are considered to be linked, the Group will consider the tax treatment in aggregate where appropriate.\nThis assessment of uncertain tax positions is based on management\u2019s interpretation of relevant tax rules and\ndecided cases, external advice obtained, the statute of limitations and the status of the negotiations and past\nexperience with tax authorities. In evaluating whether a provision is needed it is assumed that tax authorities\nhave full knowledge of the facts and circumstances applicable to each issue.\nTax provisions can be built up over a number of years but in the year of resolution there could be\nadjustments to these provisions which could have a material positive or negative impact on the tax charge\nfor a particular year. The settlement of a significant issue could also have a material impact on the amount of\ncash tax payable in any one year. Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income\ntaxes particularly in relation to the pricing of intra-group goods and services as well as debt financing.\nThe majority of the tax provisions relate to transfer pricing exposures where the Group faces a number of\nrisks in jurisdictions around the world, and is subject to audits by tax authorities in the territories in which it\noperates. These tax audits have an uncertain outcome and can take several years to resolve, which in some\ncases may be dependent on litigation. The actual outcome could vary from management\u2019s estimates, but\nthese are updated at each reporting period in the light of the latest available information.\nTotal uncertain tax provisions (including interest thereon) amounted to \u00a357.2m as at 31 December 2021 (2020:\n\u00a364.6m). Included within this amount is \u00a311.5m (2020: \u00a311.5m) in respect of interest arising on tax provisions\nwhich is included within other payables. These tax provisions relate to multiple issues across the countries\nin which the Group operates. The net decrease in the provisions for the year is mainly attributable to issues\nwhich have been settled in the year or have become statute barred.\nApart from transfer pricing exposures the largest single provision relates to a financing structure where the\namount provided is \u00a311.0m (2020: \u00a310.9m) including interest. This is a legacy issue going back to the years\n2002 to 2004. The Group is fully provided for the potential tax and interest payable so there is not expected to\nbe an adverse impact on the income statement. It is unclear when this issue will be resolved and therefore\nthe timing of any payment is uncertain.\nThe cash tax paid for the year was \u00a368.9m (2020: \u00a364.4m, 2019: \u00a343.2m), the increase being in line with the\nincreased profits. The cash tax paid is expected to increase in future periods as open issues are resolved\nalthough it is not possible to estimate the exact timing of tax cash flows.\nA14. Deferred income tax\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following temporary\ndifferences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill\u037e the initial recognition of assets or\nliabilities in transactions other than a business combination that at the time of the transactions affect neither\nthe accounting nor taxable profit or loss\u037e and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent\nthat they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred income tax is determined\nusing tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted (or substantively enacted) at the balance sheet date, and\nF-40 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nare expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax\nliability is settled. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when the timing differences relate to income\ntaxes levied by the same tax authority on an entity or different entities which are part of a tax consolidation\nand there would be the intention to settle on a net basis.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be\navailable against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The amount of deferred tax assets\nrecognised at each balance sheet date is adjusted to reflect changes in management\u2019s assessment of future\ntaxable profits. In recognising the deferred tax asset in respect of losses, management has estimated the\nquantum of future taxable profits applying a risk weighting to future profits to reflect the uncertainties.\nThe movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows:\n2021 \n\u00a3m\n2020 \n\u00a3m\nAt 1 January\n(57.0\n(81.5\nExchange differences\n1.7\n(0.6\nAcquisition of companies and businesses\n(7.7\n(5.1\nCredited to the income statement\n(7.9\n23.1\nCredited to other comprehensive income\n(0.2\n3.9\nCharged to equity\n4.6\n3.2\nAt 31 December\n(66.5\n(57.0\nDeferred taxation has been presented on the balance sheet as follows:\nDeferred tax asset within non-current assets\n41.6\n37.7\nDeferred tax liability within non-current liabilities\n(108.1\n(94.7\n(66.5\n(57.0\nThe major components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the year end and their changes during the year\n(without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction) are as follows:\nCustomer \nlists/ \nintangibles\n\u00a3m\nAccelerated \ntax \ndepreciation\n\u00a3m\nRetirement\nbenefits \n\u00a3m\nUnremitted \nearnings \nfrom \nsubsidiaries\n\u00a3m\nTax \nlosses\n\u00a3m\nShare-\nbased \npayments\n\u00a3m\nOther\n\u00a3m\nTotal \n\u00a3m\nAt 1 January 2020\n72.6\n42.0\n4.5\n4.2\n(23.0\n(8.3\n(10.5\n81.5\nExchange differences\n(1.8\n1.4\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1.0\n0.6\nRecognised in income statement\n0.3\n0.4\n(4.1\n0.1\n5.5\n2.1\n(27.4\n(23.1\nRecognised in other comprehensive \nincome\n-\n-\n(3.9\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(3.9\nRecognised in equity\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(3.2\n-\n(3.2\nAcquired in business combinations\n5.1\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n5.1\nAt 31 December 2020\n76.2\n43.8\n(3.5\n4.3\n(17.5\n(9.4\n(36.9\n57.0\nAt 1 January 2021\n76.2\n43.8\n(3.5\n4.3\n(17.5\n(9.4\n(36.9\n57.0\nExchange differences\n-\n(1.4\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(0.3\n(1.7\nRecognised in income statement\n0.8\n7.4\n1.4\n0.4\n3.6\n(0.8\n(4.9\n7.9\nF-41 \n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n(1)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nCustomer \nlists/ \nintangibles\n\u00a3m\nAccelerated \ntax \ndepreciation\n\u00a3m\nRetirement\nbenefits \n\u00a3m\nUnremitted \nearnings \nfrom \nsubsidiaries\n\u00a3m\nTax \nlosses\n\u00a3m\nShare-\nbased \npayments\n\u00a3m\nOther\n\u00a3m\nTotal \n\u00a3m\nRecognised in other comprehensive \nincome\n-\n-\n0.2\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.2\nRecognised in equity\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(4.6\n-\n(4.6\nAcquired in business combinations\n6.6\n0.1\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1.0\n7.7\nAt 31 December 2021\n83.6\n49.9\n(1.9\n4.7\n(13.9\n(14.8\n(41.1\n66.5\nIncluded within other deferred tax assets/liabilities are bad debt provisions, other provisions and IFRS\n15 contract costs.\nThe UK corporate tax rate will increase from 19% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023. This has resulted in an\nincrease in the UK deferred tax asset recognized at 31 December 2021 of \u00a33.1m.\nA deferred tax asset of \u00a313.9m (2020: \u00a317.5m) has been recognised in respect of losses, of which \u00a312.4m\n(2020: \u00a316.0m) relates to UK losses carried forward at 31 December 2021. This amount has been calculated by\nestimating the future UK taxable profits, against which the UK tax losses will be utilised, and applying the tax\nrates (substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date) applicable for each year. Remaining UK tax losses\nof \u00a340.6m (2020: \u00a347.5m) have not been recognised as at 31 December 2021 as it is not considered probable\nthat future taxable profits will be available against which the tax losses can be offset. The estimates of future\nprofits are based on management\u2019s financial forecasts which are used to support other aspects of the\nfinancial statements such as impairment testing. At the balance sheet date the Group had tax losses of\n\u00a381.6m (2020: \u00a3105.0m) on which no deferred tax asset is recognised because it is not considered probable\nthat future taxable profits will be available in certain jurisdictions to be able to benefit from those tax losses.\nOf the losses, \u00a38.3m (2020: \u00a314.6m) will expire at various dates between 2022 and 2032.\nIn addition, the Group has UK capital losses carried forward of \u00a3276.3m (2020: \u00a3276.3m) on which no deferred\ntax asset is recognised. These losses have no expiry date but management considers the future utilisation of\nthese losses to be unlikely.\nDividends received from subsidiaries are largely exempt from UK taxation but may be subject to dividend\nwithholding or other taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate. A\ndeferred tax liability of \u00a34.7m (2020: \u00a34.3m) has been recognised in respect of this liability as it is anticipated\nthat these profits will be distributed to the UK in the foreseeable future. At the balance sheet date there is no\nmaterial unprovided deferred tax liability were overseas earnings to be distributed to the UK.\nB. Investing\nB1. Business combinations\nAll business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method (acquisition accounting) in\naccordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the\nfair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments\nissued by the acquirer. The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by\nrecognising the acquiree\u2019s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition\ncriteria at their fair values. The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control\nof the acquiree.\nAn intangible asset is recognised if it meets the definition under IAS 38 Intangible Assets. The intangible\nassets arising on acquisition are goodwill, customer lists and brands. Goodwill represents the synergies,\nworkforce and other benefits expected as a result of combining the respective businesses. Customer lists and\nbrands are recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition using an income-based approach,\nF-42 \n(1)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nwhich involves the use of assumptions including customer termination rates, profit margins, contributory\nasset charges and discount rates. The use of these assumptions requires estimation in the valuation\napproach\u037e however, it is not considered that these estimates carry a significant risk of material adjustment.\nAt the date of acquisition, deferred and contingent consideration represents its fair value, with subsequent\nchanges after the measurement period being recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\nCosts directly attributable to business combinations are charged to the income statement as incurred and\npresented as one-off items.\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2021 the Group purchased 100% of the share capital or trade and assets\nof 52 companies and businesses. It also acquired the remaining shares from a non-controlling interest which\nis recognised as an equity transaction rather than a business combination. The total consideration in respect\nof these acquisitions was \u00a3313.7m and the cash outflow from current and past period acquisitions net of\ncash acquired, was \u00a3463.1m.\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2020 the Group purchased 100% of the share capital or trade and assets\nof 23 companies and businesses. The total consideration in respect of these acquisitions was \u00a3367.3m and\nthe cash outflow from current and past period acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was \u00a3194.7m.\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2019 the Group purchased 100% of the share capital or trade and assets\nof 41 companies and businesses. The total consideration in respect of these acquisitions was \u00a3328.6m and\nthe cash outflow from current and past period acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was \u00a3315.7m.\nDisclosures required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations are provided separately for those individual\nacquisitions that are considered to be material, and in aggregate for individually immaterial acquisitions. An\nacquisition would generally be considered individually material if the impact on the Group\u2019s adjusted\nrevenue and profit measures (on an annualised basis) is greater than 5%, or the impact on goodwill is greater\nthan 10% of the closing balance for the period. There were no individually material acquisitions in the years\nended 31 December 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nDetails of goodwill and the fair value of net assets acquired are as follows:\n2021 \n\u00a3m\n2020 \n\u00a3m\n2019 \n\u00a3m\nPurchase consideration\n\u202f-\u202fCash paid\n273.1\n156.9\n290.3\n\u202f-\u202fDeferred and contingent consideration\n40.6\n210.4\n38.3\nTotal purchase consideration\n313.7\n367.3\n328.6\nFair value of net assets acquired\n(83.1\n(49.9\n(62.8\nGoodwill from current-year acquisitions\n230.6\n317.4\n265.8\nOf the above goodwill amounts \u00a3146.4m (2020: \u00a3303.5m, 2019: \u00a3258.4m) is expected to qualify for tax relief.\nDeferred consideration of \u00a312.6m (2020: \u00a3192.3m, 2019: \u00a323.4m) and contingent consideration of \u00a328.0m\n(2020: \u00a318.1m, 2019: \u00a314.9m) are payable in respect of the above acquisitions.

Amounts for both\ndeferred and contingent consideration are payable over the next five years. The Group has recognised\ncontingent and deferred consideration based on fair value at the acquisition date. A range of outcomes for\ncontingent consideration payments cannot be estimated due to the variety of performance conditions and\nthe volume of businesses the Group acquires. During the year ended 31 December 2021 there were releases\nof contingent consideration liabilities not paid of \u00a30.6m (2020: \u00a31.6m, 2019: \u00a31.1m).\nF-43 \n)\n)\n)\n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \n(5) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nThe provisional fair values\n of assets and liabilities arising from acquisitions in the year are as follows:\n2021 \n\u00a3m\n2020 \n\u00a3m\n2019 \n\u00a3m\nNon-current assets\n\u202f-\u202fIntangible assets\n70.7\n56.9\n70.5\n\u202f-\u202fProperty, plant and equipment\n13.2\n9.9\n17.0\n\u202f-\u202fOther non-current assets\n1.7\n-\n-\nCurrent assets\n36.8\n20.4\n14.3\nCurrent liabilities\n(25.4\n(20.0\n(20.8\nNon-current liabilities\n(13.9\n(17.3\n(18.2\nNet assets acquired\n83.1\n49.9\n62.8\nThe provisional fair values are finalised in the year following acquisition.

These assets are\nreviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of\nthe asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The fair value attributable to intangible assets acquired\nthrough a business combination is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to be\ngenerated from that asset at the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital for the Group. The residual\nvalues of intangible assets are assumed to be \u00a3nil.\nThe estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows:\nCustomer lists:\n3 to 15 years\nOther intangibles:\n2 to 15 years\nProduct development:\n2 to 5 years\nComputer software:\n3 to 5 years\nThe following are the main categories of intangible assets with finite useful lives:\n(a) Customer lists\nCustomer lists are acquired as part of business combinations.

No value is attributed to internally generated brands as expenditure incurred to develop,\nmaintain and renew brands internally is recognised as an expense in the period incurred. Intellectual property\ncosts are incurred in acquiring and maintaining patents and licences. These are recognised only if the cost\ncan be measured reliably, and they are expected to generate economic benefits beyond one year, in excess of\ntheir cost.\n(c) Product development\nCosts incurred in the design and testing of new or improved products are recognised as intangible assets\nonly if the cost can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the project will be a success considering its\ncommercial and technological feasibility.

For the\npurpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to\ncountry of operation and reportable business unit. The way in which CGUs are identified has not changed\nfrom prior periods. Newly acquired entities might be a single CGU until such time that they can be integrated.\nGains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity\nsold.\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash\nflow projections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate. The cash flow projections in year one are\nbased on financial budgets approved by management, which are prepared as part of the Group\u2019s normal\nplanning process. Cash flows for years two to five use management\u2019s expectation of sales growth, operating\ncosts and margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and\nF-47 \n(1)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nprofitability for each CGU. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-\nterm growth rates (LTGR).\nCash flow projections included in the impairment review models include management\u2019s view of the impact of\nclimate change, including costs related to the effects of climate change, as well as the future costs of the\nGroup\u2019s commitment to reach net zero by 2040 and costs of compliance with current legal requirements. The\npotential increased costs, less any benefits that may occur, to meet these commitments are not expected to\nbe material and therefore have resulted in no impairments during 2021 or 2020.\nFor the Rentokil PCI CGU in India the assumptions made in estimating the value of the future cash flows are\nan LTGR of 4.0% (2020: 5.0%), a pre-tax discount rate of 12.6% (2020: 13.9%) and a terminal operating margin\nof 15.1%.

Financing\nC1. Financial risk management\nThe Group\u2019s central treasury function manages cash, borrows on behalf of the Group and provides finance\nto Group companies in their local currencies. Treasury activity is governed by a Treasury Committee which is\nchaired by the Chief Financial Officer.\nThe main financial risks faced by the Group are set out below.\n(a) Liquidity risk\nThe Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its business needs, and appropriate\nreserves to cover operational underperformance or dislocation in the financial markets. It is the Group\u2019s\npolicy to have headroom of unrestricted cash and available committed facilities of at least \u00a3600m (2020:\n\u00a3150m\u202f-\u202f\u00a3600m), and the Treasury Committee manages financing requirements and associated headroom at\nleast 12 months forward.\nIn July 2021 the Group repaid the remaining \u20ac175.7m outstanding under the \u20ac350m bond due in October 2021\nusing cash from the November 2020 \u20ac600m bond issuance under its three months at par call option. Available\ncommitments of \u00a3550m under the revolving credit facility (RCF) together with unrestricted cash of \u00a3235.3m\ngave the Group combined headroom of \u00a3785.3m at 31 December 2021.\nIn March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group drew down the full \u00a3550m available under\nits RCF. After establishing a \u00a31bn Commercial Paper Programme, the Group drew down \u00a3600m on the Bank of\nEngland\u2019s Covid Commercial Financing Facility (CCFF) in April 2020. Both the RCF and the CCFF were repaid\nin full in June and July respectively. The Group repaid its two fixed interest perpetual debentures for \u00a31.3m\nand \u00a30.3m in May 2020. These were originally issued in 1898 and 1904 respectively. The $50m term loan was\nrepaid on maturity on 19 June 2020. In August 2020 the second of the two one-year extension options on the\nRCF was exercised and granted resulting in a new maturity date of 22 August 2025. In October 2020 the\nGroup issued an eight-year \u20ac600m bond with a coupon of 0.50% under its Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN)\nProgramme. Part of the bond proceeds were used to repay c.50% of the \u20ac350m bond that matured in October\n2021 following a successful tender offer in November 2020. Available commitments of \u00a3550m under the RCF\ntogether with unrestricted cash of \u00a3716.3m gave the Group combined headroom of \u00a31,266.3m at 31 December\n2020.\nThe Group has a \u00a3550m RCF with 17 relationship banks (see Note C7 for details). In September 2021, the\nGroup negotiated the permanent removal of financial covenants from the RCF with all bank approval. In\naddition to this the Group also amended the RCF to comply with the move from LIBOR to risk free rates. The\nGroup has no other facility that references LIBOR. Previously the facilities contained covenants that\nrequired EBITDA:net interest to be at least 4.0:1.0 and that net debt:adjusted EBITDA should be no greater\nthan 3.5:1.0. Compliance with financial and other covenants were reviewed regularly and financial covenants\nwere reported to the lenders semi-annually in line with the requirements under the facility. The Group is\ncompliant with the terms and conditions of its debt facilities.\nThe Group targets an S&P Global (S&P) investment grade credit rating for debt issuance of BBB over the\nmedium term. In line with S&P liquidity ratio requirements, debt maturities are financed at least 12 months in\nadvance using available cash or committed facilities, or by issuance of new debt. Management maintains an\nactive dialogue with S&P, as well as the Group\u2019s relationship banks, to ensure that any changes to the\nGroup\u2019s financing and acquisition strategies are understood. S&P affirmed the Group\u2019s rating as BBB if the\nacquisition of Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. goes ahead as announced.\nAll of the Group\u2019s bonds issued under its EMTN Programme contain a coupon step-up which increases the\ncoupon payable by 1.25% in the event that the Group is downgraded to BB+ or below (sub-investment\ngrade). The Group\u2019s bonds may be called by their investors at par in the event of a change of control of the\nGroup. They may also be called within 120 days if the Group\u2019s debt is downgraded below investment\nF-54 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\ngrade, or if the rating is withdrawn and the rating agency confirms in writing, either publicly or to the Group\nor the Trustee, that the rating action occurred either wholly or in part due to a change of control.\n(b) Credit risk\nThe Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. Sales are typically low-value, high-volume,\nspreading the risk across a large number of customers and geographies. Policies are in place to ensure that\ncredit sales are only made to customers with an appropriate credit history. The Group operates in some\nterritories where there is increased exposure to trade credit risks and in those territories the Group puts in\nplace appropriate measures to manage its credit risk exposure.\nIn order to protect the liquid assets and funding relationships of the Group, management aims to maintain\nbanking relationships with counterparties that carry a long-term credit rating of at least A-, or equivalent\nrating with one of the major credit rating agencies. In countries where no banks are rated A- or above,\nbalances are monitored monthly and kept to a minimum. In addition, funds held with all counterparties are\nsubject to limits. All exposures are monitored and reported to the Treasury Committee each month. The\nGroup also monitors the creditworthiness of its lenders to ensure that commitments under its facilities are\navailable as needed.\nAt 31 December 2021 the Group had a total of \u00a310.7m of cash held on bank accounts with banks rated below\nA- by S&P (2020: \u00a310.0m). The highest concentration with any single bank rated below A- was \u00a31.7m (2020:\n\u00a31.8m).\n(c) Market risk\nForeign exchange risk\nThe Group\u2019s worldwide operations generate profits and cash flows in foreign currencies. Sales and\npurchases are typically denominated in the currency of the country in which they are transacted, and the\nGroup\u2019s cross-border procurement is considered insignificant. Sterling procurement and central costs mean\nthat foreign currencies constitute more than 100% of Group adjusted operating profit at approximately 104%\n(2020: 117%).\nThe Group\u2019s primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is in relation to the translation of assets and\nliabilities, and the Group aims to hold debt in currencies in proportion to its forecast foreign currency profits\nand investments. Foreign exchange derivatives are used to manage foreign currency exposures in excess of\n\u00a30.5m (\u00a35.0m for USD) that are not covered by debt or assets in the same (or another highly correlated)\ncurrency, as long as it makes sense from an economic perspective to do so. The Treasury Committee\nmonitors foreign exchange exposures on a monthly basis. Dealing in foreign exchange products is controlled\nby dealing mandates approved by the Treasury Committee and all foreign exchange transactions are covered\nby ISDA documentation.\nThe most significant foreign currency groups are US dollars and euros, which make up 41.5% (2020: 46.7%)\nand 34.8% (2020: 41.0%) of Group adjusted operating profit respectively.\nAt 31 December 2021 the Group\u2019s net debt was approximately 57% US dollar (2020: 48%), reflecting that it is\nthe Group\u2019s principal cash flow exposure\u037e and 45% euro (2020: 52%), with 2% net cash offset in other\ncurrencies. The translation of the interest element of euro and US dollar debt provides a partial income\nstatement offset to the translation of earnings.\nThe Group calculates the impact on the income statement and other comprehensive income of a 10%\nmovement in foreign exchange rates. The Group\u2019s principal foreign currency exposure is the US dollar. For\nUS dollars, a 10% movement in \u00a3/$ would result in a \u00a319.4m increase/decrease (2020: \u00a317.8m) in adjusted\noperating profit, offset by a \u00a31.6m decrease/increase (2020: \u00a31.2m) in interest payable. A 10% movement in \u00a3/\u200b\n\u20ac would result in a \u00a315.6m increase/decrease (2020: \u00a315.6m) in adjusted operating profit, offset by a \u00a31.0m\ndecrease/increase (2020: \u00a31.5m) in interest payable.\nF-55 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nWhere possible, currency cash flows are used to settle liabilities in the same currency in preference to selling\ncurrency in the market.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group seeks to manage interest rate risk to ensure reasonable certainty of its interest charge while\nallowing an element of risk exposure consistent with the variability of its cash flows. Interest rate risk is\nmanaged by the use of fixed interest debt and interest rate derivatives, which are approved in advance by the\nTreasury Committee. The Group policy is to fix a minimum of 50% of its estimated future interest rate\nexposures (excluding pensions) for a minimum period of 12 months forward. The Treasury Committee reviews\nthis exposure monthly. During the year ended 31 December 2021 the Group signed IBOR Fallback Protocols\nwith the two banks that have provided interest rate hedges that reference LIBOR. The Group has no other\nLIBOR-based exposures.\nA hypothetical 1.0% increase in euro interest rates would reduce the market value of the Group\u2019s bond\nliabilities by \u00a361.9m at 31 December 2021 (2020: \u00a379.8m). The income statement impact is \u00a3nil as changes in\ninterest rates do not change the expected cash flows on the bonds.\nThe Group had outstanding bond debt issues at 31 December 2021 with a fair market value of \u00a31,272.1m\n(2020: \u00a31,537.3m). This exceeds the book value of \u00a31,253.7m (2020: \u00a31,487.8m) as a result of reductions in\ninterest rates in Europe. There are no circumstances where the Group would be obliged to pay the fair market\nvalue. The Group could however decide to redeem some or all of its bonds early and the fair market value is\nindicative of the price that would be required to do so.\nIn 2019, to manage its US dollar interest cost, the Group entered into a low volatility Synthetic Borrowing\nUnit (SBU) instrument for $335m that yielded 1.90%. The SBU instrument effectively hedged the \u00a3/$\nmovement but at a lower cost of debt. Due to a reduction in US base rate a decision was made to trade out of\nthe SBU in August 2020. The interest benefit generated by the SBU for 2020 was \u00a33.1m.\n(d) Capital risk\nThe Group is committed to maintaining a debt/equity structure that allows continued access to a broad range\nof financing sources and sufficient flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities as they present themselves,\nwithout onerous financing terms and conditions. The Group\u2019s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so\nas to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to support the Group\u2019s strategy. The Group uses\nS&P\u2019s ratings methodology for a BBB issuer to manage its capital risk. In the event that a ratings downgrade\nis likely net debt can be managed by reducing or suspending dividends, M&A spend and capital\nexpenditure. The Group would also consider raising additional equity to protect its BBB rating.\n(e) Treasury risk\nThe Group\u2019s treasury activities are governed by a treasury policy, which is reviewed and approved by the\nBoard on an annual basis. The treasury policy covers all activities associated with managing the above risks.\nThe policy requires that financial instruments are only utilised to manage known financial exposures and\nspeculative derivative contracts are not entered into. The treasury policy requires that the Group Treasury\nfunction must approve opening and closing of all bank accounts, and that funds transfers and other\npayments are only made in accordance with bank mandates.\nTo ensure an appropriate control environment exists in the treasury function, duties are segregated between\nfront and back office teams. In addition a number of controls are in place to protect against potential cyber\nsecurity and other risks.\nLIBOR reform\nIn September 2021 the Group updated its RCF to incorporate the switch from LIBOR to risk free rates. The\nGroup has also signed ISDA fallback agreements with its interest rate swap counterparties, which means that\nthe Group has no exposure to GBP or USD LIBOR going forward.\nF-56 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nC2.

This\ninvestment is classified as FVTPL.\nIn October 2020 the Group issued a \u20ac600m bond which was in part to be used to repay the \u20ac350m bond that\nmatured in October 2021. Following a successful tender offer \u20ac175m of the bond was repaid early. Part of the\nproceeds (\u00a3172.2m) were swapped into sterling and deposited. On maturity in July 2021 the funds were\nconverted back to euros and used to repay the remaining \u20ac175m outstanding under the \u20ac350m bond using\nthe three months at par call option.\nNone of the financial assets are either past due or impaired in 2021 (2020: none).\nC5. Derivative financial instruments\nAccounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are\nsubsequently remeasured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. The method of recognising the\nresulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so,\nthe nature of the item being hedged. At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the\nrelationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and\nstrategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at\nhedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions\nare effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items.\nCertain financial instruments are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting. Typically the Group\nwill not designate financial instruments for hedge accounting where a perfect or near perfect offset is\nexpected between the change in value of assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of any derivative\ninstruments in this category are immediately recognised in the income statement. Where financial\ninstruments are designated for hedge accounting they are designated as either fair value hedge, net\ninvestment hedge or cash flow hedge. When designating cross-currency swaps, the cost of hedging has\nbeen excluded from the relationship and any movement in the fair value related to the cost of hedging is\ndeferred in equity and amortised over the life of the hedged item.\nF-61 \n(1)\n(1)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\n(a) Fair value hedge\nThese instruments are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised\nin the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are\nattributable to the hedged risk. There were no fair value hedges as at the year end date.\n(b) Net investment hedge\nThese instruments are used to hedge exposure on translation of net investments in foreign operations. Any\ngain or loss on the hedging instrument related to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other\ncomprehensive income\u037e the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the\nincome statement. In the event of disposal of a foreign operation, the gains and losses accumulated in other\ncomprehensive income are recycled through the income statement. All currencies are directly hedged\ntherefore the hedge ratio is considered to be 1:1.\nThe Group expects that the values of the hedged item and hedging instrument will move in opposite\ndirections in response to movements in the same hedged risk. Where there are sufficient levels of\ndenominated net assets, the critical terms are deemed to match.\nThe following net investment hedges were in place at 31 December 2021:\nUS dollar net investment hedge relationship: $807.0m (2020: $601.5m) cross-currency swaps notional and\n$92.7m (2020: $80.4m) cross-currency swaps future interest cash flows have been used to hedge $899.7m\n(2020: $681.9m) of the net assets of the US operating subsidiaries. The movement in the cross-currency\nswaps due to changes in $/\u200b\u00a3 exchange rates are in the opposite direction of the changes due to $/\u200b\u00a3 in the\nsubsidiaries assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically change in the opposite\ndirection of each other. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an economic relationship.\nEuro net investment hedge relationship: \u20ac551.8m (2020: \u20ac567.9m) bonds are used to hedge the net assets of\nthe euro operating subsidiaries totalling \u20ac551.8m (2020: \u20ac567.9m). The movement in the bonds due to\nchanges in \u20ac/\u200b\u00a3 exchange rates are in the opposite direction of the changes due to \u20ac/\u200b\u00a3 in the subsidiaries\nassets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically change in the opposite direction of each\nother. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an economic relationship.\nAustralian dollar (AUD) net investment hedge relationship: AUD9.1m (2020: AUD9.6m) overdraft is used to\nhedge AUD9.1m of the net assets of the AUD denominated operating subsidiaries. The movement in the\noverdraft balance due to changes in AUD/GBP exchange rates are in the opposite direction of the changes\ndue to AUD/GBP in the subsidiaries assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically\nchange in the opposite direction of each other. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an\neconomic relationship.\nJapanese yen (JPY) net investment hedge relationship: JPY1.2bn (2020: JPY1.2bn) cross-currency swap is\nused to hedge JPY1.2bn of the net assets of the Japanese associate. The movement in the cross-currency\nswaps due to changes in JPY/GBP exchange rates are in the opposite direction of the changes due to\nJPY/GBP in the associate\u2019s assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically change in the\nopposite direction of each other. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an economic\nrelationship.\nDuring the year there was a gain of \u00a31.7m (2020: \u00a30.7m) relating to ineffectiveness of net investment in\nforeign entity hedges. The main source of ineffectiveness of the net investment hedge is the off-market value\nof the cross-currency swaps used to hedge US dollar net assets at the hedge designation date.\nIneffectiveness due to changes in the counterparty credit risk was not material in the year and is expected to\nremain so due to the Group\u2019s policy of only using counterparties with a credit rating of A- and above.\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, the amount in comprehensive income related to net investment hedge\naccounting was a gain of \u00a315.0m (2020: \u00a317.2m loss).\nF-62 \nUSD\nJPY\nEUR\nAUD\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\nThe effect of the foreign currency related hedging instruments on the Group\u2019s financial position and\nperformance is shown in the table below:\n2021\nHedging instruments\nCurrency\nCarrying\namount \nat year \nend date \n\u00a3m\nNotional\namount \n\u00a3m\nMaturity date\nHedge\nratio\nChange in \nfair value\nof \noutstanding\ninstrument \n\u00a3m\nChange\nin \nfair\nvalue of\nhedged\nitem \n\u00a3m\nIneffectiveness\n\u00a3m\nWeighted\naverage \nforeign \nexchange\nrate \nfor the \nyear\nCross-currency swaps\n1.6\n596.4\nNovember\n2024\u202f-\u202f \nOctober 2028\n1:1\n(15.6\n(17.5\n1.9\n1.296\nCross-currency swaps\n1.2\n7.6\nNovember 2022\n1:1\n0.7\n0.7\n-\n134.326\nBonds\n(462.7\n(463.7\nNovember\n2024\u202f-\u202f \nOctober 2028\n1:1\n27.9\n27.9\n-\n1.147\nOverdraft\n(4.9\n(4.9\nn/a\n1:1\n0.2\n0.2\n-\n1.857\n2020\nHedging instruments\nCurrency\nCarrying\namount \nat year \nend date \n\u00a3m\nNotional\namount \n\u00a3m\nMaturity date\nHedge\nratio\nChange in \nfair value\nof \noutstanding\ninstrument \n\u00a3m\nChange\nin \nfair\nvalue of\nhedged\nitem \n\u00a3m\nIneffectiveness\n\u00a3m\nWeighted\naverage \nforeign \nexchange\nrate for\nthe \nyear\nCross-currency swaps\nUSD\n13.3\n439.8\nNovember\n2024\u202f-\u202f \nMay 2026\n1:1\n8.2\n7.8\n0.4\n1.268\nCross-currency swaps\nJPY\n0.4\n8.4\nNovember 2022\n1:1\n0.4\n0.4\n-\n134.326\nBonds\nEUR\n(506.4\n(507.2\nNovember\n2024\u202f-\u202f \nMay 2026\n1:1\n(26.5\n(26.5\n-\n1.152\nOverdraft\nAUD\n(5.4\n(5.4\nn/a\n1:1\n(0.4\n(0.4\n-\n1.857\nOverdraft\nNZD\n(3.2\n(3.2\nn/a\n1:1\n(0.5\n(0.5\n-\n2.014\nFX swaps\nUSD\n1.2\n41.9\nJanuary 2021\n1:1\n5.4\n5.4\n-\n1.336\n(c) Cash flow hedge\nThese instruments are used to hedge a highly probable forecast transaction, or a change in the cash flows of\na recognised asset or liability. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the\neffective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is\nimmediately recognised in the income statement. The gains or losses that are recognised in comprehensive\nincome are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the\nincome statement. In the event that the hedged item occurs or is no longer expected to occur, accumulated\ngains or losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve are immediately recognised in the income statement. In\nthe event that the hedged item is expected to occur but no longer meets the requirements of hedge\naccounting, accumulated gains or losses remain in other comprehensive income and are only recognised in\nthe income statement when the forecast transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur. All cash flow\nhedge relationships are hedges of a foreign currency risk and all currencies were directly hedged therefore\nthe hedge ratio is considered to be 1:1.\nCash flow hedge accounting has been applied to derivatives (marked as \u2018cash flow hedge\u2019 in the table in\nNote C6) in accordance with IFRS 9. Where no hedge accounting has been applied, related derivatives have\nbeen marked as \u2018non-hedge\u2019.\nThe hedged item, a euro bond, creates an exposure to pay interest annually and the principal at maturity. By\nreceiving the same amount at the same dates through a cross-currency swap, this exposure is eliminated.\nSince the critical terms of the derivative and the hedged debt match (i.e., matching currencies,\nF-63 \n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nEUR\nLevel 2 - \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u202f(Continued)\npayment dates and interest rate on the leg of the swap offsetting the bond), the change in value of the\nderivative, excluding any basis risk, will be considered to completely offset the changes in the hedged cash\nflow.\nAny ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedge is taken directly to finance costs. During the year there was a\nloss of \u00a30.8m (2020: loss of \u00a30.7m) from those derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship. The main source\nof ineffectiveness in the cash flow hedge is the off-market value of the derivatives hedging the \u20ac400m bond\nmaturing in 2024 at the inception of the hedge relationship. Ineffectiveness due to changes in the\ncounterparty credit risk was not material in the year and is expected to remain the same because the Group\u2019s\ncounterparties credit rating is A- and above.\nCash flow hedge accounting has been applied to \u20ac340.0m (2020: \u20ac340.0m) of the \u20ac400m 2024 bond, \u20ac179.4m\n(2020: \u20ac179.4m) of the \u20ac500m 2026 bond and \u20ac175.0m (2020: nil) of the \u20ac600m 2028 bond. The cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps are used as hedging instruments to hedge the volatility in the \u00a3/\u200b\u20ac exchange rate of the\nbonds. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the amount in comprehensive income related to cash flow\nhedge accounting was a gain of \u00a313.2m (2020: \u00a34.9m loss).\nThe effect of the foreign currency related hedging instruments on the Group\u2019s financial position and\nperformance is shown in the table below:\n2021\nHedging\ninstruments\nCurrency\nCarrying\namount \nat year \nend date \n\u00a3m\nNotional\namount \n\u00a3m\nMaturity date\nHedge\nratio\nCumulative\nchange in \nfair value\nof \noutstanding\ninstrument \n\u00a3m\nCumulative\nchange in \nfair value\nof \nhedged \nitem \n\u00a3m\nIneffectiveness\n\u00a3m\nWeighted\naverage \nrate for\nthe \nyear\nCross-currency \nswaps\n(25.3\n694.5\nNovember\n2024\u202f-\u202f \nOctober\n2028\n1:1\n(23.8\n(22.7\n(1.1\n1.131\n2020\nHedging\ninstruments\nCurrency\nCarrying\namount \nat year \nend date \n\u00a3m\nNotional\namount \n\u00a3m\nMaturity date\nHedge\nratio\nCumulative\nchange in \nfair value\nof \noutstanding\ninstrument \n\u00a3m\nCumulative\nchange in \nfair value\nof \nhedged \nitem \n\u00a3m\nIneffectiveness\n\u00a3m\nWeighted\naverage \nrate for\nthe \nyear\nCross-currency \nswaps\nEUR\n(8.3\n519.5\nNovember\n2024\u202f-\u202f \nMay 2026\n1:1\n7.8\n(7.4\n(0.4\n1.115\nAmount in cash flow hedge reserves related to continuing hedges is a gain of \u00a38.8m (2020: \u00a34.4m loss), and\nthe amount related to discontinued hedges is \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a3nil).\nC6.

            "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nEXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) \n1. General information\nThe Company is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the UK with a\nlisting on the London Stock Exchange. The address of its registered office is Rentokil Initial plc, Compass\nHouse, Manor Royal, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 9PY.\nThe consolidated half-yearly financial information for the half-year to 30 June 2022 was approved on 27 July\n2022 for issue on 28 July 2022.\nThese interim financial results do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 435 of the\nCompanies Act 2006.\n2. Basis of preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB),\nwith the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and in accordance with IAS\n34 Interim Financial Reporting as contained in UK-adopted international accounting standards. The\ncondensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial\nstatements for the year ended 31 December 2021 which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as\nissued by the IASB and UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the\nCompanies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts that demonstrate that the Group has sufficient liquidity to\nmeet its obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these\nFinancial Statements.\nAdditionally the Directors have assessed severe but plausible downside scenarios, including the impact of\nfurther lockdowns. The most severe downside scenario assumes a revenue decline of 30% against base\nbudget for a period of eighteen months in the next 24 months, which is considerably worse than the Group\u2019s\nactual performance in 2020 which saw a downturn of <30% for one month only.\nIn addition the Directors have considered the incremental impacts of a failed Terminix transaction. This\nwould potentially include the payment of committed deal costs and a break fee.\nConsequently, the directors are confident that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its\nliabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and\ntherefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.\n3. Accounting policies\nThe preparation of the interim financial information for the half-year ended 30 June 2022 requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses,\nassets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the statement. If in the future such\nestimates and assumptions, which are based on management\u2019s best judgement at the date of the statement,\ndeviate from the actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate\nin the year in which the circumstances change.\nThere are no significant judgements or key sources of estimation uncertainty made by management in\napplying the Group\u2019s accounting policies.\nSignificant seasonal or cyclical variations in the Group\u2019s total revenues are not experienced during the\nfinancial year.\nChanges in accounting policies\nExcept as described below, the accounting policies applied in these interim financial statements are the same\nas those applied in the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended\nF-77 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\u202f(Continued)\n31 December 2021. The changes in accounting policies are also expected to be reflected in the Group\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements as at and for the year ending 31 December 2022.\nA number of new standards are effective from 1 January 2022 but they do not have a material effect on the\nGroup\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Group has adopted the following amendments to standards with effect from 1 January 2022:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use\u202f-\u202fAmendments to IAS 16\nOnerous Contracts\u202f-\u202fCost of Fulfilling a Contract\u202f-\u202fAmendments to IAS 37\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\nReference to the Conceptual Framework\u202f-\u202fAmendments to IFRS 3.\nThese standards have had no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group. Consequently,\nno adjustment has been made to the comparative financial information as at 31 December 2021 or 30 June\n2021. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not\nyet effective.\n4. Segmental information\nSegmental information has been presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Reporting\nsegments reflect the internal management organisation and reporting structures. Each segment is headed by\na Regional Managing Director who reports directly to the Chief Executive and is a member of the Group\u2019s\nExecutive Leadership Team responsible for the review of Group performance. The operating businesses\nwithin each segment report to the Regional Managing Directors.\nFrom 1 January 2022 there was a change to the regional operating and business segment reporting structure\nand financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2021 were retrospectively adjusted. This updated\nreporting structure is reflected in the tables below.\nDisaggregated revenue under IFRS 15 is the same as the segmental analysis below. Restructuring costs and\ncentral and regional overheads are also presented centrally as they are not targeted or managed at business\nsegment level. The basis of presentation is consistent with the information reviewed by internal\nmanagement.

The Group\u2019s Effective Tax Rate (ETR) before\namortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software), one-off items and the net interest\nadjustments for the period was 21.8% (H1 2021: 20.4%).

As a result deferred tax balances have been calculated at 19% or 25% depending upon when the\nbalance is expected to unwind.\nOn 20 July 2022, HM Treasury released draft Pillar 2 legislation that would commence from 1 January 2024.\nWe are reviewing this draft legislation to understand the potential impact on the Group.\nThe Group\u2019s ETR is expected to remain above the UK tax rate due to the proportion of overseas profits which\nare taxed at a higher rate than UK profits. In the medium term the Group\u2019s Adjusted ETR is likely to increase\ntowards the blended tax rate. The blended tax rate is expected to increase to 25% in 2023 when the UK tax\nrate increases to 25%.\nTotal uncertain tax positions (including interest thereon) amounted to \u00a356.7m as at 30 June 2022 (December\n2021: \u00a357.2m). Included within this amount is \u00a311.3m (December 2021: \u00a311.5m) in respect of interest arising\non tax provisions which is included in other payables.\nTotal tax payments for the period amounted to \u00a332.2m (2021: \u00a325.0m), an increase of \u00a37.2m.\nThe movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows:\n6 months\nto \n30 June\n2022 \n\u00a3m\n6 months to\n30 June\n2021 \n\u00a3m\nAt 1 January\n(66.5\n(57.0\nExchange differences\n(7.3\n2.1\nAcquisition of companies and businesses\n(15.6\n(3.5\nCredited to the income statement\n9.7\n3.4\nCharged to other comprehensive income\n(0.3\n(0.3\n(Charged)/credited to equity\n(4.3\n1.2\nAt 30 June\n(84.3\n(54.1\nDeferred taxation has been presented on the balance sheet as follows:\nDeferred tax asset within non-current assets\n43.7\n36.5\nDeferred tax liability within non-current liabilities\n(128.0\n(90.6\n(84.3\n(54.1\nA deferred tax asset of \u00a38.2m has been recognised in respect of UK losses (December 2021: \u00a312.4m) carried\nforward at 30 June 2022. This amount has been calculated by estimating the future UK taxable profits, against\nwhich the UK tax losses will be utilised, and applying the tax rates (substantively enacted as at the balance\nsheet date) applicable for each year. Remaining UK tax losses of \u00a334.6m have not been recognised as at 30\nJune 2022 as it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the tax\nlosses can be offset.\nAt the balance sheet date the Group had tax losses of \u00a367.0m (December 2021: \u00a381.6m) on which no deferred\ntax asset is recognised because it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available in\ncertain jurisdictions to be able to benefit from those tax losses.\n6.

Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group\u2019s share of the\nnet identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition. It is recognised as an intangible\nasset. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included in investments in associates.\nGoodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses and is tested annually for impairment. For the\npurpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to CGUs identified according to country of operation\nand reportable business unit. The way in which CGUs are identified has not changed from prior periods.\nNewly acquired entities might be a single CGU until such time that they can be integrated. Gains and losses\non the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash\nflow projections and fair value less costs to dispose if appropriate. The cash flow projections in year one are\nbased on financial budgets approved by management, which are prepared as part of the Group\u2019s normal\nplanning process. Cash flows for years two to five use management\u2019s expectation of sales growth, operating\ncosts and margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability\nfor each CGU. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth\nrates (LTGR). The effect of climate change has been considered in the cash flows.\nAn assessment has been performed for all material CGUs at the half year to identify any possible indicators\nof impairment. The assessment included a review of internal and external factors that have the potential to\nsignificantly reduce the CGU value. No indicators of possible impairment have been identified as a result of\nthis assessment.\n8.

Retirement benefit obligations\nApart from the legally required social security state schemes, the Group operates a number of pension\nschemes around the world covering many of its colleagues.\nBuy-out of the Group\u2019s principal scheme (the Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom\n(\u201cthe Scheme\u201d)) completed on 24 February 2022, extinguishing a retirement benefit obligation of \u00a31,152.1m\nand the related insurance policy asset. At 30 June 2022 a retirement benefit asset relating to the Scheme\nremains on the balance sheet amounting to \u00a318.2m (December 2021: \u00a318.2m). This represents the surplus\nassets remaining in the Scheme that will be distributed to the Group on wind up of the Scheme. It remains\nsubject to certain estimates and assumptions made at the balance sheet date which could lead the overall\nsurplus available to change.\nSchemes currently in an accounting surplus position total \u00a320.8m (December 2021: \u00a319.0m) and schemes\ncurrently in an accounting deficit position total \u00a331.6m (December 2021: \u00a327.3m).\nF-85 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\u202f(Continued)\n10.

shall be calculated in\nsuch a manner as will ensure that, after taking into account: (A) any Tax required to be deducted or\nwithheld from the Payment (save to the extent that Parent has not provided a W-8BEN-E when it was\nentitled to do so, and provision of a W-8BEN-E would have prevented such deduction or withholding\nbeing required) and any additional amounts required to be paid by the payer of the Payment in\nconsequence of such withholding\u037e (B) the amount and timing of any additional Tax which becomes (or\nwould become, but for the use of any credit or other relief which would otherwise have been available to\nreduce the Tax liabilities of any member of the recipient\u2019s Group) payable by the recipient of the\nPayment as a result of the Payment\u2019s being chargeable to Tax in the hands of that person\u037e and (C) the\namount and timing of any Tax benefit which is obtained by the recipient of the Payment (or any member\nof the recipient\u2019s Group) to the extent that such Tax benefit is attributable to the matter giving rise to the\nobligation to make the Payment or the receipt of the Payment (for which purposes, for the avoidance of\ndoubt, in the case of a reimbursement under Section 10.03(k)(ii)(C) or under Section 10.03(k)(2)(e) of the\nCompany Disclosure Schedule, the matter giving rise to the obligation to make the Payment is a\nreference to the irrecoverable VAT or increased irrecoverable VAT attributable to the relevant Parent\nPayment), the recipient of the Payment is in the same position as that in which it would have been if the\nmatter giving rise to the obligation to make a Payment had not occurred, provided that if any party to\nthis Agreement shall have assigned or novated the benefit of this Agreement in whole or in part or shall,\nafter the date of this Agreement, have changed its Tax residence or the permanent establishment to\nwhich the rights under this Agreement are allocated then no Payment to that party shall be increased by\nreason of the operation of clauses (A) through (C) (inclusive) to any greater extent than would have\nbeen the case had no such assignment, novation or change taken place. In this Section 10.03(n),\nreferences to \u201cTax\u201d shall exclude \u201cVAT\u201d and references to a \u201cW-8BEN-E\u201d shall mean a properly\ncompleted and executed IRS Form W-8BEN-E, on which the Company is entitled to rely, claiming the\nbenefits of, and establishing an exemption to withholding under, the income tax treaty between the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom prior to such Payment.\nA-84",

If a member dies, the survivor or survivors where he was a joint holder, and his\npersonal representatives where he was a sole holder or the only survivor of joint\nholders, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his\ninterest. Nothing in these Articles shall release the estate of a deceased member\n(whether a sole or joint holder) from any liability in respect of any share held by him.\nElections\npermitted\n49. A person becoming entitled by transmission to a share may, on production of any\nevidence as to his entitlement properly required by the board, elect either to become the\nholder of the share or to have another person nominated by him registered as the\ntransferee. If he elects to become the holder he shall send notice to the Company to that\neffect. If he elects to have another person registered and the share is a certificated share,\nhe shall execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person. If he elects to have\nhimself or another person registered and the share is an uncertificated share, he shall\ntake any action the board may require (including without limitation the execution of any\ndocument and the giving of any instruction by means of a relevant system) to enable\nhimself or that person to be registered as the holder of the share. All the provisions of\nthese Articles relating to the transfer of shares apply to that notice or instrument of\ntransfer as if it were an instrument of transfer executed by the member and the death or\nbankruptcy of the member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not\noccurred.\nElections required\n50. The board may at any time send a notice requiring any such person to elect either to\nbe registered himself or to transfer the share. If the notice is not complied with within 60\ndays, the board may after the expiry of that period withhold payment of all dividends or\nother moneys payable in respect of the share until the requirements of the notice have\nbeen complied with.\nRights of persons\nentitled by\ntransmission\n51. A person becoming entitled by transmission to a share shall, on production of any\nevidence as to his entitlement properly required by the board and subject to the\nrequirements of Article 49, have the same rights in relation to the share as he would have\nhad if he were the holder of the share, subject to Article 182. That person may give a\ndischarge for all dividends and other moneys payable in respect of the share, but he\nshall not, before being registered as the holder of the share, be entitled in respect of it to\nreceive notice of, or to attend or vote at, any meeting of the Company or to receive\nnotice of, or to attend or vote at, any separate meeting of the holders of any class of\nshares in the capital of the Company.\nD-10",
