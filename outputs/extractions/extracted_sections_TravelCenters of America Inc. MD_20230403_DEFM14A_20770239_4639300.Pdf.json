The merger cannot be\ncompleted until the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of\n1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d) has expired and any agreement between a party to the merger agreement\nand a governmental authority not to consummate the merger has expired or been terminated, and all other\napprovals under antitrust law have been received. Both TravelCenters and BP filed notifications of the\nmerger with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice under the HSR Act on March 9,\n2023. Accordingly, the initial waiting period will expire on April 10, 2023.\nIn furtherance of the foregoing, (i) BP will take any and all action necessary, including (A) selling or\notherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories\nof assets or businesses of TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries, (B) terminating existing\nrelationships, contractual rights or obligations of TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries, (C)\nterminating any venture or other arrangement, (D) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations\nof TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries or (E) effectuating any other change or restructuring\nof TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries or restricting TravelCenters or BP or their respective\nSubsidiaries\u2019 ability to operate their respective businesses (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or\nstipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with the Federal Trade\nCommission, the Department of Justice, any attorney general of any state of the United States, any other\ncompetition authority of any jurisdiction or any other governmental authority (collectively, \u201cAntitrust\nAuthority\u201d) in connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to\nTravelCenters or BP or its or their businesses or assets by consenting to such action by TravelCenters and,\nprovided, that, any such action may, at the discretion of TravelCenters, be conditioned upon consummation\nof the merger) (each, a \u201cDivestiture Action\u201d) and to ensure that no governmental authority enters any order,\ndecision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law, rule,\nregulation or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the\nconsummation of the merger or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or\notherwise approve the consummation of the merger, fails to do so by the end date (as defined in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement\u201d)\u037e and (ii) neither BP nor its\naffiliates will acquire any interest in any person that primarily derives revenues from lines of business in the\nUnited States similar to TravelCenters\u2019s travel centers, if such action would make it materially more likely that\nthere would arise any impediments under any antitrust law that may be asserted by any governmental\nauthority to the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby as soon as reasonably practicable.\nIn the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging the merger as violative of any\nantitrust law, BP will take all action necessary, including any Divestiture Action to avoid or resolve such\naction. In the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes\nreasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement unlawful or that\nwould restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, BP will take as reasonably promptly as practicable any and all steps\nnecessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to\nthe end date. TravelCenters will cooperate with BP and will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist BP\nin resisting and reducing any Divestiture Action.\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing or anything contrary in the merger agreement, nothing in the\nmerger agreement will require BP to (1) take any Divestiture Action if doing so would result in BP,\nTravelCenters or their respective subsidiaries divesting (by way of sale, separation or otherwise) any\nbusiness or assets if the aggregate annual revenues generated from such businesses or assets in 2022\nexceed $175 million or (2) otherwise take or commit to take any Divestiture Actions that together with actions\nin clause (1) would be reasonably likely to result in a loss of aggregate annual revenues (expressed as a\npositive number) together with an increase in aggregate annual expenses of BP and its Subsidiaries, taken as\na whole, in excess of $175 million.",

The vote is an\nadvisory vote and will not be binding on TravelCenters or the surviving corporation in the merger.\nBecause the merger-related compensation to be paid to the named executive officers in connection with\nthe merger is based on contractual arrangements with the named executive officers and the merger\nagreement, such compensation may be payable, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, if the\nmerger is approved (subject only to the contractual obligations applicable thereto).\nWhat vote is required for TravelCenters\u2019s stockholders to approve the proposal to approve the merger?\nApproval of the proposal to approve the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a\nmajority of the issued and outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock entitled to vote thereon.\nWhat vote is required for TravelCenters\u2019s stockholders to approve the proposal to approve, by non-binding,\nadvisory vote, certain compensation arrangements for TravelCenters\u2019s named executive officers in connection\nwith the merger?\nThe approval of the proposal to approve, by a non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation that may\nbe paid or become payable to TravelCenters\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the merger\nrequires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting.\nWhat vote is required for TravelCenters\u2019s stockholders to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if\nnecessary, to solicit additional proxies if, at the time of the special meeting, there are an insufficient number of\nvotes in favor of approving the merger?\nThe approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if,\nat the time of the special meeting, there are insufficient votes to approve the merger requires the\naffirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting.\n14 \nQ. \nA. \nQ. \nA. \nQ. \nA. \nQ. \nA. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDo any of TravelCenters\u2019s directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be\nin addition to my interests as a stockholder?\nIn considering the recommendation of the TravelCenters Board with respect to the proposal to approve\nthe merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the\nmerger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally.

However, banks, brokerage firms and other nominees are\nprecluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approving non-routine matters, such as\nthe proposals to be considered at the special meeting, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from\nthe beneficial owner of such shares of TravelCenters common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other\nnominees are not empowered to vote those shares of TravelCenters common stock on non-routine\nmatters. If you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares of\nTravelCenters common stock, your shares of TravelCenters common stock will not be voted.\nWho can vote at the special meeting?\nOnly stockholders of record at the close of business on March 23, 2023, the record date for the\ndetermination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting, are entitled to\nnotice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting.

Please return the voting instruction form to your\nbroker, bank, or other nominee to ensure that your vote is counted.

To vote in person at the\nspecial meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank, or other nominee. Follow the\ninstructions from your broker or bank included with these proxy materials or contact your broker or\nbank to request such a proxy form.\nHow many votes do I have?\nEach holder of shares of TravelCenters common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter\nproperly brought before the special meeting for each share of TravelCenters common stock that such\nholder owned as of the close of business on the record date of March 23, 2023. As of the close of\nbusiness on the record date, there were 15,100,265 shares of TravelCenters common stock outstanding\nand entitled to vote, held by 559 holders of record.\nWhat is the quorum requirement?\nUnder the MGCL, the presence in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of\nthe issued and outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock as of the record date and entitled to\nvote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. Abstentions\nand broker non-votes, if any, will be included in determining whether a quorum is present. A broker non-\nvote is a vote that is not cast on a non-routine matter because the shares entitled to cast the vote are\nheld in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, the broker, bank or other nominee lacks\ndiscretionary authority to vote the shares and the broker, bank or other nominee has not received\nvoting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. Because all of the proposals to be voted on\nat the special meeting are \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters, brokers, banks and other nominees will not have\nauthority to vote on any proposals unless instructed, so TravelCenters does not expect there to be any\nbroker non-votes at the special meeting.\nHow do I vote?\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may have your shares of TravelCenters common stock voted on\nmatters presented at the special meeting in any of the following ways:\nIn Person. You may attend the special meeting virtually and cast your vote during the meeting.

        "Background of the Merger": {
            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe TravelCenters Board, together with members of TravelCenters\u2019s senior management, regularly\nreviews and assesses the performance, future growth prospects, business plans and overall strategic\ndirection of TravelCenters, and has considered a variety of strategic alternatives, including continuing to\npursue TravelCenters\u2019s strategy as a standalone company or pursuing potential strategic transactions with\nthird parties, in each case with the goal of maximizing stockholder value.\nOver the course of 2020 and 2021, Jonathan Pertchik, Chief Executive Officer of TravelCenters, in the\nordinary course of business, was introduced to many industry leaders and executives from various\ncompanies, including convenience store companies and oil and gas companies.\nOn May 13, 2021, Mr. Pertchik was introduced to a representative of BP by Barry Richards, President of\nTravelCenters, by email. BP\u2019s representative was seeking to understand areas of common interest between\nBP and TravelCenters, including potential commercial arrangements and, specifically, opportunities regarding\nelectric vehicle charging and low carbon fuels. On the same day, such representative of BP introduced Mr.\nPertchik by email to another representative of BP. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Pertchik and the second BP\nrepresentative spoke by telephone about their companies\u2019 respective sustainability priorities, including\nTravelCenters\u2019s eTA initiative and its focus on alternative energy and sustainability. An additional\nrepresentative of BP was subsequently introduced to Mr. Pertchik, also by email. Subsequently, Mr. Pertchik\nasked Dennis King, SVP of Corporate Development for TravelCenters, to follow up with such representative\nof BP to explore opportunities for the two companies in the area of sustainable energy. On June 21, 2021, Mr.\nKing and a representative of BP spoke for the first time and continued to speak from time to time through\n2021 and into early 2022 about sustainable energy opportunities that might benefit both companies, but there\nwere no discussions regarding a potential acquisition.\nOn August 20, 2021, a subsidiary of TravelCenters and BP entered into a confidentiality agreement in\nconnection with discussions about potential commercial relationship opportunities.\nIn early February 2022, Mr. Pertchik and representatives of BP met in person to further discuss potential\ncommercial opportunities, including opportunities within the sustainable and alternative energy markets.\nDuring this meeting, the parties discussed broader initiatives, including the potential for a more\ncomprehensive strategic relationship. On April 4, 2022, Mr. Pertchik and a representative of BP had a follow-\nup call during which the representative of BP suggested that Mr. Pertchik speak with another BP\nrepresentative. Mr. Pertchik and such other representative of BP subsequently spoke by telephone about a\npotential strategic relationship and determined that the parties should enter into an amended and restated\nconfidentiality agreement prior to further discussions and, subject to entry into that agreement, schedule a\ncall for April 21, 2022.\nIn March 2022, a representative of Party A, a publicly traded, international energy company, contacted\nMr. Pertchik. Following this initial contact, on March 29, 2022, Mr. Pertchik, Adam D. Portnoy, Chair of the\nTravelCenters Board, and several individuals from Party A, held a telephone meeting during which the\n27 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nparties shared ideas regarding a potential strategic relationship. Representatives of Party A and Mr. Pertchik\nhad several subsequent telephone calls to discuss a potential strategic relationship between April 11, 2022,\nand May 11, 2022.\nOn April 4, 2022, a representative of Party B, a publicly traded, international oil and gas company, spoke\nwith Mr. Pertchik by telephone to discuss the possibility of a potential strategic relationship. Mr. Pertchik\nand a representative of Party B had subsequent discussions on July 13, 2022, and October 3, 2022.\nOn April 6, 2022, a representative of Party C, a publicly traded fuel supplier and gasoline station\noperator, spoke with Mr. Pertchik by telephone to discuss the possibility of a potential strategic relationship.\nOn April 7, 2022, following a regularly scheduled meeting of the TravelCenters Board, the directors held\nan executive session without non-director management or advisors. Mr. Portnoy informed the TravelCenters\nBoard that TravelCenters had received unsolicited inquiries from four parties interested in potential strategic\nrelationships, which management understood could potentially include an acquisition of TravelCenters.\nMessrs. Portnoy and Pertchik summarized the inquiries and provided information about each of BP, Party A,\nParty B and Party C. The TravelCenters Board considered the merits of engaging with these parties in light of\nTravelCenters\u2019s current and projected performance. The TravelCenters Board also considered the broader\nmerits and requirements of embarking upon a potential sale process more generally. The TravelCenters Board\nrecognized that the consent of Service Properties Trust (\u201cSVC\u201d), the landlord of most of TravelCenters\u2019s\nproperties, would be required for a potential acquisition because of the resulting transfer of the leases\nbetween TravelCenters and SVC (the \u201cSVC Leases\u201d), and that the creditworthiness of any potential buyer\nwould be of paramount importance to SVC in evaluating such transfer. Following this discussion, the\nTravelCenters Board directed management to continue discussing with BP, Party A and Party B about\npossible strategic transactions, including a possible acquisition of TravelCenters. The TravelCenters Board\ndirected management not to continue to engage with Party C as the TravelCenters Board did not view Party\nC as a credible buyer due to concerns regarding Party C\u2019s creditworthiness and liquidity, and they\nquestioned Party C\u2019s ability to pay a sufficient purchase price.\nOn April 21, 2022, BP and TravelCenters entered into an amended and restated confidentiality\nagreement, which included a standstill provision.\nAlso on April 21, 2022, Mr. Pertchik and Mark Young, TravelCenters\u2019s Executive Vice President and\nGeneral Counsel, and representatives of BP had a call to discuss potential strategic arrangements between\nthe companies, including various commercial opportunities and a possible partnership with, and capital\ninvestment into, TravelCenters to allow BP to, among other things, participate in TravelCenters\u2019s planned\nexpansion into the sectors of sustainable and alternative energy.\nOn May 3, 2022, BP delivered to TravelCenters a written request for certain non-public commercial\ninformation about TravelCenters. In response, TravelCenters provided certain written materials on May 22,\n2022.\nOn May 11, 2022, representatives of TravelCenters and BP had a call to discuss further potential\nstrategic arrangements between the companies.\nOn June 9, 2022, following a regularly scheduled meeting of the TravelCenters Board, the directors held\nan executive session without non-director management or advisors. Mr. Pertchik provided an update on\ndiscussions with Party A and BP. Mr. Pertchik informed the TravelCenters Board that BP was evaluating\nTravelCenters as a potential acquisition target, but that Party A seemed focused on a potential fuel\ndistribution arrangement. Messrs. Portnoy and Pertchik then reviewed TravelCenters\u2019s current and projected\nperformance and responded to questions from the other directors. Following discussion, the TravelCenters\nBoard concluded that management should continue to engage with BP and to allow BP to evaluate\nTravelCenters, and that TravelCenters was not interested in a fuel distribution arrangement with Party A at\nthe time, but should maintain an open dialogue with Party A.\nOn June 10, 2022, TravelCenters entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party A, which included a\nstandstill provision.\n28 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 16, 2022, representatives of TravelCenters and BP held a meeting to discuss BP\u2019s diligence and\na potential strategic transaction between TravelCenters and BP. During the meeting, representatives of BP\nindicated that BP might be interested in making an offer to acquire TravelCenters.\nOn June 17, 2022, Mr. Pertchik met telephonically with representatives of Party A. The representatives of\nParty A indicated that they had interest in a broader strategic relationship and possible acquisition, however\ntheir primary interest was in expanding their fuel distribution, particularly the distribution of diesel fuel. Mr.\nPertchik\u2019s view was that it was unlikely that a fuel distribution agreement would be advantageous to\nTravelCenters.\nOn June 28, 2022, Messrs. Pertchik and Portnoy and a representative of BP discussed the relationship\nbetween TravelCenters and SVC and whether SVC would consider amending the SVC Leases to\naccommodate certain business imperatives of BP.\nOn July 2, 2022, BP delivered to TravelCenters a written request for certain non-public commercial\ninformation about TravelCenters. In response, TravelCenters provided certain written materials throughout\nthe course of late-July through September 2022, and representatives of BP and TravelCenters periodically\nheld telephonic meetings to discuss a potential transaction.\nOn July 20, 2022, TravelCenters executed a second amended and restated confidentiality agreement with\nBP, which, among other things, added SVC and The RMR Group LLC (\u201cRMR\u201d) as parties. The amended and\nrestated confidentiality agreement contained a standstill provision.\nOn July 25, 2022, representatives of BP met with representatives of TravelCenters, SVC and RMR.\nDuring this meeting, BP expressed interest in a potential acquisition of TravelCenters, asked questions of the\nSVC representatives related to the SVC Leases and inquired whether SVC would be willing to sell some or all\nof the leased properties to BP. BP informed TravelCenters and SVC of general business priorities it would\nhave related to amending the SVC Leases in connection with a potential acquisition. BP further inquired\nwhether SVC would be willing to sell some or all of the tradenames and trademarks it owned that were\nassociated with TravelCenters\u2019s business. BP also inquired about the business management and shared\nservices arrangement between TravelCenters and RMR.\nFrom time to time from June 2022 through October 2022, representatives of TravelCenters and BP had\nconversations relating to a potential transaction.\nOn September 19, 2022, following a regularly scheduled meeting of the TravelCenters Board, the\ndirectors held an executive session without non-director management or advisors. Mr. Portnoy noted that\nTravelCenters had continued to engage with BP to facilitate BP\u2019s evaluation of a potential acquisition of\nTravelCenters but did not believe an offer would be forthcoming at this time. Mr. Pertchik informed the\nTravelCenters Board that there had not been any further substantive discussions with Party A since mid-\nJune. Messrs. Portnoy and Pertchik then reviewed TravelCenters\u2019s current and projected performance and\nresponded to questions from the other directors. After a discussion, the TravelCenters Board determined to\nengage a financial advisor to help it evaluate a potential sale of TravelCenters and, if the TravelCenters\nBoard determined to pursue a sale, to advise the TravelCenters Board. The TravelCenters Board directed\nmanagement to engage Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\u201cCiti\u201d) as its financial advisor based on Citi\u2019s\nfamiliarity with the Company and the industries in which TravelCenters operates, its expertise with\ntransactions of this type, and Citi\u2019s prior engagements with TravelCenters.\nOn October 4, 2022, Citi met with TravelCenters management to discuss potential timing and process for\na potential sale of TravelCenters. Citi delivered a presentation regarding several topics in connection with a\npotential sale, including a proposed timeline, marketing materials and the diligence process.\nBetween October 4, 2022, and late-October, TravelCenters management and Citi prepared a confidential\ninformation memorandum to share with potential bidders and compiled diligence information to be provided\nin a virtual data room.\nIn mid-October 2022, a representative of BP proposed to Mr. Pertchik a meeting with TravelCenters\nmanagement to continue discussions about a potential transaction.\n29 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn or about October 20, 2022, Messrs. Portnoy and Pertchik had a telephone meeting with\nrepresentatives of BP, who noted that BP remained interested in acquiring TravelCenters. The parties\ndiscussed potential timing and other details of the process and agreed to remain in contact.\nOn October 26, 2022, representatives of Citi informed a representative of BP that a potential process may\nbegin soon for a potential transaction with TravelCenters, and a representative of BP indicated its interest in\nbeing included in the initial outreach for the process.\nOn October 28, 2022, the TravelCenters Board held a meeting, with members of TravelCenters\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Citi and Ropes & Gray LLP, the Company\u2019s outside counsel (\u201cRopes &\nGray\u201d), in attendance. Mr. Portnoy described discussions with BP since the TravelCenters Board\u2019s last\nmeeting and explained that management had been working with Citi to assemble a confidential information\nmemorandum, to populate a virtual data room and to prepare to run a sales process if the TravelCenters\nBoard determined to proceed. Mr. Portnoy also noted that SVC\u2019s board of trustees had discussed the\npotential transaction and had indicated that it would consider consenting to the transfer of the leases and\nguarantees to certain counterparties if it was satisfied with the potential party\u2019s creditworthiness. SVC also\nindicated that, although it was not interested in selling any of the TravelCenters real estate at this time, it\nwould consider reasonable amendments to the SVC Leases and guarantees for a satisfactory counter party.\nCiti then described a potential timeline for a sales process and identified 11 potential counterparties based on\ntheir likely strategic interest and credit and financial capability. Citi explained that management directed Citi\nto contact only strategic parties with strong credit profiles pre-approved by SVC because (i) SVC was\nunlikely to provide its consent for a financial buyer or strategic party that required significant financing, as\nsuch buyers would present greater risk of default as a lessee and (ii) a counterparty with a strong credit\nrating would be more likely to be able to consummate the transaction given the current financing market. As\na result, the minimum credit rating for any counterparty to be contacted by Citi was BBB/ Baa2. Citi\nresponded to questions from the TravelCenters Board about the process and timing and, following\ndiscussion, the TravelCenters Board directed Citi to contact each of the proposed strategic parties beginning\non October 31, 2022, and to coordinate with management to solicit indications of interest. The TravelCenters\nBoard also discussed the terms of Citi\u2019s engagement letter and ratified the terms of the engagement.\nDuring the week of October 31, 2022, Citi contacted the 11 parties authorized by the TravelCenters\nBoard and subsequently provided draft confidentiality agreements to eight of the parties. Following\nnegotiations, between November 9, 2022 and November 14, 2022, TravelCenters entered into confidentiality\nagreements with Party D, a privately held international operator of gas stations and convenience stores,\nParty E, a publicly traded international operator of gas stations and convenience stores, and Party F, a\nsubsidiary of an international energy company, each of which had a standstill provision. The other parties\ncontacted by Citi ultimately declined to sign a confidentiality agreement and did not pursue an acquisition of\nTravelCenters.\nOn November 3, 2022, BP was granted access to a virtual data room that held, among other things,\nlimited non-public documentation on TravelCenters\u2019s financials, leases, contracts and debt (the \u201cRound I\nVDR\u201d). Promptly following their execution of confidentiality agreements, Parties D, E and F also received\naccess to the Round I VDR.\nBetween October 31, 2022, and December 13, 2022, TravelCenters responded to a variety of diligence\nrequests from the potential counterparties. Citi held brief meetings with the counterparties to respond to\nquestions and gauge interest. After BP entered into a supplemental clean team confidentiality agreement with\nTravelCenters on December 6, 2022, TravelCenters also provided access to a separate data room (the \u201cClean\nRoom\u201d) containing certain competitively sensitive information to representatives of and advisors to BP who\ndo not have responsibility for competitive business decisions for their respective employer or client.\nOn December 1, 2022, Party D informed Citi that it would no longer pursue an acquisition of\nTravelCenters.\nOn December 12, 2022, the TravelCenters Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of\nTravelCenters\u2019s management and representatives of Ropes & Gray in attendance. Mr. Portnoy provided an\nupdate on discussions with potential acquirors, identifying which parties had entered into confidentiality\n30 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nagreements, which had notified Citi or TravelCenters they did not intend to proceed in the process, and\nwhich were likely to submit proposals. Following the update, the TravelCenters Board discussed the timing\nand process for the potential sale of TravelCenters, including the need for SVC to consent to the transaction\nand likely negotiate lease amendments with any potential buyer. The TravelCenters Board agreed to hold a\nmeeting later in the week after initial proposals were received.\nOn December 13, 2022, TravelCenters received written non-binding proposals from Party E and BP. The\nParty E proposal contemplated a purchase of 100% of the equity interests of TravelCenters for $71.00 per\nshare in cash (the \u201cParty E Initial Proposal\u201d). The BP proposal contemplated a purchase of 100% of the\nequity interests of TravelCenters for $60.00 per share in cash (the \u201cBP Initial Proposal\u201d). The BP Initial\nProposal also summarized proposed modifications to the SVC Leases and noted an interest in retention of\nTravelCenters\u2019s employees including the management team. Also on December 13, 2022, Party F notified Citi\nthat it would no longer pursue an acquisition of TravelCenters.\nOn December 15, 2022, Party A notified Citi that it would not pursue a transaction with TravelCenters.\nOn December 16, 2022, the TravelCenters Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of\nTravelCenters\u2019s management and representatives of Citi and Ropes & Gray in attendance. Citi summarized\nthe terms of the written non-binding proposals received from Party E and BP, including their proposed\npurchase prices and other material terms and noted that the BP Initial Proposal set forth proposed\namendments to the SVC Leases while the Party E Initial Proposal did not. Citi noted that the other parties\nwho signed confidentiality agreements had elected not to pursue the transaction at this time and would not\nsubmit proposals. Citi then described discussions that Citi had with BP following receipt of the BP Initial\nProposal, including advising BP that its proposed purchase price was not compelling. Mr. Portnoy described\nBP\u2019s feedback on the SVC Leases in more detail and noted for the TravelCenters Board that SVC was aware\nof the identity of the bidders and Mr. Portnoy planned to preview BP\u2019s lease proposals with SVC\u2019s board of\ntrustees before TravelCenters responded to the bids. Mr. Portnoy and Citi responded to questions from the\ndirectors and, after discussing the next steps in the process, the TravelCenters Board directed TravelCenters\nmanagement and advisors to continue pursuing a transaction, including providing BP and Party E with\naccess to additional diligence materials and a draft merger agreement, as well as hosting meetings for both\nparties with management.\nOn December 17, 2022, representatives of Citi informed representatives of Goldman, Sachs & Co. (\u201cGS\u201d),\nBP\u2019s financial advisor, that BP would be moving on to the next round of the process. Representatives of Citi\ntold representatives of GS that BP would be moving on even though its bid was well below a price at which\nthe TravelCenters Board indicated TravelCenters would be willing to enter into a transaction, and that BP\u2019s\nstrong balance sheet and creditworthiness, while viewed highly positively, did not distinguish its bid as\nother bidders shared the same attributes.\nOn December 22, 2022, at the direction of the TravelCenters Board, TravelCenters granted BP and Party\nE access to an expanded data room that contained substantially all of the documentation TravelCenters\nmanagement determined was necessary for potential bidders to complete their diligence of TravelCenters and\nits operations (the \u201cRound II VDR\u201d), and on December 23, 2022, TravelCenters granted Party E and its\nfinancial and legal advisors who do not have responsibility for competitive business decisions for their\nrespective employer or client access to the Clean Room.\nOn January 9, 2023 and January 10, 2023, representatives of Citi reached out to both representatives of\nBP and GS to provide certain bidding instructions and to emphasize that BP would need to substantially\nincrease its price in order to be able to acquire TravelCenters and indicated BP should put forward its best\nbid.\nOn January 10, 2023, as directed by the TravelCenters Board, Ropes & Gray posted the draft merger\nagreement to the Round II VDR for potential bidders to review and comment upon.\nAlso, on January 10, 2023, as directed by the TravelCenters Board, Citi sent a formal process letter to BP\nand Party E, which requested that each party submit revised drafts of the draft merger agreement, which was\nposted to the Round II VDR on January 10, and Lease Documentation (as defined below), on or before\nFebruary 1, 2023, and to submit final proposals, including a proposed per share purchase price, by February\n7, 2023.\n31 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn January 12, 2023, as directed by SVC, Citi posted to the Round II VDR a draft Consent and\nAmendment Agreement, which provided that (i) SVC would consent to the entry by TravelCenters into the\nmerger agreement and any resulting change in control of TravelCenters resulting from the proposed merger\ntransaction, (ii) simultaneously with the closing of the transaction, a subsidiary of TravelCenters, and certain\nsubsidiaries of SVC would amend and restate the SVC Leases and an affiliate of the potential buyer and\ncertain subsidiaries of SVC would amend and restate the guarantees by TravelCenters in respect thereof, and\n(iii) simultaneously with the closing of the transaction, the SVC parties would sell certain trademarks to\nTravelCenters for an amount equal to their net book value of $89.4 million (the \u201cConsent and Amendment\nAgreement\u201d). Citi, as directed by SVC, also posted drafts of the amended and restated SVC Leases that\nwould be entered into pursuant to the Consent and Amendment Agreement (the \u201cAmended and Restated\nLeases\u201d) and the guarantees that would be amended pursuant to the Consent and Amendment Agreement\n(the \u201cAmended and Restated Guarantees\u201d, together with the Amended and Restated Leases and the Consent\nand Amendment Agreement, the \u201cLease Documentation\u201d).\nOn January 18, 2023, TravelCenters management, including Messrs. Pertchik, Crage and Young, and\nrepresentatives of Citi made a presentation to members of BP\u2019s management in Cleveland, Ohio regarding\nTravelCenters\u2019s business and Mr. Pertchik conducted a tour for BP of one of TravelCenters\u2019s local travel\ncenters.\nBetween January 18, 2023, and January 26, 2023, TravelCenters and Party E participated in due diligence\nsessions, relating to business and financial, technology, IT, procurement, legal and insurance matters among\nother topics. On January 20, 2023, TravelCenters management, including Messrs. Pertchik, Crage and Young,\nand representatives of Citi made a presentation to members of Party E\u2019s management in Cleveland, Ohio and\nMr. Pertchik conducted a tour for Party E of one of TravelCenters\u2019s local travel centers.\nOn January 23, 2023, Citi met with representatives of BP to discuss TravelCenters\u2019s financial model,\ncapital expenditure spending, and growth rate assumptions in TravelCenters\u2019s model.\nOn January 25, 2023, Messrs. Portnoy and Pertchik and a representative of Citi hosted a dinner meeting\nin Boston, Massachusetts with representatives of BP. During the dinner, they discussed the potential\ntransaction, TravelCenters\u2019s business plans and BP\u2019s strategic plan for TravelCenters.\nOn January 27, 2023, the TravelCenters Board met, with members of TravelCenters\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Citi and Ropes & Gray in attendance. Mr. Portnoy provided an update on the process,\nnoting that, as directed by the TravelCenters Board, TravelCenters management and its advisors continued\nto work closely with BP and Party E and that there was extensive engagement from senior management at\nboth counterparties. Mr. Portnoy then described the management presentations and site visits with BP and\nParty E and highlighted the meeting Mr. Portnoy and Mr. Pertchik had with representatives of BP and how\nthe meeting reinforced BP\u2019s interest. Mr. Portnoy also noted that he expected each party to submit updated\nnon-binding proposals on or before the February 7, 2023, deadline set forth in the process letter. Messrs.\nPertchik and Portnoy and Citi responded to questions from the directors and the TravelCenters Board\nengaged in extensive discussion.\nOn January 31, 2023, representatives of Citi, TravelCenters management and BP management held a\nmeeting about TravelCenters\u2019s liquified natural gas capabilities.\nOn February 1, 2023, both BP and Party E submitted comments on the merger agreement to Ropes &\nGray. BP also submitted detailed comments on the Lease Documentation, but Party E submitted only a\ngeneral issues list with respect to the Lease Documentation.\nOn February 3, 2023, representatives of Citi and GS discussed the upcoming submission deadline. Citi\nstrongly encouraged GS to work with BP to put its best price in its submission based on the TravelCenters\nBoard\u2019s current intention that there would not be a third round of the process and that TravelCenters\u2019s\nintent was to select the best offer and move expeditiously to finalize transaction documents following the\nsecond round bids.\nOn February 5, 2023, as directed by the TravelCenters Board, Ropes & Gray posted a draft of\nTravelCenters\u2019s disclosure schedules to the Round II VDR.\n32 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 7, 2023, TravelCenters received non-binding written proposals from both Party E and BP.\nThe Party E proposal contemplated a purchase of 100% of the equity interests of TravelCenters for $68.00 per\nshare in cash (the \u201cParty E Final Proposal\u201d). The Party E Final Proposal noted that Party E had outstanding\ndiligence requests but expected to be able to complete its review within thirty days. The BP proposal\ncontemplated a purchase of 100% of the equity interests of TravelCenters for $86.00 per share in cash (the\n\u201cBP Final Proposal\u201d). The BP Final Proposal noted that the diligence process was substantially complete.\nNeither party provided updated drafts of the merger agreement or Lease Documentation with their respective\nfinal proposals.\nOn February 8, 2023, ahead of a TravelCenters Board meeting, representatives of Citi provided Citi\u2019s\nrelationship disclosure letter to TravelCenters.\nAlso on February 8, 2023, the TravelCenters Board met, with members of TravelCenters\u2019s management\nand representatives of Citi and Ropes & Gray in attendance. The TravelCenters Board discussed the BP Final\nProposal and the Party E Final Proposal. Representatives of Ropes & Gray also provided feedback on the BP\nand Party E\u2019s markup of the merger agreement, noting that (i) Party E provided only a partial markup that\nreserved comment on a number of critical terms and provisions and (ii) BP\u2019s detailed markup, among other\npoints, increased the termination fee, proposed an antitrust covenant that capped BP\u2019s potential divestiture\nobligations, provided for an antitrust reverse termination fee, required that voting agreements from SVC and\nRMR be delivered at signing, expanded the interim operating covenants and made certain pro-buyer changes\nto the closing conditions. Following discussions, the TravelCenters Board directed management to negotiate\na transaction with BP.\nOn February 9, 2023, Citi notified BP that TravelCenters would agree to the price proposed in the BP\nFinal Proposal of the Lease Documentation provided that the parties negotiated a satisfactory merger\nagreement and BP and SVC agreed on the terms.\nAlso on February 9, 2023, Ropes & Gray provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to Sullivan &\nCromwell LLP (\u201cSullivan & Cromwell\u201d), counsel to BP, and Sullivan & Worcester LLP (\u201cSullivan &\nWorcester\u201d), counsel to SVC in connection with the Lease Documentation, sent revised drafts of the Lease\nDocumentation to Sullivan & Cromwell. In the revised merger agreement, Ropes & Gray generally accepted\non TravelCenters\u2019s behalf the requirement of voting agreements and the antitrust framework of a divestiture\ncap and reverse termination fee but continued to negotiate the size of the divestiture cap, the size of BP\u2019s\ntermination fee as well as the Company\u2019s termination fee, certain other provisions including the interim\noperating covenants, the closing conditions, representations and warranties and the company termination\nfee triggers. In the Lease Documentation, Sullivan & Worcester proposed revisions, among other terms, to\nthe guarantor creditworthiness requirements, limitation on guarantor liability, length of the fixed and\nextended lease terms, mineral rights, holdover penalties, periodic financial information disclosures and\nconfidentiality provisions.\nBetween February 11, 2023, and February 15, 2023, the parties and their legal and financial advisors\nengaged in negotiations regarding, and exchanged drafts of, the proposed merger agreement and disclosure\nschedules, as well as drafts of the form of voting agreement and the Consent and Amendment Agreement\nand related Lease Documentation. In negotiating the merger agreement, the parties, working with their legal\nand financial advisors, agreed on the termination fees, triggers, outside date and certain other terms with\nrespect to the interim operating covenants, the closing conditions, and the representations and warranties.\nAs to Lease Documentation, the parties agreed to, among other things, the requirement that the guarantor\nhave either a net worth exceeding $15 billion, a credit rating of at least BBB- or Baa2, or otherwise have a\ncreditworthiness that is acceptable to SVC, holdover rent on a property-by-property basis and an indemnity\nfor certain damages resulting from holdover, and a confidentiality provision that allowed for required\nsecurities disclosures. As to the voting agreement, the parties agreed on resolutions of certain outstanding\nnegotiated points regarding the ability of RMR and SVC to make public announcements, and removal of\nreliance and legal proxy provisions. Lastly, the parties finalized the terms of the Consent and Amendment\nAgreement. With these issues resolved, the SVC and RMR boards agreed to enter into the voting agreement\nand the SVC board agreed to enter into the Consent and Amendment Agreement.\nOn February 15, 2023, the TravelCenters Board met, with members of TravelCenters\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Citi, Ropes & Gray and Venable LLP, Maryland counsel to TravelCenters (\u201cVenable\u201d),\n33 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npresent. At the meeting, Ropes & Gray reviewed the terms and conditions of the transaction documents,\nincluding the structure, closing conditions, antitrust and divestiture covenant, interim operating covenants,\nrepresentations and warranties, non-solicitation covenant, termination rights and fees, and end date\nextensions. Venable then summarized for the TravelCenters Board its duties as directors under Maryland\ncorporate law in the context of the potential transaction. Citi then reviewed its financial analysis of the\nmerger consideration and delivered to the TravelCenters Board its oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a\nwritten opinion dated February 15, 2023, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Citi\nin preparing its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of TravelCenters common\nstock is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of TravelCenters common stock (other than (i) BP\nand its affiliates, or (ii) RMR or any entities managed by or that receive business management services from\nRMR, including SVC or any of their respective affiliates), as more fully described below in the section \u201c-\nOpinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\u201d Following discussions about the proposed transaction with BP,\nincluding the potential merits and considerations for and against proceeding with it described further in the\nsection \u201c\u202f-\u202fRecommendation of the TravelCenters Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,\u201d the\nTravelCenters Board unanimously (i) determined and declared that the terms of the merger agreement, the\nAncillary Agreements (as defined in the merger agreement), the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated thereby are advisable and in the best interests of TravelCenters and TravelCenters\u2019s\nstockholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the\nAncillary Agreements and, subject to the Company stockholder approval, the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated thereby (including the merger) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set\nforth therein, (iii) directed that the approval of the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement be submitted to a vote of the holders of TravelCenters common stock at a meeting of\nTravelCenters\u2019s stockholders and (iv) resolved to include in this proxy statement the recommendation of the\nTravelCenters Board to the holders of TravelCenters common stock to vote in favor of approval of the\nmerger by the TravelCenters\u2019s stockholders.\nOn February 15, 2023, following the approval by the TravelCenters Board of the merger agreement, the\nparties executed the merger agreement, the Consent and Amendment Agreement, the voting agreements and\nthe other documentation related to the merger.\nOn the morning of February 16, 2023, TravelCenters and BP p.l.c. each issued a press release\nannouncing the transaction and a representative from Citi notified Party E of the transaction.\nOn March 14, 2023, TravelCenters received an unsolicited, non-binding indication of interest from\nARKO Corp. (\u201cARKO\u201d), a publicly traded fuel supplier and convenience store operator to purchase 100% of\nthe equity interests of TravelCenters for $92.00 per share (the \u201cARKO Proposal\u201d). The ARKO Proposal\nindicated that ARKO planned to finance the purchase through a combination of cash on hand, external\nfinancing and lines of credit and contemplated a 30 day timeline to conduct diligence and sign definitive\nagreements. ARKO indicated that they were prepared to enter into the Lease Documentation under\nsubstantially the same terms as BP entered into, including entering into restated guarantees of leases on\nsubstantially the same terms as those set forth in the Consent and Amendment Agreement which would\ninclude having ARKO as the guarantor. The ARKO Proposal also included a letter from a potential financing\nsource indicating that \u201csubject to certain terms and conditions, including pricing\u201d it was prepared to commit\nto finance the acquisition.\nOn March 15, TravelCenters informed BP of the receipt of the ARKO Proposal pursuant to its\nnotification obligations under the merger agreement.\nOn March 17, 2023, the TravelCenters Board met, with members of TravelCenters\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Citi, Ropes & Gray and Venable in attendance. Mr. Portnoy described the ARKO Proposal,\na copy of which had been circulated to the TravelCenters Board in advance of the meeting, and shared\ncertain publicly available information about ARKO. A representative of Ropes & Gray described the\nrestrictions imposed by the merger agreement on TravelCenters\u2019s and its representatives\u2019 ability to discuss\nthe ARKO Proposal with ARKO and its representatives and certain factors the TravelCenters Board should\nconsider in evaluating whether the ARKO Proposal may constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead\nto a Superior Proposal (as defined in the merger agreement). A representative of Venable then summarized the\ndirectors\u2019 duties under Maryland law in the context of the ARKO Proposal. The TravelCenters Board\n34 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nengaged in a discussion of the ARKO Proposal and its impact on the merger agreement and process with BP,\nand Mr. Portnoy and the advisors to the TravelCenters Board responded to questions from the directors.\nFollowing discussion, the TravelCenters Board determined to meet again the following week to again discuss\nthe ARKO Proposal and requested that TravelCenters\u2019s management and the advisors gather certain\ninformation, including information regarding ARKO and the ARKO Proposal, to help inform their\ndeliberations.\nOn March 22, 2023, the TravelCenters Board met, with members of TravelCenters\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Citi, Ropes & Gray and Venable in attendance. Mr. Portnoy reminded the TravelCenters\nBoard of the terms and conditions of the ARKO Proposal and presented certain general information about\nARKO\u2019s financial condition and business. Mr. Portnoy also provided an update about the status of the\ntransaction with BP, including that the parties had filed notifications of the merger with the Federal Trade\nCommission and Department of Justice under the HSR Act on March 9, 2023, and the initial 30 day review\nperiod expires on April 10, 2023. Mr. Portnoy further advised the TravelCenters Board that SVC\u2019s board of\ntrustees, and all of its independent trustees, had reached a preliminary consensus, that given ARKO\u2019s credit\nrating and financial conditions, SVC would not engage in negotiations with or consent to the assignment of\nthe Lease Documentation to ARKO in connection with a change of control of TravelCenters. A\nrepresentative of Venable summarized the directors\u2019 duties under Maryland law in the context of the ARKO\nProposal. The TravelCenters Board\u2019s advisors responded to questions from the directors and the directors\ndiscussed their views on the ARKO Proposal. The independent directors then held an executive session with\ntheir advisors and without TravelCenters\u2019s managing directors or other management. The independent\ndirectors further discussed ARKO and the ARKO Proposal\u2019s terms and conditions and asked additional\nquestions of their advisors. Following discussion, the independent directors concluded that the ARKO\nProposal did not constitute a Superior Proposal and could not reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior\nProposal. The independent directors identified, among other reasons for their conclusion, that, despite\nARKO proposing a higher per share price than BP has agreed to pay, (i) the ARKO Proposal indicated that\nARKO would require significant third-party financing and there was no firm commitment from a potential\nfinancing source to provide such financing and the financing markets remain uncertain\u037e (ii) ARKO indicated\nthat it would require approximately 30 days to complete diligence and enter into definitive agreements, which\nwould delay consummation of a potential sale of TravelCenters and during which time the pending\ntransaction would remain subject to risks related to the performance of each counterparty and\nmacroeconomic factors\u037e (iii) ARKO indicated that, subject to diligence, it may enter into definitive\ntransaction agreements substantially similar to those executed by BP, but did not provide draft agreements or\nproposed changes for the TravelCenters Board\u2019s consideration\u037e (iv) the TravelCenters Board has determined\nthat BP\u2019s commitment to take certain actions to satisfy the requirements under the HSR Act provides\nsignificant deal certainty whereas, based on information in the ARKO Proposal and public information, the\nTravelCenters Board cannot conclude that the potential regulatory risks related to the ARKO Proposal could\nbe similarly mitigated to provide similar deal certainty\u037e (v) the only regulatory closing condition in the merger\nagreement relates to the HSR Act, but ARKO stated it would need to obtain \u201call required governmental and\nregulatory authorization\u201d to consummate the transaction which would cause further delay and uncertainty\u037e\nand (vi) the SVC board, including all of the SVC independent trustees, had reached a preliminary consensus\nthat because of ARKO\u2019s credit rating and financial condition, SVC would not consent to the assignment of\nleases or accept ARKO or its affiliates as a guarantor. Following the executive session, the full TravelCenters\nBoard reconvened with TravelCenters\u2019s management and, following discussion, unanimously determined,\nincluding for the reasons outlined above, that the ARKO Proposal does not constitute a Superior Proposal\nand could not reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal. The TravelCenters Board then directed\nTravelCenters\u2019s management to notify ARKO and BP of its conclusion.\nOn March 22, 2023, TravelCenters delivered to ARKO a letter in response to the ARKO Proposal (the\n\u201cTA Response Letter\u201d). The TA Response Letter communicated the TravelCenters Board\u2019s determination that\nthe ARKO Proposal did not constitute a Superior Proposal and could not reasonably be expected to lead to a\nSuperior Proposal and, therefore, TravelCenters and its representatives were contractually prohibited by the\nmerger agreement from participating in discussions related to the ARKO Proposal.\nOn March 27, 2023, TravelCenters received an additional letter from ARKO that restated the terms of the\nARKO Proposal and asked the TravelCenters Board to reconsider the ARKO Proposal (the \u201cMarch 27 ARKO\nLetter\u201d). Simultaneously with sending the March 27 ARKO Letter, ARKO (i) issued a press release\n35",

            "text": "Recommendation of the TravelCenters Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger\nThe TravelCenters Board recommends that TravelCenters stockholders vote (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to\napprove the merger, (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, by a non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation\nthat may be paid or become payable to TravelCenters\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the\nmerger and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adjourn the special meeting of TravelCenters stockholders, if\nnecessary, to solicit additional proxies if, at the time of the special meeting, there are insufficient votes to\napprove the merger.\nAt a meeting held on February 15, 2023, the TravelCenters Board unanimously (i) determined and\ndeclared that the terms of the merger agreement, the Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the merger\nagreement), the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and in the best\ninterests of TravelCenters and TravelCenters\u2019s stockholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and\nperformance of the merger agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and, subject to the Company stockholder\napproval, the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby (including the merger) upon the terms\nand\n36 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsubject to the conditions set forth therein, (iii) directed that the approval of the merger and other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement be submitted to a vote of the holders of TravelCenters\ncommon stock at a meeting of TravelCenters\u2019s stockholders and (iv) resolved to include in this proxy\nstatement the recommendation of the TravelCenters Board to the holders of TravelCenters common stock to\nvote in favor of approval of the merger by the TravelCenters\u2019s stockholders.\nIn reaching its recommendation that TravelCenters stockholders vote for the proposal to approve the\nmerger, the TravelCenters Board consulted with TravelCenters management, Citi, and Ropes & Gray and\nconsidered a number of reasons, including the following non-exhaustive list of reasons (not included in any\nrelative order of importance) that the TravelCenters Board believes support its determination and\nrecommendation:\nBusiness and Financial Condition of TravelCenters. The TravelCenters Board considered TravelCenters\u2019s\ncurrent and historical financial condition, results of operations, business, competitive position,\nproperties, assets and prospects, as well as TravelCenters\u2019s long-range plan. The TravelCenters\nBoard weighed the certainty of stockholders realizing a compelling value for shares of\nTravelCenters\u2019s common stock in the merger compared to the uncertainty that trading values would\napproach the per share merger consideration in the foreseeable future and the risk and uncertainty\nassociated with TravelCenters and its business. The TravelCenters Board also believed that the\nacquisition of TravelCenters by BP for $86.00 per TravelCenters share in cash was more favorable to\nTravelCenters\u2019s stockholders than the value of remaining an independent public company. The\nTravelCenters Board reached this conclusion because of, among other things, (i) the uncertainty in\nthe market, including the potential decrease in demand for trucking services, which could be\nadversely affected by a recession and/or inflationary pressures, (ii) environmental regulations and\nincreased compliance costs, (iii) the market reaction to climate change and decreasing demand for\ndiesel, (iv) the volatility of the oil and gas industry, especially given recent fluctuations as a result of\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and (v) increasing motor vehicle fuel efficiency, fuel conservation\npractices and adoption of alternative fuels or energy sources.\nImplied Premium. The TravelCenters Board considered that the per share merger consideration\nrepresented an approximately 74% premium over TravelCenters\u2019s closing share price on February 15,\n2023. The TravelCenters Board considered that, following a thorough and competitive bid process, in\nits view, it had obtained BP\u2019s best and final offer and that, as of the date of the merger agreement, the\nper share merger consideration represented the highest per share merger consideration reasonably\nobtainable.\nPer Share Merger Consideration. The TravelCenters Board considered the fact that 100% of the merger\nconsideration will be paid in cash at the closing of the merger, which provides TravelCenters\nstockholders with immediate liquidity and a high degree of certainty of value.\nPotentially Interested Counterparties. The TravelCenters Board considered, with the benefit of its\ninvestor and industry expertise, after discussing with Citi and management of TravelCenters, (i) the\nresults of the process that had been conducted to solicit proposals for alternative transactions and\nthe resulting discussions and negotiations and (ii) the fact that none of these discussions or\nnegotiations resulted in a better proposal. The TravelCenters Board also considered the ability of\nother creditworthy bidders to make proposals at higher prices per share than the BP offer price.\nStrategic Alternatives. The TravelCenters Board considered, after discussions with Citi, possible\nalternatives to the merger, including the execution of management\u2019s standalone plan and the risks\nassociated with this alternative. The TravelCenters Board determined not to pursue strategic\nalternatives in light of its belief that the merger is more favorable to TravelCenters\u2019s stockholders\nthan such alternatives. The TravelCenters Board also considered its belief that the value offered to\nholders of shares of TravelCenters common stock in the merger was more favorable to holders of\nTravelCenters common stock than the risk-adjusted value of remaining an independent public\ncompany.\nCertain Management Projections. The TravelCenters Board considered certain prospective forecasts for\nTravelCenters prepared by senior management of TravelCenters, which reflect an application of\nvarious commercial assumptions of TravelCenters\u2019s senior management. For further discussion, see\nthe section entitled \u201c- Certain Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 47.\n37 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCiti\u2019s Fairness Opinion and Related Analyses. The TravelCenters Board considered the financial\npresentation, analyses and oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion,\ndated February 15, 2023, of Citi to the TravelCenters Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of\nview and as of the date of the written opinion, of the merger consideration to be received by the\nholders (other than (i) BP and its affiliates or (ii) RMR or any entities managed by or that receive\nbusiness management services from RMR, including SVC, or any of their respective affiliates) of\noutstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, which opinion\nwas based on and subject to the assumptions made, qualifications, limitations and other matters\nconsidered on the review undertaken by Citi in rendering its opinion as more fully described below in\nthe section entitled \u201cOpinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\u201d beginning on page 41.\nLikelihood of Completion. The TravelCenters Board considered the likelihood that the merger would be\ncompleted based on, among other things (not listed in any relative order of importance):\nthe fact that the conditions to the closing of the merger are specific and limited in scope\u037e\nthe business reputation, experience, expertise and capabilities of BP and its strong track record\nof involvement with capital intensive projects in the energy industry, and the TravelCenters\nBoard\u2019s conclusion that BP is willing to devote the resources necessary to close the merger in an\nexpeditious manner\u037e\nBP\u2019s financial condition and creditworthiness and ability to complete the transaction without\nrequiring additional financing\u037e\nBP\u2019s obligation under the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the\nregulatory approvals necessary to consummate the transaction, including taking certain\nspecified actions if required by regulatory authorities in order to obtain such approvals\u037e and\nTravelCenters\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, to seek\nspecific performance to prevent breaches of the merger agreement by BP and/or Merger\nSubsidiary and to enforce the terms of the merger agreement.\nNegotiation Process and Procedural Fairness. The TravelCenters Board considered the enhancements\nthat TravelCenters and its advisors were able to obtain as a result of robust arm\u2019s-length negotiations\nwith BP, including the increase in the offer price proposed by BP from the time of its initial proposal to\nthe end of the negotiations and the ability of TravelCenters to terminate the merger agreement to\naccept a superior proposal, subject to certain conditions as more fully described in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fSuperior Proposal.\u201d\nOther Terms of the Merger Agreement. The TravelCenters Board considered other terms of the merger\nagreement, which are more fully described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u201d beginning\non page 59. Certain provisions of the merger agreement that the TravelCenters Board considered\nimportant included:\nAbility to Respond to Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals. At any time prior to obtaining the\nTravelCenters stockholder approval for the proposal to approve the merger, in the event that\nTravelCenters receives a written, bona fide, unsolicited acquisition proposal from any third party\nthat did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation of the merger agreement, and if\nthe TravelCenters Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors\nand outside legal counsel, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior\nproposal and the failure to take the following actions would reasonably be expected to be\ninconsistent with the duties of the TravelCenters Board under applicable law, the ability of\nTravelCenters and its acquisition representatives to:\nfurnish, pursuant to (but only pursuant to) an acceptable confidentiality agreement, non-\npublic information relating to TravelCenters or any of its Subsidiaries, to the third party, or\nits acquisition representatives\u037e and\nengage in negotiations or discussions with the third party and its acquisition\nrepresentatives.\nChange of Recommendation. Subject to certain notice obligations to BP and certain obligations to\ndiscuss and negotiate in good faith any revisions proposed by BP to the merger agreement in\n38 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nresponse to such notice, at any time prior to obtaining the TravelCenters stockholder approval\nfor the proposal to approve the merger, the TravelCenters Board may:\nmake an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the merger agreement)\u037e or\ncause TravelCenters to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to and in compliance\ntherewith in order to enter into a binding written definitive agreement providing for such\nsuperior proposal.\nMaterial Adverse Effect. The number and type of matters that are specifically excluded from being\nconsidered in determining whether a material adverse effect has or would reasonably be expected\nto occur.\nEnd Date. The end date under the merger agreement on which either party, subject to certain\nexceptions or extensions, can terminate the merger agreement allows for sufficient time to\nconsummate the merger, while minimizing the length of time during which TravelCenters would\nbe required to operate subject to the restrictions on interim operations set forth in the merger\nagreement.\nCooperation. Subject to the terms and conditions therein, the merger agreement requires BP to use\nits reasonable best efforts to consummate the merger and sets forth agreed actions with respect\nto BP\u2019s obligations to obtain requisite approvals to consummate the merger.\nStockholder Approval. Holders of at least a majority of outstanding shares of TravelCenters\u2019s\ncommon stock must vote in favor of a proposal to approve the merger.\nReverse Termination Fee. BP will be required to pay a reverse termination fee to TravelCenters of\n$90.9 million if TravelCenters or BP terminate the merger agreement if:\nthe end date and any applicable extension has passed\u037e or\nany Restraint (as defined herein) (solely in respect of antitrust laws) is in effect permanently\nenjoining or otherwise permanently prohibiting the consummation of the merger and such\nRestraint becomes final and nonappealable and, in either case, as of the time of such\ntermination, either the conditions precedent with respect to (i) Restraints (solely in respect\nof antitrust laws) or (ii) the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods or\napproval under applicable antitrust laws remain the only conditions precedent that have not\nbeen satisfied or waived (or in the case of those conditions that by their own terms are to be\nsatisfied at the closing of the merger, such conditions are capable of being satisfied if the\nclosing of the merger were to occur on the date of termination).\nAntitrust Efforts. The fact that TravelCenters and BP agreed to use reasonable best efforts to\nconsummate the merger and to comply with requests under any applicable antitrust law and\ncooperate with each other in connection with any required filings. Further, BP agreed to take any\nand all action necessary, including Divestiture Actions (as further described in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fEfforts to Close the Merger\u202f-\u202fAntitrust Filings and Related\nActions\u201d), to receive the necessary antitrust approval, subject to certain limitations and\nconditions as further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fEfforts to Close\nthe Merger\u202f-\u202fAntitrust Filings and Related Actions\u201d.\nLeases. The consent of SVC is necessary to effectuate the transaction and to amend various\nleases and guarantees to which a subsidiary of TravelCenters is a party. The TravelCenters\nBoard understands that creditworthiness was paramount to SVC in agreeing to new\ncounterparties to these leases and guarantees. SVC found BP Corporation North America Inc.\u2019s\nA3 / A- credit rating acceptable in this respect and, in connection with negotiating a continuing\nminimum investment grade credit rating of at least BBB- or Baa3 or a minimum net worth\nrequirement of $15 billion for any replacement guarantor not affiliated with BP p.l.c, was willing to\nsign the Consent and Amendment Agreement and recognize BP Corporation North America Inc.\nas an acceptable guarantor.\nThe TravelCenters Board also considered a variety of potentially negative reasons in its deliberations\nconcerning the merger agreement and the merger, including the following (not included in any relative\norder of importance):\n39 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNo Ongoing Equity Interest in TravelCenters. The merger would preclude TravelCenters\u2019s\nstockholders from participating in the future performance of TravelCenters\u2019s assets and any\npotential future appreciation of the value of shares of TravelCenters common stock.\nInability to Solicit Other Takeover Proposals. The merger agreement includes a covenant prohibiting\nTravelCenters and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers or directors and certain\nrepresentatives (as further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fNo\nSolicitation\u201d) from directly or indirectly soliciting, initiating, proposing, knowingly facilitating,\nknowingly inducing or knowingly encouraging the submission or announcement of any\nacquisition proposals. The TravelCenters Board also considered the fact that the right afforded\nto BP under the merger agreement to re-negotiate the merger agreement in light of acquisition\nproposals that the TravelCenters Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its\nfinancial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead\nto superior proposals may discourage other parties that might otherwise have an interest in a\nbusiness combination with, or an acquisition of, TravelCenters.\nTravelCenters Termination Fee. The TravelCenters Board considered the fact that TravelCenters\nmay be required to pay a termination fee of $51.9 million if the merger agreement is terminated\nunder certain circumstances, including if, prior to receiving the TravelCenters stockholder\napproval, the TravelCenters Board authorizes TravelCenters, pursuant to the terms of the merger\nagreement, to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal, and that the\namount of the termination fee is comparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size,\nwas reasonable, would not likely deter competing bids and would not likely be required to be\npaid unless TravelCenters entered into a more favorable transaction.\nEffect of Announcement. The TravelCenters Board considered the effect of the public\nannouncement of the transaction on TravelCenters\u2019s operations, including its relationships with\ncustomers, distributors, vendors and employees, as well as its ability to attract and retain key\nmanagement and other personnel while the proposed transaction is pending and the possibility\nof any suit, action or proceeding in respect of the merger agreement or the transactions\ncontemplated thereby.\nInterim Operating Covenants. The TravelCenters Board considered that the merger agreement\nimposes restrictions on the conduct of TravelCenters\u2019s business prior to the consummation of\nthe merger, requiring, amongst other things, TravelCenters to use its reasonable best efforts to\nconduct its business in the ordinary course, and that may limit TravelCenters from taking\nspecified actions, subject to specific limitations.\nRisks the Merger May Not Be Completed. The TravelCenters Board considered the fact that all\nconditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the merger may not be satisfied. The\nTravelCenters Board also considered the risks and costs to TravelCenters if the merger is not\nconsummated, including the diversion of management and employee attention, potential\nemployee attrition, the potential effect on vendors, distributors, customers, partners, licensees\nand others that do business with TravelCenters, the negative impact a failed transaction could\nhave on TravelCenters\u2019s commercial relationship with BP and, therefore, TravelCenters\u2019s future\nrevenues and the potential effect on the trading price of TravelCenters common stock.\nTransaction Costs. The TravelCenters Board considered the fact that significant costs are\ninvolved in connection with entering into and completing the merger (many of which are payable\nwhether or not the merger is consummated) and substantial time and effort of management is\nrequired to complete the merger, potentially resulting in disruptions to the operation of\nTravelCenters\u2019s business.\nPotential Conflicts of Interest. The TravelCenters Board considered the potential conflict of\ninterest created by the fact that certain of TravelCenters\u2019s executive officers and directors may\nhave financial interests in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the\nmerger, that may be different from or in addition to those of other TravelCenters stockholders, as\nmore fully described in the section entitled \u201c- Interests of Certain Directors and Executive\nOfficers of TravelCenters\u201d beginning on page 50.\n40",

        "Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.": {
            "text": "Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\nThe TravelCenters Board has engaged Citi as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. On\nFebruary 15, 2023, at a meeting of the TravelCenters Board to evaluate the merger, Citi delivered to the\nTravelCenters Board an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion dated\nFebruary 15, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of the written opinion and based on and subject to the\nassumptions made, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in the written opinion, the $86.00 in\ncash per outstanding common share to be received by the holders (other than (i) BP and its affiliates, or (ii)\nRMR or any entities managed by or that receive business management services from RMR, including SVC, or\nany of their respective affiliates) of outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the\nmerger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of Citi\u2019s written opinion, dated February 15, 2023, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, qualifications, limitations and other matters considered on the review undertaken by Citi in\nrendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by\nreference in its entirety. The summary of Citi\u2019s opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the\nfull text of the opinion. TravelCenters urges you to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Citi\u2019s opinion, the\nissuance of which was authorized by Citi\u2019s fairness opinion committee, was provided for the information of the\nTravelCenters Board (in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the proposed merger and was limited to the fairness,\nfrom a financial point of view, as of the date of the written opinion, of the $86.00 in cash per outstanding common share\nto be received by the holders (other than (i) BP and its affiliates, or (ii) RMR or any entities managed by or that receive\nbusiness management services from RMR, including SVC,or any of their respective affiliates) of outstanding shares\nof TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Citi\u2019s opinion does not address any other aspects\nor implications of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to\nany shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the proposed merger. Citi\u2019s\nopinion does not address TravelCenters\u2019s underlying business decision to effect the merger, the relative merits of the\nmerger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for TravelCenters or the effect of any other\ntransaction in which TravelCenters might engage. The following is a summary of Citi\u2019s opinion.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Citi, among other things:\nreviewed a draft, dated February 15, 2023, of the merger agreement\u037e\nheld discussions with certain of TravelCenters\u2019s senior officers, directors and other representatives\nand advisors concerning TravelCenters\u2019s business, operations and prospects\u037e\nexamined certain publicly available business and financial information relating to TravelCenters\u037e\n41 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexamined certain financial forecasts and other information and data relating to TravelCenters which\nwere provided to or discussed with Citi by TravelCenters management, which are referred to as the\n\u201cManagement Forecast\u201d, as summarized in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fCertain Financial\nForecasts\u201d)\u037e\nreviewed the financial terms of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement in relation to, among\nother things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes of TravelCenters\u2019s stock,\nTravelCenters\u2019s historical and projected earnings and other operating data and TravelCenters\u2019s\ncapitalization and financial condition\u037e\nconsidered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other transactions which Citi\nconsidered relevant in evaluating the merger\u037e\nanalyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the\nbusinesses of other companies whose operations Citi considered relevant in evaluating those of\nTravelCenters\u037e and\nconducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and\nfinancial, economic and market criteria as Citi deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.\nIn connection with Citi\u2019s engagement, at the direction of TravelCenters, and with the approval of SVC,\nTravelCenters\u2019s landlord for a substantial number of TravelCenters\u2019s properties pursuant to the SVC Leases,\nwhich leases provide that TravelCenters\u2019 rights and benefits under those agreements may be terminated in\nthe event that TravelCenters experiences a change in control, as defined in the SVC Leases, Citi was\nrequested to approach, and held discussions with, selected third parties to solicit indications of interest in\nTravelCenters\u2019s possible acquisition.\nIn rendering its opinion, Citi assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy\nand completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or\notherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citi and upon the assurances of TravelCenters management that\nthey were not aware of any relevant information that was omitted or that remained undisclosed to Citi. With\nrespect to the Management Forecast and other information and data relating to TravelCenters provided to or\notherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citi, Citi was advised by TravelCenters management that the\nManagement Forecast was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments of TravelCenters management as to TravelCenters\u2019s future financial performance. Citi also\nassumed, with TravelCenters\u2019s consent, that the financial results reflected in the Management Forecast and\nother information and data will be realized in the amounts and at the times projected.\nCiti also assumed, with TravelCenters\u2019s consent, that the merger will be consummated in accordance\nwith its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and\nthat, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third-party approvals, consents and releases for\nthe merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on\nTravelCenters or the merger. TravelCenters\u2019s representatives advised Citi, and Citi has further assumed, that\nthe final terms of the merger agreement would not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed\nby Citi. Citi did not make, and was not provided with, an independent evaluation or appraisal of\nTravelCenters\u2019s assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and Citi did not make any physical inspection\nof TravelCenters\u2019s properties or assets. Citi\u2019s opinion did not address the underlying business decisions of\nTravelCenters to effect the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business\nstrategies that might exist for TravelCenters or the effect of any other transaction in which TravelCenters\nmight engage. Citi also expressed no view as to, and Citi\u2019s opinion did not address, (a) the fairness (financial\nor otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officers, directors or\nemployees of any parties to the merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or\n(b) the fairness (financial or otherwise) of any transaction undertaken in connection with the merger,\nincluding (i) any termination of any business management agreement between TravelCenters or one or more\nof TravelCenters\u2019s affiliates, on the one hand, and RMR or one or more of its affiliates, on the other hand, (ii)\nthe sale of certain rights, title and interests in and to trademarks and intellectual property related to\nTravelCenters by SVC to TravelCenters, or (iii) any amendment to any lease, including any of the SVC\nLeases, purchase of any intellectual property assets or any other commercial agreement entered\n42 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\ninto in connection with the merger. Citi\u2019s opinion was necessarily based upon information available to it, and\nfinancial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing, as of the date of its written opinion.\nAlthough subsequent developments could have affected Citi\u2019s opinion had they taken place prior to the date\nof its written opinion, Citi has no obligation to update, revise or affirm its opinion.\nFor a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Citi to TravelCenters Board in connection\nwith the delivery of Citi\u2019s opinion, see the section entitled \u201c- Summary of Material Financial Analyses\u201d\nbeginning on page 42.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Citi to the TravelCenters\nBoard in connection with rendering its opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not\npurport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Citi, nor does the order of\nanalyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Citi. Some of the\nsummaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read\ntogether with the full text of each summary and are, alone, not a complete description of the financial\nanalyses of Citi. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is\nbased on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 15, 2023, and is not\nnecessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nThe preparation of financial opinions is a complex process involving various determinations as to the\nmost appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the\nparticular circumstances and, therefore, financial opinions are not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis\nor summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth below, without\nconsidering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Citi\u2019s\nfinancial opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Citi considered the results of all of its analyses and\ndid not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Citi made its\ndetermination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and experience after considering the\nresults of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the following analyses as a comparison is\ndirectly comparable to TravelCenters or the merger.\nCiti prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the TravelCenters Board as to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than (i) BP and its affiliates, or (ii) RMR or any\nentities managed by or that receive business management services from RMR, including SVC, or any of their\nrespective affiliates) of outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock, as of the date of the written\nopinion, of the $86.00 in cash per share to be received by such holders pursuant to the merger agreement.\nThese analyses do not purport to be appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which\nbusinesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based\nupon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of\nTravelCenters, Citi, or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from\nthose forecasts.\nThe merger consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between TravelCenters\nand BP, rather than by Citi, and was approved by the TravelCenters Board. Citi provided advice to\nTravelCenters during these negotiations. Citi did not, however, recommend any specific amount of\nconsideration to TravelCenters or the TravelCenters Board or that any specific amount of consideration\nconstituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.\nAs described above, the opinion of Citi to the TravelCenters Board was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the TravelCenters Board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The\nfollowing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Citi in\nconnection with its opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Citi\u2019s written opinion attached as\nAnnex B.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nCiti conducted a discounted cash flow analysis of TravelCenters using the Management Forecast.\nBased on the Management Forecast, Citi calculated the estimated present value of unlevered free cash flows\n43 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat TravelCenters was forecasted to generate during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023 through\nDecember 31, 2027 and both before and after taking into account the present value (as of December 31, 2022)\nof cash tax savings resulting from net operating loss, referred to as \u201cNOL\u201d, carryforwards and U.S. federal\ntax credits expected by TravelCenters management to be utilized during the forecast period. Stock-based\ncompensation was treated as a cash expense for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis. Citi also\nderived implied terminal values for TravelCenters by applying an illustrative range of perpetuity growth rates\nof (1.0)% to 1.0%, which range was selected by Citi based on its professional judgment and experience, to\nestimates of the unlevered free cash flows that TravelCenters was expected to generate in the terminal year,\nwhich such terminal year used EBITDA calculated assuming the average EBITDA margin in the period\nbeginning with the actual fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 and ending with the forecasted fiscal year\nending December 31, 2027 applied to forecasted total revenue for forecasted fiscal year ending December 31,\n2027, as advised by TravelCenters Management as a long-term assumption for such EBITDA margin. The\nunlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values reflecting\nimplied enterprise values for Travelcenters, as of December 31, 2022, using mid-year convention and\ndiscount rates ranging from 12.3% to 13.9%, reflecting estimates of TravelCenters\u2019s weighted average cost of\ncapital selected by Citi utilizing its professional judgment and experience, and calculated using a weighted-\naverage of the estimated cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt, assuming a range of target capital\nstructures of TravelCenters. From the range of implied enterprise values it derived for TravelCenters, Citi\nsubtracted TravelCenters\u2019s net debt as of December 31, 2022 (calculated as total debt, less cash and cash\nequivalents) to derive an equity value for TravelCenters and subsequently divided such equity value by\nTravelCenters\u2019s fully-diluted number of outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock, resulting in an\nimplied share price.\nFor purposes of its analysis, Citi separately valued, as of December 31, 2022, TravelCenters\u2019s (i) U.S.\nfederal NOL carryforwards, and (ii) U.S. federal tax credits, in each case, using estimates of tax cash savings\nresulting from (i) and (ii) as provided by TravelCenters management for the fiscal years ending December 31,\n2023 to December 31, 2027 and taking into account a U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21%, as provided by\nTravelCenters management, and using a perpetual tax credit utilization range for the forecast period of $0\nmillion to $1 million. All tax cash savings were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022\nutilizing discount rates ranging from 12.3% to 13.9%, reflecting Citi estimates of TravelCenters\u2019s weighted\naverage cost of capital and subsequently divided by TravelCenters\u2019s fully-diluted number of outstanding\nshares of TravelCenters common stock, resulting in an implied share price range for the value of such cash\ntax savings.\nThis analysis indicated implied per share equity value reference ranges of $72.90 to $98.71 per share of\nTravelCenters common stock without cash tax savings and $76.74 to $102.91 per share of TravelCenters\ncommon stock with cash tax savings, which Citi compared to the merger consideration.\nSelected Public Companies Analysis\nCiti performed a selected public companies analysis, which is an analysis designed to estimate an\nimplied value of a company through an analysis of the public valuation and trading multiples of similar\npublicly-traded companies. Citi reviewed financial and stock information of TravelCenters and the selected\npublicly-traded companies described below, referred to as the \u201cselected companies\u201d, which are divided into\ntwo separate categories: convenience stores, referred to as \u201cC-Stores\u201d, and traditional grocery stores,\nreferred to as \u201cTraditional Grocery\u201d. No publicly-traded company is identical to TravelCenters, but the\ncompanies listed were selected because, among other reasons, they possessed certain financial, operational\nor business characteristics that, in Citi\u2019s view, based on its professional judgment and experience, were\nsufficiently comparable to those of TravelCenters or otherwise relevant for purposes of comparison.\nCiti selected the following C-Stores companies:\nAlimentation Couche-Tard\nCasey\u2019s General Stores\nMurphy USA\nCiti selected the following Traditional Grocery companies:\n44 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nKroger\nRoyal Ahold Delhaize\nAlbertsons Companies\nWeis Markets\nIngles Markets\nCiti calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios based on financial and trading data\nas of February 15, 2023, information it obtained from TravelCenters management, with respect to\nTravelCenters only, and Wall Street research, public filings and FactSet Research Systems, with respect to\nTravelCenters and the selected companies. With respect to TravelCenters and the selected companies, Citi\ncalculated multiples of next twelve months, referred to as \u201cNTM\u201d, enterprise value to EBITDA, referred to as\n\u201cNTM EV/EBITDA\u201d based on daily observations of the share prices (and using such observed share prices\nto derive implied enterprise values) as well as the respective NTM EBITDA forecasts of TravelCenters and\nthe selected companies, over certain time periods ending February 15, 2023, whereby the multiples for the C-\nStores and the Traditional Grocery companies were aggregated by their respective peer group, resulting in\n25  and 75  percentile of the NTM EV/EBITDA ranges based on the daily observations referenced above for\nthe five-year period ending February 15, 2023 for the C-Stores companies of 9.6x to 10.2x, and for the\nTraditional Grocery companies of 5.2x to 6.1x.\nUtilizing these 25  to 75  percentile ranges for the C-Stores and the Traditional Grocery companies, Citi\nthen subtracted the mean relative discount of TravelCenters\u2019s observed NTM EV/EBITDA multiple over the\nfive-year period ending February 15, 2023 to the respective mean NTM EV/EBITDA multiple for the C-Stores\nof 6.4x and Traditional Grocery companies of 2.1x over that same time period from the respective 25  to 75\npercentile peer multiple ranges, resulting in an applied multiple range of 3.2x to 3.8x based on C-Stores\ncompanies and 3.1x to 3.9x for the Traditional Grocery companies. Those applied multiple ranges for C-Stores\nand Traditional Grocery companies were then multiplied by TravelCenters\u2019s forecasted EBITDA for fiscal\nyear ending December 31, 2023, based on the Management Forecast, resulting in the implied enterprise\nvalues for TravelCenters. Citi then deducted TravelCenters\u2019s net debt from such implied enterprise values to\ncalculate implied equity values and divided such implied equity values by the fully-diluted number of\noutstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock, resulting in the implied share price.\nThe results of this analysis indicated an implied share range of $62.65 to $76.55 based on the applied\ntrading multiple range of C-Store companies, and an implied share price range of $60.06 to $78.24 based on\nthe applied trading multiple range of the Traditional Grocery companies, which Citi compared to the merger\nconsideration.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis\nCiti performed a selected transactions analysis for the Traditional Grocery companies, which is an\nanalysis designed to estimate an implied illustrative value of a company through an analysis of the multiples\npaid in acquisitions of similar companies and businesses. Citi reviewed certain publicly available information\nfor selected transactions in the Traditional Grocery industry announced between 2019 and 2022, referred to\ncollectively as the \u201cTraditional Grocery selected transactions\u201d.\nAlthough none of the target companies in the Traditional Grocery selected transactions are directly\ncomparable to TravelCenters and none of the Traditional Grocery selected transactions are directly\ncomparable to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Traditional Grocery selected\ntransactions were chosen because they involved grocery stores with financial, operational or business\ncharacteristics that, in Citi\u2019s view, based on its professional judgment and experience, made them sufficiently\ncomparable to TravelCenters and/or the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement or otherwise\nrelevant for purposes of analysis. For each of the Traditional Grocery selected transactions, Citi reviewed the\nenterprise value of the selected transaction as a multiple of the relevant target company\u2019s last twelve months\nEBITDA, referred to as \u201cLTM EBITDA\u201d, as of the time of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to\nthe close of the transaction.

Financial data of the selected transactions were based on public\nfilings and other information including FactSet Research Systems. Financial data of TravelCenters was based\non financial information provided by, and used by Citi at the direction of, TravelCenters management. Citi\nthen applied the 3.7x to 6.0x range of enterprise value multiples of LTM EBITDA to TravelCenters\u2019s\nforecasted EBITDA for fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 based on the Management Forecast, which Citi\ndetermined, based on professional judgment and experience, was more representative of a normalized\nprofitability for TravelCenters than TravelCenters\u2019s LTM EBITDA, to derive a range of implied enterprise\nvalues for TravelCenters. Citi then deducted TravelCenters\u2019s net debt from such implied enterprise value to\ncalculate an implied equity value and divided such implied equity value by the fully-diluted number of\noutstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock, resulting in the implied share price.\nThe results of this analysis are below, which indicated an implied share price range of $73.57 to $124.01,\nwhich Citi compared to the merger consideration.\nCertain Additional Information\nCiti also observed certain additional factors regarding TravelCenters that were not considered part of\nCiti\u2019s financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including\nthe following:\nperformed a selected transaction analysis for the C-Store companies for selected transactions in the\nC-Store industry announced between 2018 and 2022, which indicated a low and high range of\nenterprise value of the C-Store selected transactions as a multiple of the relevant target company\u2019s\nLTM EBITDA as of the time of the most recently completed quarter prior to the close of the respective\ntransaction of 7.1x to 13.7x, which further indicated an implied share price range of $148.12 to $294.33\nbased on the application of the 7.1x to 13.7x to TravelCenters\u2019s forecasted EBITDA for fiscal year\nending December 31, 2023\u037e\nperformed an analysis of all-cash consideration acquisition transactions announced during the time\nperiod from January 1, 2018 through February 15, 2023 involving a U.S. public company as the target\nwhere the disclosed enterprise values for such transactions were between $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion,\nwhich indicated a 25  and 75  percentile premiums of the price paid in these transactions relative to\nthe target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to the announcement of the transaction of\n19.6% and 69.2%, respectively, which further indicated an implied share price range of $59.15 to $83.65\nbased on the application of the 25  and 75  percentile premiums to the closing price per share of\nTravelCenters common stock of $49.44 as of February 15, 2023\u037e and\npublicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019 price targets for TravelCenters, which indicated\nstandalone price targets of $60.00 to $85.00 per share of TravelCenters common stock.\nMiscellaneous\nPursuant to an engagement letter between TravelCenters and Citi, TravelCenters has agreed to pay Citi\nan aggregate fee of approximately $20 million, $2 million of which became payable upon Citi\u2019s delivery of the\nopinion described in this section and the remainder of which is contingent upon the closing of the merger.\nTravelCenters also has agreed to reimburse Citi, subject to certain conditions, for reasonable expenses\nincurred by Citi in performing its services, and to indemnify Citi and related persons against certain liabilities\narising out of its engagement.\n46 \nth\nth\nth\nth",

The Management Forecast was generated solely for internal use and not\ndeveloped with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines\nestablished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of\nprospective financial data or published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-looking statements or U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Management Forecast is a forward-looking\nstatement. The Management Forecast summarized in this section was prepared by TravelCenters\u2019s\nmanagement.\nThe Management Forecast contains non-GAAP financial measures, including Total Site Level Operating\nExpense (excl. Real Estate Rent Expense), 4-Wall EBITDAR, 4-Wall EBITDA, Total Corp. Level operating\nexpense (excl. depreciation and amortization), EBITDA, EBIT and Pre-Tax Book Income. TravelCenters\u2019s\nmanagement included such measures in the Management Forecast because it believed that such measures\nmay be useful in evaluating, on a prospective basis, the potential operating performance and cash flow of\nTravelCenters. TravelCenters\u2019s management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful for\ninvestors, taken in conjunction with TravelCenters\u2019s GAAP financial statements, because they provide\ngreater transparency and period-over-period comparability with respect to TravelCenters\u2019s operating\nperformance and can enhance investors\u2019 ability to identify operating trends in TravelCenters\u2019s business.\nTravelCenters\u2019s management uses these measures, among other factors, to assess and analyze operational\nresults and trends and to make financial and operational decisions. A material limitation associated with the\nuse of the above non-GAAP financial measures is that they have no standardized measurement prescribed\nby GAAP and may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nDue to the forward-looking nature of the Management Forecast, specific quantification of the amounts that\nwould be required to reconcile the Management Forecast to GAAP measures are not available. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information\npresented in accordance with GAAP. None of Total Site Level Operating Expense (excl. Real Estate Rent\nExpense), 4-Wall EBITDAR, 4-Wall EBITDA, Total Corp. Level operating expense (excl. depreciation and\namortization), EBITDA, EBIT and Pre-Tax Book Income should be considered as an alternative to total\nrevenue, income from operations or net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance.\nNo independent registered public accounting firm has examined, compiled or otherwise performed any\nprocedures with respect to the Management Forecast or expressed any opinion or given any other form of\nassurance with respect thereto, and no independent registered public accounting firm assumes any\nresponsibility for the information contained in the Management Forecast.\nNeither TravelCenters nor any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives has made\nor makes any representation to any security holder regarding the information included in the Management\nForecast or the ultimate performance of TravelCenters, BP, the surviving corporation or any of their affiliates\n49 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\ncompared to the information contained in the Management Forecast. TravelCenters has made no\nrepresentation to BP or Merger Subsidiary, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the\nManagement Forecast.\nThe assumptions and estimates underlying the Management Forecast, all of which are difficult to\npredict and many of which are beyond the control of TravelCenters, may not be realized as forecasted.\nActual results may differ materially from those reflected in the Management Forecast. In addition, the\nManagement Forecast will be affected by TravelCenters\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and\ntargets over the applicable period.\nTravelCenters\u2019s actual future financial results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by\nthe Management Forecast due to numerous factors, including many that are beyond TravelCenters\u2019s ability\nto control or predict. While presented with numerical specificity, the Management Forecast necessarily is\nbased on numerous assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of TravelCenters and difficult to\npredict. Important factors that may affect actual results and result in the Management Forecast not being\nachieved include, but are not limited to, the effect that customer demand, inflationary or recessionary\npressures on product, labor and operating costs, general economic conditions, geopolitical risks, competitive\nconditions in our businesses, fuel market dynamics, war and other hostilities, supply chain challenges and\ngovernment regulation, among other factors, may negatively impact profitability, the successful integration\nof acquired, developed or franchised locations into the network, the realization of expected benefits from\ncapital expenditures and other investments, the impact that continued improved fuel efficiency of motor\nvehicle engines and other fuel conservation and alternative fuel practices could have on fuel volumes or\nprofitability, the effect that adverse weather events, natural disasters and climate change may have on\nproperties, operations or financial condition and other risk factors described in TravelCenters\u2019s SEC filings,\nincluding TravelCenters\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and described\nunder the section below entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d. The\nManagement Forecast also reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions, industry conditions and\neconomic factors that are subject to change. The information set forth in the Management Forecast is not\nfact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results.\nThe Management Forecast was developed for TravelCenters based on TravelCenters\u2019s continued\noperation as a standalone, publicly traded company without giving effect to the merger, and therefore the\nManagement Forecast does not give effect to the merger or any changes to TravelCenters\u2019s operations or\nstrategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the merger, including potential cost synergies\nto be realized as a result of the merger, or to any costs incurred in connection with the merger. Furthermore,\nthe Management Forecast does not take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be completed\nand should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe Management Forecast summarized in this section was prepared prior to the execution of the merger\nagreement and has not been updated to reflect any changes after the date they were prepared. TravelCenters\nwill not update or otherwise revise the Management Forecast hereafter to reflect circumstances arising after\ntheir preparation.\nIn light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Forecast, readers of\nthis proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Management Forecast.",

TravelCenters restricted shares will be treated\nlike all other shares of common stock outstanding at the time of the merger, as described under \u201c- Certain\nEffects of the Merger on TravelCenters\u201d above. Payments in respect of TravelCenters equity awards will be\nreduced by applicable tax withholding.\nThe following table sets forth the number of TravelCenters restricted shares that are unvested and the\ncash amounts (on a pre-tax basis) that each TravelCenters executive officer is expected to receive in respect\nthereof. The amounts listed in the table below are based on the number of unvested TravelCenters restricted\nshares as of March 23, 2023 the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this\nproxy statement, and exclude any additional grants that may be made, following such date, and assume a per\nshare merger consideration of $86.00. Depending on when the merger occurs, certain TravelCenters restricted\nshares that are now unvested and included in the table below may vest or be forfeited in accordance with\ntheir terms, independent of the merger.\nName\nUnvested \nTravelCenters \nRestricted\nShares \n(#)\nMerger Consideration \nPayable \nfor Unvested\nTravelCenters \nRestricted Shares \n($)\nJonathan M.

These amounts will be paid, if at all, in a lump sum no more than sixty days following the\nclosing date of the merger, with the actual amount of the pro-rated portion of the Annual Bonus dependent\non when the closing date of the merger occurs.\nFor further information with respect to the arrangements between TravelCenters and its executive\nofficers, including a quantification of amounts payable under the Executive Agreements, see \u201cProposal 2:\nAdvisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements\u201d beginning on page\n86.\nBenefit Arrangements\nAs described under \u201cEmployee Matters,\u201d the merger agreement requires BP or the surviving corporation\nto provide certain commitments regarding the value of compensation and benefits for twelve months\nfollowing the Effective Time to employees of TravelCenters or any of its Subsidiaries who remain employed\nfollowing the merger, including TravelCenters\u2019s executive officers.\nIndemnification, Exculpation and Insurance of Directors and Executive Officers\nAs described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fIndemnification, Exculpation and Insurance of Directors\nand Executive Officers,\u201d during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth\nanniversary of the Effective Time, the surviving corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and BP will cause the\nsurviving corporation and its Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold harmless all Indemnified Persons (as\ndefined below), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law in the event of any threatened or actual\n52 \n(2)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nclaim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (a \u201cClaim\u201d), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in\nwhole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified\nPerson is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board committee) or officer of\nTravelCenters, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors and (ii) any action or omission\n(including the approval of the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby), or alleged\naction or omission, occurring at or prior to the closing of the merger, in such Indemnified Person\u2019s capacity\nas a director or officer of TravelCenters, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors,\nagainst any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and\nexpenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each\nIndemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law upon receipt of any undertaking required\nby applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such\nthreatened or actual Claim\u037e provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced will provide an\nundertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to\nindemnification. Neither BP nor the surviving corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of\nany judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification is being sought by an Indemnified\nPerson pursuant to the merger agreement, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an\nunconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim or such\nIndemnified Person otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (such consent\nnot to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). BP and the surviving corporation will cooperate\nwith an Indemnified Person in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Person could seek\nindemnification pursuant to the merger agreement.\nAt or prior to the Effective Time, TravelCenters will, or if TravelCenters is unable, BP will, or will cause\nan affiliate or the surviving corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the\nnon-cancelable extension of the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability coverage of TravelCenters\u2019s existing\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies and TravelCenters\u2019s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies,\nin each case for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim in\nrespect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including claims with respect to the\napproval of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby) with\nterms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided\nunder TravelCenters\u2019s existing policies for the Indemnified Persons\u037e provided that, in the event that\nTravelCenters takes the foregoing actions, TravelCenters will, if appropriate, give BP a reasonable\nopportunity to review such \u201ctail\u201d insurance policy and TravelCenters will give good-faith consideration to\nany comments made by BP with respect thereto\u037e and provided, further, that the aggregate cost for such \u201ctail\u201d\ninsurance policy will not exceed 300% of the amount TravelCenters paid in its last full fiscal year (such\nmaximum amount, the \u201cMaximum Tail Premium\u201d) and if the cost for such \u201ctail\u201d insurance policy exceeds the\nMaximum Tail Premium, then TravelCenters will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost\nnot exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.\nIf BP or the surviving corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and will not be\nthe continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys\nany of its property and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so\nthat the applicable successor, assign or transferee will assume these obligations.\nThese rights will survive consummation of the merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and will be\nenforceable by, each Indemnified Person. These obligations of BP and the surviving corporation will not be\nterminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person without\nthe consent of such Indemnified Person.",

This discussion is based upon the Code, U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code,\ncourt decisions, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), and other\napplicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to\nchange or differing interpretations, at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or\ndiffering interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this\ndiscussion.\nThis discussion is limited to holders that hold their shares of TravelCenters common stock as \u201ccapital\nassets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). This\nsummary does not describe any of the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign\ntax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g.,\nstate, gift or alternative minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax). In addition, this\ndiscussion does not address any considerations in respect of any withholding required pursuant to the\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder\nand intergovernmental agreements entered into in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or\npractices adopted in connection with any such agreement). For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cholder\u201d\nmeans either a U.S. holder or a Non-U.S. holder (each as defined below) or both, as the context may require.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address nor does it purport to be\na complete analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular\nholders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, or to holders subject to special rules under the\nU.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example, but not limited to:\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\nmutual funds\u037e\ninsurance companies\u037e\nbrokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities\u037e\ndealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to\nshares of common stock (by vote or value)\u037e\nregulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts\u037e\nretirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts\u037e\ntax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental\norganizations and pension funds\u037e\nholders that are holding shares of common stock as part of a \u201cstraddle,\u201d hedge, constructive sale, or\nother integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions\u037e\nU.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\npartnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, \u201cS\ncorporations,\u201d or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in\nsuch entities)\u037e\n54 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexpatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code\u037e\nholders that are required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such\nincome being recognized on an \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d\u037e\npersons subject to the alternative minimum tax\u037e\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\ngrantor trusts\u037e\ncontrolled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that\naccumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax\u037e\nholders that received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax\nqualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants\u037e\nholders that own a direct or indirect equity interest in parent following the merger\u037e and\nholders that hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch\nthereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of TravelCenters common stock, the U.S. federal\nincome tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner,\nthe activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partnership level.\nPartnerships holding the shares of TravelCenters common stock and partners therein should consult their tax\nadvisors regarding the consequences of the merger.\nWe have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements\nmade and the conclusions reached in the following summary. No assurance can be given that the IRS will\nagree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in\nthe event of litigation.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY\nPARTICULAR TRAVELCENTERS STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR\nTAX CIRCUMSTANCES.

For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial\nowner of shares of TravelCenters common stock who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States, or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\na trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the\nadministration of such trust and one (1) or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d  (within the meaning of the\nCode) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust validly\nelected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to\nthe merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. holder will\nrecognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash\nreceived (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding or transfer taxes) and the U.S.\n55 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHolder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. A U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for the shares. A U.S. holder\u2019s\ngain or loss generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if\nsuch U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the\nmerger. A preferential tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate\nU.S. holder. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses. A U.S. holder that holds different\nblocks of common stock (shares of common stock purchased or acquired on different dates or at different\nprices) should consult their tax advisor to determine how the above rules apply to them.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nThis section applies to \u201cNon-U.S. holders\u201d. For purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cNon-U.S. holder\u201d\nmeans a beneficial owner of shares of TravelCenters common stock who or that is not a U.S. holder (and\nexcludes an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes).\nSubject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject\nto U.S. federal income or withholding tax in respect of gain recognized in connection with the merger, unless:\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. holder in the United\nStates (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. holder in the United States), in which case\nsuch gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S.\npersons, and, if the Non-U.S. holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch\nprofits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\nsuch Non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such\ngain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable\nincome tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such Non-U.S.\nholder\u037e or\nshares of TravelCenters common stock constitute a United States real property interest (a \u201cUSRPI\u201d)\nby reason of the Company\u2019s status as a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such\nterm is defined in the Code (a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d) at any time within the shorter of the five-year period\npreceding the merger and such Non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable\nTravelCenters common stock (the \u201crelevant period\u201d), and, if TravelCenters common stock is regularly\ntraded on an established securities market (within the meaning of the Code), such Non-U.S. holder\nowns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than 5% of outstanding\nTravelCenters common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the\nfirst bullet above, except that the branch profits tax will not apply). Generally, a corporation is a\nUSRPHC if the fair market value of its USRPIs equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market\nvalue of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or\nbusiness. For this purpose, USRPIs generally include land, improvements and associated personal\nproperty. There can be no assurances that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time\nduring the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their\nown tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S.\nholders and Non-U.S. holders in connection with the merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a\nU.S. holder pursuant to the merger, unless the U.S. holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a\nproperly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. holder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification\nnumber and certifying that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes\nan exemption, and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.

Any\nmaterial facts in TravelCenters\u2019s public reports previously filed with the SEC that are incorporated by\nreference into this proxy statement that contradict the factual disclosures about TravelCenters contained in\nthe representations and warranties in the merger agreement will modify such factual disclosures. The\nrepresentations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by TravelCenters, BP and Merger\nSubsidiary were made solely to the parties to, and solely for the purposes of, the merger agreement and as of\nspecific dates and were qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by TravelCenters, BP and\nMerger Subsidiary in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your\nreview of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this\nsummary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the\nprincipal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the\nright not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be\nuntrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the merger\nagreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject\nto a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports\nand documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by the matters contained in the company\ndisclosure schedule that TravelCenters provided to BP in connection with the merger agreement, which we\nrefer to as the disclosure schedule, which disclosures were not reflected in the merger agreement. Moreover,\ninformation concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the\ndate of the merger agreement. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or\nany description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts of TravelCenters, BP and Merger\nSubsidiary or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates.",

The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft dated February 15, 2023 of the Merger Agreement and\nheld discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of the\nCompany concerning the business, operations and prospects of the Company. We examined certain publicly\navailable business and financial information relating to the Company as well as certain financial forecasts\nand other information and data relating to the Company which were provided to or discussed with us by the\nmanagement of the Company.

As more fully described in the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Subsidiary will\nbe merged with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with the Company surviving the Merger, and (ii) each\noutstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the \u201cCompany Stock\u201d)\n(other than shares of the Company Stock held by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or held by any Subsidiary (as\ndefined in the Merger Agreement) of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary)) will be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive $86.00 in cash, without interest (the \u201cMerger\nConsideration\u201d). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft dated February 15, 2023 of the Merger Agreement and\nheld discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of the\nCompany concerning the business, operations and prospects of the Company. We examined certain publicly\navailable business and financial information relating to the Company as well as certain financial forecasts\nand other information and data relating to the Company which were provided to or discussed with us by the\nmanagement of the Company.
