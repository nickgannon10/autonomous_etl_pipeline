Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, Icahn has agreed,\namong other things, to vote all shares of Cloudera common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and against any competing\ntransaction so long as the Merger Agreement has not been terminated and the Board of Directors has not made a Company Board Recommendation\nChange. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u2014The Voting\nAgreement.\u201d\nQ: What happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not receive\nany payment for their shares of Cloudera common stock.

The vote with respect to the Compensation\nProposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Cloudera. Therefore, if the other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is\ncompleted, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Cloudera\u2019s named executive officers in accordance with\nthe terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\nQ: What do I need to do now?\nA: You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the\nMerger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other\nthings, the Merger and how it\n15\nTable of Contents\naffects you.

These forward-looking statements\nare based on Cloudera\u2019s current expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the proposed transaction and the potential\nbenefits thereof, its business and industry, management\u2019s beliefs and certain assumptions made by Cloudera, Parent and Merger Sub, all of which are\nsubject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition,\nand often contain words such as \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d\n\u201cpotentially,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey\nuncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of\nwhich are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the\nanticipated benefits thereof.

This\nmeans that holders of shares of Cloudera common stock who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and\nwho follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Cloudera common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount\ndetermined to be fair value, if any, (or in\n25Table of Contents\ncertain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights,\u201d on the difference\nbetween the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding).

Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal\nrights.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nEvents Leading Up to the Merger Agreement\nAs part of Cloudera\u2019s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of Directors and Cloudera\u2019s senior\nmanagement periodically review, consider and assess Cloudera\u2019s operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they\nmay affect those strategic goals and plans. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for business\ncombinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives.\nOn January 3, 2019, Cloudera completed its previously announced all-stock business combination transaction with Hortonworks, Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation (\u201cHortonworks\u201d). The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on that date was\n$10.37 per share.\nFrom time to time in 2019 following the closing of the business combination with Hortonworks, representatives of KKR and members of senior\nmanagement of Cloudera met to discuss the market generally and Cloudera\u2019s business and performance after the business combination with\nHortonworks. These interactions were based on longstanding relationships between members of senior management at Hortonworks and representatives\nof KKR.\nOn June 5, 2019, Cloudera announced fiscal first quarter 2020 results following the Cloudera-Hortonworks merger, reduced its full-year guidance for\n2020 and announced the resignation of its then current CEO.\nBased on Cloudera\u2019s performance post-merger, in early June 2019, following the review and approval of the Board of Directors, Cloudera engaged\nMorgan Stanley as its financial advisor in connection with a review of certain potential strategic alternatives, including a potential \u201cPIPE\u201d transaction and\nthe possible sale of Cloudera. The Board of Directors selected Morgan Stanley in connection with such strategic review based on its qualifications and\nits experience in the software industry, as well as its familiarity with Cloudera.\nOn June 13, 2019, Morgan Stanley, acting on behalf of Cloudera and at the direction of the Board of Directors, reached out to representatives of\nKKR and invited KKR to present to the Board of Directors regarding its views on potential strategic alternatives available to Cloudera, given KKR\u2019s\nfamiliarity with Cloudera\u2019s business.\nOn June 20, 2019, representatives of KKR gave an informational presentation to the Board of Directors describing the types of potential\ntransactions involving Cloudera that a financial sponsor might be interested in pursuing. No specific transaction was discussed and no proposal was\nmade by KKR at that time. Representatives of KKR also conveyed to the Board of Directors at that meeting that it may not be an ideal time for Cloudera\nto pursue a potential sale of Cloudera to a financial sponsor, based on the status of its business transition and ongoing integration of Hortonworks.\nBy August 1, 2019, the price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange had decreased to $6.35 per share as of the close\nof trading on that date.\nOn August 1, 2019, Carl C. Icahn and certain of his affiliates (collectively referred to as the \u201cIcahn Group\u201d) filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC\ndisclosing that collectively they beneficially owned approximately 12.62% of the then-outstanding shares of Cloudera common stock. As part of the\nSchedule 13D, the Icahn Group expressed its view that shares of Cloudera common stock were undervalued and indicated an intention to speak with\nrepresentatives of the Board of Directors and management to discuss enhancing stockholder value and potentially seeking board representation.\n31Table of Contents\nOn August 12, 2019, Cloudera entered into a voting and standstill agreement with the Icahn Group, pursuant to which, among other matters,\nCloudera agreed to appoint two new directors, Nicholas Graziano and Jesse Lynn, designated by the Icahn Group to the Board of Directors. Cloudera also\nagreed to add one of the new directors to each of the CEO Search Committee of the Board of Directors and the M&A Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe M&A Committee of the Board of Directors was a standing committee established by the Board of Directors for convenience to consider a broad array\nof potential strategic transactions and provide regular feedback and guidance to Cloudera\u2019s senior management regarding such potential transactions. At\nthe time of that agreement, the Icahn Group reported on Schedule 13D that it beneficially owned approximately 18% of Cloudera\u2019s then-outstanding\nshares of common stock.\nOn November 15, 2019, the M&A Committee which at the time was comprised of Peter Fenton, Paul Cormier and Nicholas Graziano, held a meeting\nvia videoconference, with representatives from Cloudera\u2019s senior management, Cloudera\u2019s outside legal counsel at Latham & Watkins LLP (\u201cLatham\u201d)\nand Morgan Stanley present, to discuss potential outreach to potentially interested bidders in connection with a possible sale of Cloudera. Following\ndiscussion of potential interested parties as well as the likelihood of potential interest based on Cloudera\u2019s performance during the prior six months, the\nM&A Committee instructed representatives of Cloudera\u2019s senior management, with assistance from Morgan Stanley, to begin limited outreach to certain\ncounterparties to gauge potential interest in the possible sale of Cloudera. The M&A Committee chose to conduct a targeted approach in its outreach\ndue to concerns related to confidentiality. The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on\nNovember 15, 2019 was $8.76 per share.\nDuring the course of December 2019 until early February 2020, representatives of Morgan Stanley, as instructed by the M&A Committee, contacted\nfour potential counterparties (comprised of one strategic counterparty and three private equity sponsors, including KKR) to solicit interest in a potential\nacquisition of Cloudera. Due to the complexity of Cloudera\u2019s technology transition and concerns around confidentiality, contacted parties were selected\nbased on their familiarity with Cloudera in order to understand the potential interest of the most advanced parties before determining how narrow or\nbroad to conduct their outreach. Each party executed a confidentiality agreement with Cloudera and attended a management presentation by Cloudera\u2019s\nsenior management. Each such confidentiality agreement included a customary standstill provision with a term of 12 months or less that expired upon the\nannouncement of a change of control transaction. During this outreach process, members of senior management of Cloudera and representatives from\nMorgan Stanley sent periodic updates to the M&A Committee regarding the status of discussions. However, due to general concerns regarding the\nstatus of Cloudera\u2019s business transition and integration of Hortonworks, none of the contacted parties expressed an interest in submitting a proposal for\nan acquisition of the Company at the time.\nOn January 12, 2020, the Board of Directors appointed Robert Bearden, a member of the Board of Directors, as the President and Chief Executive\nOfficer of Cloudera. The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on January 13, 2020 was\n$11.74 per share.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and Cloudera\u2019s stock price fell roughly in line with the\nimpact of COVID-19 on other market participants in the same industry. By March 18, 2020, the price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York\nStock Exchange had decreased to $5.30 per share as of the close of trading on that date.\nIn late March 2020 and into April 2020, representatives of a large US-based software-focused private equity firm (\u201cPE Firm A\u201d), which had not\npreviously been contacted during the previous outreach process in December to February 2020, approached Mr. Bearden on an unsolicited basis to\nexpress an interest in potentially acquiring Cloudera in a take-private transaction. During the course of these discussions with PE Firm A, members of\nsenior management of Cloudera and representatives from Morgan Stanley continued to provide periodic updates to the M&A Committee and the Board\nof Directors regarding the status of discussions with PE Firm A.\n32\nTable of Contents\nFollowing several substantive discussions and diligence meetings in late April and early May 2020, on May 12, 2020, PE Firm A submitted a non-\nbinding proposal to acquire Cloudera for $8.50 per share of Cloudera common stock. The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York\nStock Exchange as of the close of trading on May 12, 2020 was $8.33 per share.\nOn May 13, 2020, the Board of Directors held a special meeting by videoconference, with representatives from Cloudera\u2019s senior management,\nLatham and Morgan Stanley present, to discuss the proposal from PE Firm A. Following discussion and the presentation by Morgan Stanley of certain\npreliminary financial analyses, the Board of Directors determined that the proposal from PE Firm A was timed to take advantage of the short-term impacts\nof COVID-19, and did not represent sufficient value to Cloudera\u2019s stockholders and directed senior management, with the assistance of Morgan Stanley,\nto conduct outreach to potential acquirers to evaluate interest in a potential acquisition of Cloudera (including previously contacted parties). The Board\nof Directors also instructed Cloudera\u2019s senior management to prepare updated forecasts for use with potential bidders in connection with their evaluation\nof a potential acquisition of Cloudera.\nOn May 29, 2020, the Board of Directors held another special meeting by videoconference, with representatives from Cloudera\u2019s senior\nmanagement, Latham and Morgan Stanley present, and approved the May 2020 Forecasts for use in connection with outreach to potential acquirers. The\nMay 2020 Forecasts were provided to each of the contacted parties in May and June 2020, including CD&R and KKR.\nDuring the course of late May and early June 2020, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted each of the parties previously contacted\nregarding their potential interest in an acquisition of Cloudera and engaged with six additional private equity firms (including CD&R) and three additional\nstrategic parties in order to solicit potential interest in an acquisition of Cloudera. Each party who had previously not executed a confidentiality\nagreement entered into a confidentiality agreement with Cloudera, which included a customary standstill provision with a term of 12 months or less that\nexpired upon the announcement of a change of control transaction. Three of the newly contacted private equity firms (including CD&R) and two of the\nnewly contacted strategic parties each separately attended a management presentation with members of Cloudera\u2019s senior management team. In addition,\nCloudera\u2019s senior management team also had follow-up meetings with each of the parties previously contacted beginning in December 2019 regarding\ntheir potential interest in an acquisition of Cloudera (including KKR). However, none of the contacted parties decided to submit a proposal, again citing\nconcerns around the execution of Cloudera\u2019s business transition, the status of the Hortonworks integration process and valuation concerns as reflected\nin the then current stock price. However, representatives of CD&R expressed a desire to revisit discussions after another one or two fiscal quarters of\nadditional performance. In addition, by early June 2020, equity values in the United States had generally recovered from their COVID-19 pandemic lows,\nand on June 1, 2020, the price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $10.96 per share. As a result, PE Firm A and\nCloudera did not continue discussions regarding a potential transaction. In consultation with the M&A Committee and the Board of Directors, members\nof Cloudera\u2019s senior management decided to pause ongoing discussions regarding the possible sale of Cloudera, but agreed to stay in contact with\nparties regarding their potential interest.\nDuring the course of the following six months, Cloudera\u2019s business continued to perform better than analyst expectations, but its stock price\nremained largely flat (trading between approximately $10 and $13 per share on the New York Stock Exchange). Representatives of Cloudera\u2019s senior\nmanagement stayed in periodic contact with the parties previously engaged in discussions regarding the possible sale of Cloudera in order to monitor\npossible interest per prior discussions with the M&A Committee.\nIn November and December 2020, representatives of CD&R and Cloudera\u2019s senior management held meetings to provide CD&R with an update on\nCloudera\u2019s go-to-market and financial performance.\nIn December 2020, Cloudera\u2019s senior management prepared the December 2020 Board Plan. The Board of Directors reviewed and approved the\nDecember 2020 Board Plan on December 15, 2020, The December 2020 Board Plan was shared with representatives of CD&R on January 12, 2021 in\nconnection with their due diligence review of Cloudera.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOn January 27, 2021 representatives of CD&R contacted Mr. Bearden and proposed a $550 million investment in convertible preferred stock of\nCloudera with a dividend yield of 6.0% per year and a conversion price of $14.39, which represented a 20% premium to the 90-day volume weighted\naverage price of Cloudera common stock.\nOn February 2, 2021, Mr. Bearden, based on feedback from discussions with members of the Board of Directors and consideration of the dilutive\neffect and costs associated with the transaction, informed CD&R that Cloudera was not interested in pursuing the minority investment. However, the\nBoard of Directors indicated support for continuing discussions regarding a potential sale of the Company with CD&R\nIn the first calendar quarter of 2021, representatives of CD&R and Cloudera\u2019s senior management held several additional meetings to provide\nCD&R with an update on Cloudera\u2019s business, technology and financial performance.\nOn March 16, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives from Cloudera\u2019s senior management, Latham\nand Morgan Stanley present, and approved the March 2021 Board Plan, which updated the December 2020 Board Plan for actual results for the fiscal year\nended January 31, 2021.\nOn April 1, 2021, representatives of CD&R contacted Mr. Bearden to propose a potential diligence work plan in order to confirm CD&R\u2019s interest in\na potential acquisition of Cloudera. During the course of April, representatives of Cloudera and CD&R participated in several additional diligence\nmeetings to review high priority information requested by CD&R.\nThe March 2021 Board Plan was shared with representatives of CD&R on April 12, 2021 in connection with their due diligence review of Cloudera.\nAt the same time, members of Cloudera\u2019s senior management also provided to CD&R the Upside Scenario (which was intended to encourage CD&R to\nsubmit an attractive proposal).\nOn May 11, 2021, the M&A Committee held a meeting via videoconference with certain other directors, representatives of Cloudera senior\nmanagement, Latham and Morgan Stanley present. Mr. Bearden provided an update to the M&A Committee on the status of discussions with CD&R and\nthe various meetings held with CD&R. Following discussion, the M&A Committee instructed Mr. Bearden to continue discussions with CD&R, given the\nseriousness of their potential interest and prior discussions. The M&A Committee also considered additional outreach to potential bidders by Morgan\nStanley and Cloudera\u2019s senior management. However, given concerns about the negative impact of potential deal leaks and the belief that interest from\nother bidders was unlikely based on past outreach, the M&A Committee ultimately determined not to reach out to other bidders at that stage and instead\nto require a customary \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision if the parties ultimately reached a deal, which would allow Cloudera to solicit additional bids for a specified\nperiod of time following the signing of any definitive agreement with respect to a transaction, particularly given the familiarity that likely bidders already\nhad with Cloudera after the outreach to other potential bidders in 2019 and again in 2020.\nOn May 13, 2021, representatives of Cloudera senior management conducted two additional diligence meetings with representatives of CD&R on\nCloudera\u2019s bookings and cost structure.\nOn May 13, 2021, representatives of CD&R contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to convey an initial verbal non-binding indication of\ninterest to acquire Cloudera for cash based on a per share price of $14.50 per share of Cloudera common stock, with customary go-shop parameters to be\nnegotiated. The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on May 13, 2021 was $11.43 per\nshare. Morgan Stanley communicated to CD&R that they would convey the proposal to Cloudera, but that it would likely be considered too low by the\nBoard of Directors.\nLater in the day on May 13, 2021, representatives of CD&R contacted Morgan Stanley and increased their verbal proposal to $15.00 per share.\nCD&R\u2019s revised offer of $15.00 per share represented a 30% premium to the closing price of Cloudera\u2019s common stock on May 12.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOn May 14, 2021, the Board of Directors held a special meeting by videoconference, with representatives from Cloudera\u2019s senior management,\nLatham and Morgan Stanley present, to discuss the proposal from CD&R. Latham reviewed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Board of Directors certain preliminary financial analyses based on the proposal from CD&R.\nFollowing discussion, the Board of Directors determined that the proposal from CD&R did not represent adequate value and instructed Morgan Stanley\nto respond with a counter-proposal of $17.00 in cash per share of Cloudera common stock, with (1) a go-shop period of 45 days, (2) a termination fee\npayable by Cloudera of 1.25% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement to\nenter into a definitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal prior to the end of the go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of\n2.50% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement under certain other\ncircumstances and (4) no financing contingencies related to the transaction. At the meeting, the Board of Directors also requested that Morgan Stanley\nseek clarity from CD&R regarding the status of its equity commitments since the Board of Directors expected that it would likely be necessary for CD&R\nto bring in another financial sponsor to participate in the process.\nFollowing the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted representatives of CD&R to relay the counter-proposal as outlined by the\nBoard of Directors. Representatives of CD&R indicated that a price of $17.00 per share in cash would not be acceptable and that the go-shop terms would\nneed to be revised. The CD&R representatives further indicated that they would revert with another proposal, including with additional clarity on\nexpected equity financing sources.\nLater that same evening, representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, legal counsel to CD&R (\u201cKirkland\u201d), contacted representatives of Latham in order\nto discuss preliminary transaction matters.\nOn May 15, 2021, representatives of KKR contacted Mr. Bearden to express an interest in joining a transaction with CD&R to acquire Cloudera and\nprovide the remaining needed equity commitments for a potential transaction. That same day, Cloudera and KKR entered into a new confidentiality\nagreement relating to the potential transaction.\nOn May 17, 2021, Cloudera provided consent to CD&R under its existing confidentiality agreement with Cloudera in order to work with KKR on a\njoint proposal for a potential acquisition of Cloudera.\nOn May 18, 2021, representatives of CD&R and KKR contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to convey an updated verbal proposal to\nacquire Cloudera for cash based on a price of $15.15 per share of Cloudera common stock, with (1) a go-shop period of 30 days, (2) a termination fee\npayable by Cloudera of 2.0% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement to\nenter into a definitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal prior to the end of the go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of\n3.5% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement under certain other\ncircumstances or if CD&R terminated the merger agreement as a result of a change in recommendation by the Board of Directors and (4) a reverse\ntermination fee payable by CD&R and KKR of 5.25% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if CD&R and KKR\nterminated the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including due to lack of availability of debt financing. Representatives of CD&R also\nindicated that they would expect a customary transaction support agreement from the Icahn Group executed at the time of signing the merger agreement.\nSuch support agreement would require the Icahn Group to vote its shares of Cloudera common stock in favor of the merger, subject to certain exceptions.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley indicated to CD&R that the proposal price would not be sufficient but that they would revert with a complete\nresponse after discussion with the M&A Committee.\nOn May 19, 2021, the M&A Committee held a meeting via videoconference with certain other directors and representatives of Cloudera senior\nmanagement, Latham and Morgan Stanley present. Mr. Bearden provided an\n35\nTable of Contents\nupdate to the M&A Committee on the status of discussions with CD&R and KKR, and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the details of the\nlatest proposal from CD&R and KKR, including certain related preliminary financial analysis. Following discussion, the M&A Committee determined that\nthe proposal from CD&R did not represent an adequate proposal and instructed Morgan Stanley to respond with a counter-proposal of $16.25 in cash per\nshare of Cloudera common stock, with the goal of achieving a price of at least $16.00 per share. The M&A Committee also instructed Morgan Stanley to\nrespond with a request for (1) a go-shop period of 40 days, (2) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of 1.5% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the\naggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal prior to\nthe end of the go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of 3.0% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration\nif Cloudera terminated the merger agreement under certain other circumstances or if CD&R terminated the merger agreement as a result of a change in\nrecommendation by the Board of Directors and (4) a reverse termination fee payable by CD&R and KKR of 6.0% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the\naggregate merger consideration if CD&R and KKR terminated the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including due to lack of availability of\ndebt financing. The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on May 19, 2021 was $12.07 per\nshare.\nFollowing the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted representatives of CD&R to relay the counter-proposal as outlined by the\nM&A Committee.\nOn May 21, 2021, representatives of Kirkland sent to representatives of Latham an initial draft of the merger agreement for the transaction, which\nreflected the previously outlined terms of the go-shop and termination fees proposed by CD&R and KKR.\nOn May 24, 2021, representatives of CD&R and KKR contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to indicate that they would provide an updated\nproposal to Cloudera later that week. Members of Cloudera\u2019s senior management provided the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts to CD&R and KKR on\nthat same day.\nLater that same day, representatives of Kirkland sent to representatives of Latham an initial draft of the support agreement to be executed by the\nIcahn Group in connection with the transaction.\nOn May 25, 2021, the Board of Directors, with representatives of Cloudera senior management, Latham and Morgan Stanley present, held a meeting\nto discuss the latest status of discussions with CD&R and KKR. At the same meeting, the Board of Directors also reviewed the May 2021 Final Updated\nForecasts and the related extrapolations for fiscal years 2025 through 2031 with Cloudera\u2019s senior management. In connection with such review, the Board\nof Directors directed Morgan Stanley to use the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and the related extrapolations for fiscal years 2025 through 2031, or a\nsubset thereof, in performing its financial analyses in connection with its financial fairness opinion. The Board of Directors also discussed certain\n\u201cstretch case\u201d forecasts in the Upside Scenario, which had previously been provided to CD&R as part of evaluating a potential acquisition of Cloudera.\nThe Board of Directors concluded that the Upside Scenario was unlikely to be achieved and that Cloudera\u2019s prospects as a stand-alone company should\nbe evaluated on the basis of the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts. The May 2020 Forecasts, the December 2020 Board Plan, the March 2021 Board Plan,\nthe May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and the Upside Scenario are each described in the section entitled \u201c-Management Projections\u201d beginning on page\n51 of this proxy statement.\nOn May 26, 2021, representatives of CD&R and KKR contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to convey an updated proposal to acquire\nCloudera for cash based on a price of $15.60 per share of Cloudera common stock, with (1) a go-shop period of 35 days, (2) a termination fee payable by\nCloudera of 1.75% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement to enter into a\ndefinitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal prior to the end of the go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of 3.75% of\nCloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement under certain circumstances or if\nCD&R\n36\nTable of Contents\nterminated the merger agreement as a result of a change in recommendation by the Board of Directors and (4) a reverse termination fee payable by CD&R\nand KKR of 5.5% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if CD&R and KKR terminated the merger agreement under\ncertain circumstances, including due to lack of availability of debt financing. Representatives of Morgan Stanley responded, based on their discussions\nwith the Board of Directors, that they would not expect the Board of Directors to accept anything less than $16.00 per share but that the Board of\nDirectors might be willing to consider terms less favorable to Cloudera on the go-shop in exchange for a higher price.\nLater that same evening, representatives of Latham sent to representatives of Kirkland comments on behalf of Cloudera on the draft merger\nagreement and an initial draft of Cloudera\u2019s disclosure schedules, as well as comments from the Icahn Group on the draft support agreement.\nOn May 27, 2021, representatives of CD&R and KKR contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to convey their \u201cbest and final\u201d package\nproposal to acquire Cloudera for cash based on a price of $16.00 per share of Cloudera common stock, with (1) a go-shop period of 30 days (subject to\nextension for another 10 days for parties which submit an acquisition proposal during the initial 30-day go-shop period that the Board determines is\nreasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal), (2) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of 1.75% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate\nmerger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal prior to the end of\nthe go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of 3.75% of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if\nCloudera terminated the merger agreement under certain circumstances or if CD&R terminated the merger agreement as a result of a change in\nrecommendation by the Board of Directors and (4) a reverse termination fee of 5.5% payable by CD&R and KKR of Cloudera\u2019s equity value based on the\naggregate merger consideration if CD&R and KKR terminated the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including due to lack of availability of\ndebt financing.\nBetween May 28, 2021 and May 31, 2021, representatives of Latham and Kirkland negotiated and finalized the terms of the merger agreement,\nincluding, the go-shop procedures, the financing cooperation covenant, and the materiality bring-down threshold with respect to the capitalization\nrepresentation at closing, and the equity commitment letters, limited guaranties, debt commitment letter and disclosure schedules. In addition,\nrepresentatives of Kirkland and the Icahn Group negotiated and finalized the terms of the support agreement to be executed by the Icahn Group,\nincluding the right of the Icahn Group to act as a representative of Cloudera in connection with the go-shop. All open points in the transaction\ndocuments were substantially resolved by the afternoon of May 31, 2021.\nOn May 31, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley sent a memorandum to Latham, who in turn shared the memorandum with the Board of\nDirectors, disclosing certain relationships between Morgan Stanley and certain of its affiliates, on the one hand, and CD&R and KKR, on the other hand.\nOn May 31, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting via videoconference, with representatives of Cloudera senior management, Latham and\nMorgan Stanley present. Latham reviewed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties and also provided an overview of the disclosure memorandum\nprovided by Morgan Stanley. The Board of Directors determined that the relationships did not reflect a material conflict in the context of the proposed\ntransaction. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then reviewed their financial analyses of the merger consideration, and representatives of Latham\nreviewed the proposed terms of the merger agreement, support agreement, equity commitment letters, limited guaranties and debt commitment letter.\nThereafter, the representatives of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board of Directors Morgan Stanley\u2019s oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing,\nthat, as of May 31, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and\nlimitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received\nby the holders of shares of Cloudera Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a\nfinancial point of view to such holders of shares of Cloudera Common Stock. After further deliberation and discussion, the Board of Directors\nunanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Cloudera and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger\n37\nTable of Contents\nagreement and consummate the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (ii) approved the execution and delivery of the\nmerger agreement by Cloudera, the performance by Cloudera of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the merger\nupon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Cloudera adopt the merger agreement\nin accordance with the DGCL and (iv) approved the support agreement.\nOn June 1, 2021, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement, support agreement, equity commitment letters, limited guaranties and\ndebt commitment letter.\nEarly in the morning on June 1, 2021 prior to the opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the parties issued a press release announcing\nthe transaction.\nThe \u201cGo-Shop\u201d Period\nBeginning on June 1, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley reached out to 17 parties to invite such parties to participate in Cloudera\u2019s go-shop\nprocess. Such parties were identified as having the most likely strategic interest in acquiring Cloudera and the financial capability to complete an\nacquisition. Ten of the contacted parties were strategic parties, and the remaining seven parties were potential private equity bidders.\nAll of the invited parties indicated they were not interested in pursuing an acquisition of Cloudera, without any request to do due diligence.\nAt 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on July 1, 2021, the \u201cgo\u2013shop\u201d period ended with Cloudera not having received any alternative acquisition\nproposals.",

the\nmaterial information and factors considered by the Board of Directors in consideration of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of factors\nconsidered by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board of Directors did not\nfind it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and\nrecommendation. Rather, in considering the information and factors described above, individual members of the Board of Directors each applied his or her\nown personal business judgment to the process and may have given differing weights to differing factors. The Board of Directors based its unanimous\nrecommendation on the totality of the information presented. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking\nstatements that should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOpinion of Morgan Stanley\nCloudera retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with the possible sale of\nCloudera. The Board of Directors selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, expertise and\nreputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in Cloudera\u2019s industry, its knowledge of Cloudera\u2019s business and affairs and its\nunderstanding of Cloudera\u2019s business based on its long-standing relationship with Cloudera. At the meeting of the Board of Directors on May 31, 2021,\nMorgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of May 31, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in\nthe written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera common stock (other than the holders of the\nExcluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Cloudera common stock.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of May 31, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its\nopinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. The summary of the\nopinion of Morgan Stanley in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was directed to the Board of Directors, in its capacity as such, and\naddresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera\ncommon stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion and does not address the\nrelative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could\nbe achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how Cloudera stockholders should vote\nat the special meeting. The summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the\nopinion.\n42\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Cloudera\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Cloudera\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the Management Projections (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Management Projections\u201d)\n(which were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by the management of Cloudera)\u037e\n\u2022\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Cloudera with senior executives of Cloudera\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Cloudera common stock\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial performance of Cloudera and the prices and trading activity of Cloudera common stock with that of certain\nother publicly traded companies comparable with Cloudera, and their securities\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nparticipated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of Cloudera, Parent and their respective financial and legal\nadvisors\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed (i) the Merger Agreement, (ii) the following agreements, in each case, substantially in the form of the draft provided to\nMorgan Stanley on May 31, 2021: the Financing Letters, the Guaranties and the Voting Agreement among the stockholders of\nCloudera party thereto and Cloudera, and (iii) certain related documents\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed\nappropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by Cloudera, and formed a substantial basis for its\nopinion. With respect to the Management Projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments of Cloudera\u2019s management of the future financial performance of Cloudera. Morgan Stanley expressed no\nview as to such Management Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger will be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions,\nincluding among other things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Financing Letters, and that the definitive\nMerger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in\nconnection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays,\nlimitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the\nproposed merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without\nindependent verification, the assessment of Cloudera and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan\nStanley\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or\nwhether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or\nnature of the compensation to any of Cloudera\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Per Share Merger\nConsideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the merger. Morgan\nStanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Cloudera, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with\n43\nTable of Contents\nany such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on,\nand the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, May 31, 2021. Events occurring after May 31, 2021 may affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and\nthe assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of\nits written opinion letter dated as of May 31, 2021 to the Board of Directors. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses\ndescribed represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of\neach summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below\nmust be considered as a whole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors,\ncould create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and relied upon (i) the financial\nprojections prepared by Cloudera\u2019s management, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts, and (ii) the median\nestimates of equity research analysts, which we refer to as the Street Case. The May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts are more fully described below in the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Management Projections.\u201d In accordance with direction from the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley\nutilized the Street Case and May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts in its financial analyses described below.\nPublic Trading Comparables Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to\nsimilar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for Cloudera with comparable publicly\navailable consensus equity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, that\nshare similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or\nrevenue growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the\n\u201ccomparable companies\u201d). These companies were the following:\nFinancial Profile Peers:\nAlarm.com, Inc.\nBox, Inc.\nCadence Design Systems, Inc.\nDropbox, Inc.\nFair Isaac Corporation\nFireEye, Inc.\nGoDaddy Inc.\nInovalon Inc.\nPegasystems Inc.\nSage Group, plc\nSynopsys Inc.\nZuora, Inc.\n44\nTable of Contents\nEnterprise Software / Data Management Peers:\nAlteryx, Inc.\nC3.ai Inc.\nCisco Systems, Inc.\nInternational Business Machines Corporation\nMongoDB, Inc.\nNew Relic, Inc.\nNutanix, Inc.\nOracle Corporation\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nPure Storage, Inc.\nSAP SE\nSnowflake, Inc.\nSplunk Inc.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue, which, for purposes of this analysis, (i)\nfor Cloudera, (x) were provided to Morgan Stanley, and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use, by Cloudera\u2019s management for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 for\nthe May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts, and (y) were based on the median of publicly available equity analyst research estimates for calendar years 2021\nand 2022 for the Street Case\u037e and (ii) for each of the comparable companies, were based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates\nfor comparison purposes. For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined \u201caggregate value\u201d as a company\u2019s fully diluted equity value plus total\ndebt, plus non-controlling interest, less cash and cash equivalents. Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies\nand upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of aggregate value to revenue\nmultiples and applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant metric for Cloudera. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized\npublicly available financial information, available as of May 28, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and\nadopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nmerger).\nBased on the outstanding shares of Cloudera common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by Cloudera\u2019s management and the selected\nranges of aggregate value to revenue, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of Cloudera common stock as follows:\nPublic Trading Multiples\nSelected\nComparable\nCloudera\nMultiple Ranges\nImplied Value Per\nShare of\nCloudera\nCommon Stock ($)\nCY 2021E AV / Revenue\nStreet Case\n4.0x \u2013 6.5x\n12.36 \u2013 19.29\nMay 2021 Final Updated Forecasts\n4.0x \u2013 6.5x\n12.65 \u2013 19.76\nCY 2022E AV / Revenue\nStreet Case\n3.5x \u2013 6.0x\n11.94 \u2013 19.56\nMay 2021 Final Updated Forecasts\n3.5x \u2013 6.0x\n12.35 \u2013 20.26\nNo company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to Cloudera. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley\nmade numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other\nmatters, many of which are beyond Cloudera\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Cloudera\u2019s business and the\nindustry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Cloudera and the\nindustry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of\nusing comparable company data.\n45\nTable of Contents\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity value of a\ncompany as a function of such company\u2019s estimated future revenue and levered free cash flow (\u201cLFCF\u201d). The resulting equity value is subsequently\ndiscounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present\nequity values per share of the Cloudera common stock on a standalone basis for each of the Street Case and May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts.\nTo calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized calendar year 2023 revenue estimates and LFCF estimates under\neach of the Street Case and the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan\nStanley applied a forward range of aggregate value to revenue multiples and fully diluted equity value to LFCF multiples (based on the range of aggregate\nvalue to revenue multiples and fully diluted equity value to LFCF multiples for the comparable companies) to these revenue and LFCF estimates in order\nto reach a future implied fully diluted equity value.\nIn each case, Morgan Stanley then added projected net cash to Cloudera\u2019s future implied aggregate value to reach a future implied fully diluted\nequity value. In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided the future implied fully diluted equity value by estimated fully diluted shares outstanding (with\nsuch estimates provided by Cloudera management) to calculate a per share price. In each case, Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied\nfuture per share price to May 28, 2021, at a discount rate of 8.6 percent, which rate was selected based on Cloudera\u2019s estimated cost of equity, which was\narrived at by applying the capital asset pricing model, to calculate the discounted fully diluted equity value.\nBased on Calendar Year 2023\nEstimated Revenue\nSelected EV /\nLFCF\nMultiple\nRanges\nImplied Value Per\nShare of\nCloudera Common\nStock ($)\nStreet Case\n4.0x \u2013 6.5x\n11.85 \u2013 18.26\nMay 2021 Final Updated Forecasts\n4.0x \u2013 6.5x\n12.78 \u2013 19.71\nBased on Calendar Year 2023\nEstimated LFCF\nSelected EV /\nLFCF\nMultiple\nRanges\nImplied Value Per\nShare of\nCloudera Common\nStock ($)\nStreet Case\n15.0x \u2013 35.0x\n7.88 \u2013 18.34\nMay 2021 Final Updated Forecasts\n15.0x \u2013 35.0x\n8.54 \u2013 19.87\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the present\nvalue of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share\nfor the Cloudera common stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value Cloudera as a stand-alone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates\nfrom the Street Case and May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and\namortization, less (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) cash taxes, (3) changes in net working capital, and (4) capital expenditures. Each of the Street\nCase and the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts included estimates through 2030 prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use\nby Cloudera\u2019s management. The free cash flows and terminal values were discounted, using a mid-year convention, to present values as of May 28, 2021\nat a discount rate ranging from 7.1 percent to 8.9 percent, which discount rates were selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional\njudgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of Cloudera\u2019s weighted average cost of capital determined by the application of the capital asset pricing\nmodel. In its analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized perpetuity growth rates of 2.5% to 3.5%. Such perpetuity growth rates were selected upon the application\nof Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgement and experience. The resulting aggregate value was then adjusted for net cash and further adjusted for the\nnet present value of net operating losses.\n46\nTable of Contents\nBased on the outstanding shares of Cloudera common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by Cloudera\u2019s management, Morgan Stanley\ncalculated the estimated implied value per share of Cloudera common stock as follows:\nImplied Value Per\nShare of Cloudera\nCommon Stock ($)\nStreet Case\n10.68 \u2013 18.68\nMay 2021 Final Updated Forecasts\n12.57 \u2013 22.34\nPrecedent Transactions Multiples Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly\navailable financial terms. Morgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for selected software transactions. Morgan Stanley selected such\ncomparable transactions because they shared certain characteristics with the merger, most notably because they were similar software transactions. For\nsuch transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the estimated aggregate value of the transaction to the next 12 months (which we refer to as \u201cNTM\u201d) Revenue\nbased on publicly available information at the time of announcement of each such transaction.\nThe following is a list of the selected software transactions reviewed, together with the applicable multiples:\nSelected Software Transactions (Target/Acquiror)\nAV /\nNTM\nRevenue\nAthenahealth, Inc. / Veritas Capital, Evergreen Coast Capital\n3.9x\nAVG Technologies N.V. / Avast Software s.r.o.\n3.3x\nBarracuda Networks, Inc. / Thoma Bravo, LP\n3.8x\nCa, Inc.

The following table summarizes Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nanalysis:\nPrecedent Multiples\nRepresentative\nRanges\nImplied Value Per\nShare of\nCloudera Common\nStock ($)\nStreet Case\n4.0x \u2013 7.0x\n12.36 \u2013 20.68\nNo company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to Cloudera or the merger. In evaluating the precedent\ntransactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and\nfinancial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Cloudera\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on\nCloudera\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and\nprospects of Cloudera and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the\naggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present\nvalue per share of Cloudera derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the consideration is not necessarily\ndispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis of the consideration for the merger but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.\nOther Information\nMorgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analysis with respect to its opinion, but\nwhich were noted as reference data for the Board of Directors, including the following information described under the sections of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c\u2014Illustrative Precedent Premiums,\u201d \u201c\u2014Historical Trading Ranges\u201d and \u201c\u2014Equity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets.\u201d\nIllustrative Precedent Premiums\nMorgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent premiums analysis by reviewing the same sets of comparable transactions as under the\nPrecedent Transactions Multiples Analysis. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the distributions of the implied premium to the acquired\ncompany\u2019s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the last trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition\nrumors or similar news) and the distributions of the 30-day average premium to the acquired company\u2019s closing share price on the last trading day prior to\nannouncement (or the last trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar news).\nBased on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan\nStanley selected a representative range of premia and applied such range to each of Cloudera\u2019s closing share price on May 28, 2021 (the last full trading\nday prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and\napprove the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger).\nThe following table summarizes such calculations:\nPremia\nRepresentative\nRanges\nImplied Value Per\nShare of\nCloudera Common\nStock ($)\nPremia to 1-Day Unaffected Share Price\n20% \u2013 40%\n15.43 \u2013 18.00\nPremia to 30-Day Unaffected Average\n20% \u2013 40%\n14.81 \u2013 17.28\nHistorical Trading Ranges\nMorgan Stanley noted certain trading ranges with respect to the historical share prices of Cloudera common stock. Morgan Stanley reviewed a\nrange of closing prices of the Cloudera common stock for various periods\n48\nTable of Contents\nending on March 28, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the\nadvisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger). Morgan Stanley observed the\nfollowing:\nPeriods Ended April 23, 2021\nRange of Trading\nPrices\nPer Share of\nCloudera\nCommon Stock ($)\nLast 30 Days\n11.43 \u2013 13.16\nLast 90 Days\n11.43 \u2013 18.99\nLast 365 Days\n9.61 \u2013 18.99\nEquity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets\nMorgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for Cloudera common stock prepared and published by equity research\nanalysts prior to May 28, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,\ndeclare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger). These targets reflected each\nanalyst\u2019s estimate of the future public market trading price of Cloudera common stock. The undiscounted analyst price targets in the 25th to 75th\npercentile range for the Cloudera common stock were $14.00 to $16.00 per share as of various dates ranging from March 11, 2021 to April 23, 2021. Morgan\nStanley discounted such range of analyst price targets per share for the Cloudera common stock by one year at a rate of 8.6 percent, which discount rate\nwas selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, to reflect Cloudera\u2019s cost of equity. This analysis\nindicated an implied range of fully diluted equity values for Cloudera common stock of $12.66 to $14.73 per share, as discounted by one year based on\nundiscounted analyst price targets, as of May 28, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the\nMerger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger).\nThe public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for Cloudera\ncommon stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of Cloudera and future financial market\nconditions.\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the merger by the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses\nfor purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis\nor summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any\nparticular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all\nanalyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given\nvarious analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than\nother assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan\nStanley\u2019s view of the actual value of Cloudera. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Cloudera\u2019s control.\nThese include, among other things, the impact of competition on Cloudera\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of\nany adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Cloudera and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates\ncontained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable\nthan those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share\nMerger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera\n49\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion\ndated as of May 31, 2021 to the Board of Directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of Cloudera\ncommon stock might actually trade. The Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera common stock (other than\nthe holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Cloudera and Parent\nand was approved by the Board of Directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Board of Directors during these negotiations but did not, however,\nrecommend any specific consideration to Cloudera or the Board of Directors, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration constituted\nthe only appropriate consideration for the merger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other\nalternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion\nwas not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how Cloudera stockholders should vote at the special meeting.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of\nDirectors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the\nopinion of the Board of Directors with respect to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of whether the Board of Directors would have\nbeen willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and\nother professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley\u2019s customary practice.\nThe Board of Directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global\nfinancial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is\nengaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as\nproviding investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a\nprincipal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions,\nfor their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of CD&R, KKR and their respective affiliates, or any other\ncompany, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided Cloudera financial advisory services and an opinion, described in this section\nand attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the merger, and Cloudera has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately\n$58 million for its services, $2.5 million of which has been paid following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached as this proxy\nstatement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Cloudera has also agreed to reimburse Morgan\nStanley for its expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition,\nCloudera has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other\nperson, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nIn the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financing services for Cloudera and\nreceived aggregate fees of approximately $10 to 20 million in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial advisory and financing services for CD&R, and certain of its affiliates and their\naffiliated funds\u2019 respective portfolio companies (the \u201cCD&R Related Entities\u201d), and for KKR and certain of its affiliates and their affiliated funds\u2019\nrespective portfolio companies (the \u201cKKR Related Entities\u201d), and have received aggregate fees of approximately $15 to 25 million in connection with such\nservices from CD&R and the CD&R Related Entities, and fees of greater than approximately $100 million in connection with\n50\nTable of Contents\nsuch services from KKR and the KKR Related Entities. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Cloudera\nand the KKR Related Entities or CD&R Related Entities and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of\nthese services.\nManagement Projections",

            "text": "Management Projections\nSummary of Management Projections\nAlthough Cloudera has publicly issued limited short-term guidance concerning certain aspects of its expected financial performance, it does not, as\na matter of course, make public disclosure of detailed forecasts or projections of its expected financial performance for extended periods due to, among\nother things, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may prove\nincorrect. However, in connection with the transaction, Cloudera\u2019s senior management prepared and approved for use certain unaudited prospective\nfinancial information which was provided to and considered by the Board of Directors and which was provided to each of Morgan Stanley, CD&R and\nKKR, in each case as set forth herein.\nCloudera\u2019s senior management initially prepared certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2020 through 2023\nin May 2020 and such non-public, unaudited prospective financial information was discussed with, and approved for use by, the Board of Directors at a\nmeeting held on May 29, 2020 (the \u201cMay 2020 Forecasts\u201d). The May 2020 Forecasts were shared with representatives of CD&R and KKR, along with\nother potential bidders, in May and June 2020 in connection with soliciting potential interest in an acquisition of Cloudera.\nCloudera\u2019s senior management subsequently prepared certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2021 through\n2024 in December 2020 and such non-public, unaudited prospective financial information was discussed with, and approved for use by, the Board of\nDirectors at a meeting held on December 15, 2020 (the \u201cDecember 2020 Board Plan\u201d). The December 2020 Board Plan was shared with representatives of\nCD&R on January 12, 2021 in connection with their due diligence review of Cloudera.\nIn March 2021, the December 2020 Board Plan was subsequently adjusted to reflect Cloudera\u2019s actual results for its fiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 (the \u201cMarch 2021 Board Plan\u201d). The Board of Directors reviewed and approved the March 2021 Board Plan during a meeting held on March 16, 2021.\nIn parallel with preparing the March 2021 Board Plan, Cloudera\u2019s senior management also prepared certain \u201cstretch case\u201d projections which were\nprovided to CD&R as part of evaluating a potential acquisition of Cloudera and reflected an approximately 15% annual recurring revenue growth rate for\nfiscal year 2022 (the \u201cUpside Scenario\u201d). The March 2021 Board Plan and the Upside Scenario were shared with representatives of CD&R on April 12,\n2021 in connection with their consideration of the transaction.\nIn May 2021, the March 2021 Board Plan was further updated to reflect Cloudera\u2019s actual results for its fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2021 (the\n\u201cMay 2021 Final Updated Forecasts\u201d). Morgan Stanley subsequently prepared certain unaudited prospective extrapolations based on the May 2021 Final\nUpdated Forecasts for the fiscal years 2025 through 2031, which were reviewed and approved for use by Morgan Stanley by Cloudera\u2019s senior\nmanagement. The Board of Directors reviewed the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and the related extrapolations for fiscal years 2025 through 2031\nwith Cloudera\u2019s senior management during its meeting held on May 25, 2021. In connection with such review, the Board of Directors directed Morgan\nStanley to use the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and the related extrapolations for fiscal years 2025 through 2031, or a subset thereof, in performing\nits financial analyses in connection with its financial fairness opinion, as described in more detail in the section \u201c - Opinion of Morgan Stanley\u201d above.\nThe May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts was shared with representatives of CD&R and KKR on May 24, 2021 in connection with their consideration of the\ntransaction. The related extrapolations for fiscal years 2025 through 2031 and the unlevered free cash flow numbers were not provided to CD&R and\nKKR.\n51Table of Contents\nWe refer to any of the May 2020 Forecasts, the December 2020 Board Plan, the March 2021 Board Plan, the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and\nrelated extrapolated projections for fiscal years 2025 through 2031 and the Upside Scenario as the \u201cManagement Projections.\u201d The Management\nProjections were prepared by Cloudera on a stand-alone basis and do not take into account the transactions, including any costs incurred in connection\nwith the transaction or any changes to Cloudera\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the completion of the transaction.

The non-\nGAAP financial measures used in the Management Projections were relied upon by the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the\ntransaction, and the Board of Directors directed Morgan Stanley to use the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and the related extrapolations for fiscal\nyears 2025 through 2031, or a subset thereof, in performing its financial analyses in connection with its financial fairness opinion, as described in more\ndetail above in the section \u201c\u2013 Opinion of Morgan Stanley\u201d. The SEC rules, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to a GAAP financial measure, do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to Morgan Stanley or to the Board of Directors in\nconnection with a proposed business combination like the merger if the disclosure is included in a document like this proxy statement. In addition,\nreconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to a GAAP financial measure were not\n53\nTable of Contents\nrelied upon by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its opinion or by the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the merger agreement and\nthe merger. Accordingly, Cloudera has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Management Projections to the relevant\nGAAP financial measures. In addition, the Management Projections were not prepared with a view towards complying with GAAP. The Management\nProjections may differ from published analyst estimates and forecasts and do not take into account any events or circumstances after the date they were\nprepared, including the announcement of the merger.\nWhile the Management Projections are presented with numerical specificity, the Management Projections were based on numerous variables and\nassumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond Cloudera management\u2019s control. Further, given that the Management Projections cover\nmultiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year beyond their preparation. Important factors that may\naffect actual results and may result in such projections not being achieved include: risks and uncertainties detailed in Cloudera\u2019s public periodic filings\nwith the SEC. In addition, the ability to achieve the Management Projections may depend on, in part, whether or not the strategic goals, objectives and\ntargets are reached over the applicable period. The assumptions upon which the Management Projections were based necessarily involve judgments with\nrespect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and regulatory conditions and financial market conditions and future business decisions\nthat may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies,\nincluding, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industry in which Cloudera operates, and\nthe risks and uncertainties described in the section \u201c\u2013Forward-Looking Statements\u201d, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and\nmany of which are beyond our control. The Management Projections also reflect assumptions by Cloudera management that are subject to change and\nare susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results, revised prospects for the Cloudera business, changes in general\nbusiness or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated when such\nprojections were prepared.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized, and actual results may differ, and may differ materially,\nfrom those shown. The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of Cloudera,\nMorgan Stanley, CD&R, KKR or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives considered or consider the\nManagement Projections necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the Management Projections should not be relied upon as such. None of\nCloudera, Morgan Stanley, CD&R, KKR or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives can give any assurance\nthat actual results will not differ from the Management Projections. None of Cloudera, Morgan Stanley, CD&R, KKR or any of their respective affiliates,\nofficers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any stockholder of Cloudera or other person regarding the\nultimate performance of Cloudera compared to the information contained in the Management Projections or that forecasted results will be achieved.\nIn addition, the Management Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date they were prepared or as\nof the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Cloudera does not intend to update or otherwise revise the\nManagement Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of\nfuture events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.\nThe Management Projections were prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Cloudera\u2019s management. Ernst & Young LLP has not audited,\nreviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the Management Projections and, accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP\ndoes not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nInterests of Executive Officers and Directors of Cloudera in the Merger",

The Board of\nDirectors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nhereby, including the Merger, and in making their recommendation that Cloudera\u2019s stockholders approve the Merger Agreement.\nFor purposes of this disclosure:\n\u2022\nThe \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d of Cloudera are:\n\u2022\nRobert Bearden, Chief Executive Officer\u037e\n\u2022\nJim Frankola, Chief Financial Officer\u037e and\n\u2022\nArun Murthy, Chief Product Officer.\n\u2022\nThe executive officers of Cloudera since the beginning of Cloudera\u2019s last fiscal year on February 1, 2020 are:\n\u2022\nthe named executive officers\u037e and\n\u2022\nMick Hollison, President.\nTreatment of Cloudera Equity Awards\nThe Merger Agreement provides that each Company Option that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled\nand converted into the right to receive the Option Consideration.

We estimate that the\naggregate value of unvested equity awards held by all non-employee directors of Cloudera that would vest assuming that the Merger occurs on June 25,\n2021 is $3,191,536.\nCloudera Severance and Change in Control Arrangements\nChief Executive Officer Employment Agreement\nPursuant to Mr. Bearden\u2019s offer letter with Cloudera, Mr. Bearden is entitled to certain payments and benefits upon a termination of employment\neffected by Cloudera without \u201ccause\u201d or by Mr. Bearden for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each as defined in the offer letter). These payments and benefits will be\nsubject to Mr. Bearden\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form prescribed by Cloudera.\n55\nTable of Contents\nIf the termination occurs during the period commencing three months prior to and ending 12 months following a \u201cchange in control\u201d (as defined in\nthe offer letter, and which includes the Merger), Mr. Bearden will be entitled to receive the following:\n\u2022\na lump sum payment equal to the sum of (i) 18 months of his annual base salary, (ii) his annual target bonus (calculated as if all\napplicable bonus targets were achieved), and (iii) a prorated portion of his annual target bonus (calculated as if all applicable bonus\ntargets were achieved and based on the number of days employed during the bonus period, less any portion previously paid)\u037e\n\u2022\nCOBRA premiums (or a taxable payment in an amount equal to such premiums) until the earlier of the end of an 18-month period or the\ndate when receiving similar coverage with a new employer\u037e and\n\u2022\naccelerated vesting of 100% of any then-unvested shares and other equity awards.\nIn addition, if the successor or acquiring corporation refuses to assume, convert, replace or substitute Mr. Bearden\u2019s then-unvested shares or other\nequity awards in connection with a change in control, the then-unvested shares and other equity awards shall become fully vested effective immediately\nprior to the change in control.\nSeverance and Change in Control Agreements\nCloudera has entered into Severance and Change in Control Agreements (\u201cSeverance Agreements\u201d) with each of its executive officers, other than\nMr. Bearden, which entitle the executive officers to certain payments and benefits upon a termination of employment effected by Cloudera without\n\u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each as defined in the applicable Severance Agreement). These payments and benefits will be subject to\nthe executive officer\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form prescribed by Cloudera.\nIf the termination occurs during the period commencing three months prior to and ending 24 months following a \u201cchange in control\u201d (as defined in\nthe Severance Agreements, and which includes the Merger), the executive officer will be entitled to receive the following:\n\u2022\na lump sum payment equal to the sum of (i) the executive\u2019s then-current base salary, (ii) the executive\u2019s then-current annual target\nbonus (calculated as if all applicable bonus targets were achieved, and to the extent the target bonus is paid more frequently than\nannually, bonus amounts will be aggregated to represent a full year), and (iii) a prorated portion of the executive\u2019s then-current annual\ntarget bonus (calculated as if all applicable bonus targets were achieved and based on the number of days worked during the bonus\nperiod, less any portion previously paid, and to the extent the target bonus is paid more frequently than annually, bonus amounts will\nbe aggregated to represent a full year)\u037e\n\u2022\nup to 12 months of COBRA premiums (or a taxable payment in an amount equal to such premiums)\u037e\n\u2022\naccelerated vesting of 100% of all outstanding equity awards (and with respect to awards that would otherwise vest upon satisfaction\nof performance criteria, this acceleration will apply at the target level of the performance criteria unless specifically provided otherwise\nin the equity award agreement)\u037e and\n\u2022\na 12-month post-termination exercise window for all outstanding non-qualified stock options.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Cloudera\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and\ncoverage for a period of six (6) years following the effective time under\n56\nTable of Contents\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies from the surviving corporation. This indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the\nsection captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u2014Indemnification and Insurance.\u201d\nNew Compensation Arrangements with Parent\nAny Cloudera executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide services to\nParent or the Surviving Corporation following the closing of the Merger may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and may\nparticipate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, no compensation arrangements between such persons and Parent and/or its affiliates have been established.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits to Cloudera\u2019s Named Executive Officers\nThe table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of Cloudera\u2019s named executive officers would receive in connection with\nthe Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and each such named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination on June 25, 2021\n(which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure)\u037e (ii) a per share price of Cloudera common stock of\n$16.00 (the Per Share Merger Consideration)\u037e (iii) that each named executive officer\u2019s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from\nthose in effect as of the date of this proxy statement\u037e and (iv) equity awards that are outstanding as of June 25, 2021. The calculations in the table below\ndo not include any amounts that the named executive officers were entitled to receive or that were vested as of the date hereof. In addition, these\namounts do not attempt to forecast any additional awards, grants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. As a result of the\nforegoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to\nthe table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may differ materially from the amounts set forth below.\nFor purposes of this discussion, \u201csingle trigger\u201d refers to benefits that arise solely as a result of the completion of the Merger and \u201cdouble trigger\u201d\nrefers to benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the Merger and a qualifying termination. Payments of double trigger benefits\nare contingent on the named executive officer signing and not revoking a release of claims in favor of Cloudera, as described above under \u201c\u2014Cloudera\nSeverance and Change in Control Arrangements.\u201d\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nName\nCash ($)(1)\nEquity ($)(2)\nPerquisites/Benefits\n($)(3)\nTotal ($)(4)\nRobert Bearden\n1,548,973\n31,117,728\n40,305\n32,707,006\nJim Frankola\n763,425\n9,196,624\n18,833\n9,978,882\nArun Murthy\n675,932\n21,930,576\n26,870\n22,633,378\n(1)\nCash.

Under the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time each Company RSU Award and each Company PSU Award that is outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time (and that does not vest by its terms at the Effective Time) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to\nreceive the RSU Consideration and the PSU Consideration, respectively, that vests on the original time-based vesting schedule of the related\nCompany RSU Award and Company PSU Award (without regard to any performance requirement). Even though payment of the PSU Consideration\nis subject to the time-based vesting schedule of the related Company PSU Award, because the PSU Consideration is no longer subject to the\nperformance-based vesting schedule of the related Company PSU Award, the PSU Consideration may constitute a single trigger benefit. Under the\ndouble trigger arrangements in Mr. Bearden\u2019s offer letter and the other executive officers\u2019 Severance Agreements, each named executive officer is\neligible to receive 100% vesting acceleration for their outstanding Cloudera equity awards upon a qualifying termination of employment that occurs\nwithin the period beginning three months before and ending 24 months (or, for Mr. Bearden, 12 months) after a change in control, as described\nabove under \u201c\u2014 Cloudera Severance and Change in Control Arrangements\u201d, and this accelerated vesting applies to the RSU Consideration and\nthe PSU Consideration. The amount reported represents the value of Merger consideration that would be received in respect of Company RSU\nAwards and Company PSU Awards upon a qualifying termination. No named executive officer holds unvested Company Options.\nThe following table quantifies the value of the RSU Consideration and the PSU Consideration included in the aggregate total reported in the\ncolumn.

This amount includes the aggregate dollar value of the sum of all amounts reported in the preceding columns. In the event any payment or\nbenefit received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger would be subject to excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the\nCode, the amount of such payments or benefits provided would be reduced, but only to the extent such reduction results in a greater after-tax\nbenefit to the named executive officer.\n58\nTable of Contents\nFinancing of the Merger",

            "text": "Appraisal Rights\nIf the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold shares of Cloudera common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote\nin favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their demands or\notherwise lose their rights of appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 the DGCL\n(\u201cSection 262\u201d). The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal\n61Table of Contents\nrights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated\nherein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders\nexercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of\nCloudera common stock unless otherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of Cloudera common stock is entitled to demand\nappraisal of the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Cloudera common stock held of record in the\nname of another person, such as a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized\nbelow properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Cloudera common stock through a bank, broker or other\nnominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, holders of shares of Cloudera common stock who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of their\nshares\u037e (ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective\nTime\u037e and (iv) otherwise exactly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Cloudera common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the\ncourt. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who\nhave asserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the\noutstanding shares of Cloudera common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (b) the value of the aggregate Per Share\nMerger Consideration in respect of the shares of Cloudera common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million\n(conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the \u201cownership thresholds\u201d). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for\ngood cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at\n5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any time before the\nDelaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an\namount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is\nunder no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a Merger Agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days\nprior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which\nappraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes\nCloudera\u2019s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this\nproxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of Cloudera common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or\nwho wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a\ntimely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled\nto receive the Per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising\nthe right to seek appraisal of shares of Cloudera common stock, Cloudera believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder\nshould seek the advice of legal counsel.\n62\nTable of Contents\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Cloudera common stock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Cloudera a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose\nappraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Cloudera common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee\non behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of\nthe fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and\nhas no intention of doing so.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a\nstockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not\nvote its shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of Cloudera common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Cloudera, before the vote on the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to stockholders, a written demand\nfor the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A\nholder of shares of Cloudera common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is\nmade and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will,\nunless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will\nnullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights\nmust submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting, or otherwise fail to vote, on\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The\nwritten demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote\nagainst the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the\nvote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting of Cloudera Stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Cloudera common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A\ndemand for appraisal in respect of shares of Cloudera common stock must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably\ninform Cloudera of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the\nMerger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in\ncommon, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint\nowners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must\n63\nTable of Contents\nidentify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO\nEXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A\nPERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR\nOTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS\nNECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nCloudera, Inc.\nAttention: Chief Legal Officer\n5470 Great America Parkway\nSanta Clara, California 95054\nAny holder of shares of Cloudera common stock who has delivered a written demand to Cloudera and who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement by delivering to Cloudera a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand\nmade more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court\nof Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned\nupon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nPer Share Merger Consideration within 60 days after the Effective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced and Cloudera, as the Surviving\nCorporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder\nwho withdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndoes not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised\nvalue determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share merger consideration being\noffered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of shares of Cloudera common\nstock who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of Cloudera common stock who has\ncomplied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any beneficial owner of the relevant shares) may\ncommence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of\na petition filed by a stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of\n64\nTable of Contents\nthe fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present\nintention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect\nto the fair value of the shares of Cloudera common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Cloudera common stock who desire to have their shares\nappraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Cloudera common stock within the time and in\nthe manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Cloudera common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262\ncould nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Cloudera common stock who has complied with the requirements of Section 262\nand who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting\nforth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Cloudera has received\ndemands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting\nstockholder within 10 days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of\nthe period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of Cloudera common stock held either in a voting trust or\nby a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the\nforegoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Cloudera common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving\nCorporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly\nverified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the\nvalue of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and\nplace fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the written statement described\nabove at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general\ncirculation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne by the\nSurviving Corporation. After notice to stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the\npetition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Register in\nChancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court\nof Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all\nstockholders who have asserted appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Cloudera common stock entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds described above\nhas been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndetermine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Cloudera common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of\nthe Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the\nEffective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment.\nHowever, at any time\n65\nTable of Contents\nbefore the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior\nto the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time.\nIn Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal\nproceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and\notherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light\non future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow\nexclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d In addition, the\nDelaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder\u2019s\nexclusive remedy.\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\ncould be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares\nand that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an\nopinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair\nvalue as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a\nvalue higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Neither Cloudera nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per\nShare Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Cloudera and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash\npayment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share\nof Cloudera common stock is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership\nthresholds described above has been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the\nappraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\nand charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding,\nincluding, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares\nentitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Cloudera common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses\nor withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of Cloudera common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective\nTime into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder\u2019s right to\nappraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been\nsatisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.\n66\nTable of Contents\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of Cloudera common\nstock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s\nshares of Cloudera common stock, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither\nof the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to the stockholders seeking appraisal rights, or if the stockholder delivers to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time\nor thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for\nappraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder without the\napproval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing shall not\naffect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights.\nConsequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",

The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax\nlaws, and any applicable state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed.

Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of\nCloudera common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY PARTICULAR STOCKHOLDER\nWILL DEPEND ON THE STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH\nRESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.\n68\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Holders\nThis section applies to \u201cU.S. Holders.\u201d For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is any beneficial owner of Cloudera common stock that, for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United\nStates, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the\nmeaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Cloudera common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash\nreceived in the Merger and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Cloudera common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S.\nHolder. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Cloudera common stock. A U.S.\nHolder\u2019s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of Cloudera common stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such gain or loss\nwill be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the completion of the\nMerger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. Holders who hold different blocks of Cloudera common stock (shares of Cloudera\ncommon stock purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisor to determine how the above rules apply to\nthem.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nThis section applies to \u201cNon-U.S. Holders.\u201d For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Cloudera common\nstock that is not a U.S. Holder nor an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain realized in connection with the Merger, unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable\nincome tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the\ndisposition of shares of Cloudera common stock pursuant to the Merger and certain other requirements are met\u037e or\n\u2022\nshares of Cloudera common stock constitute a United States real property interest (\u201cUSRPI\u201d) by reason of Cloudera\u2019s status as a United\nStates real property holding corporation (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and one or more other conditions are satisfied.\nGain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular rates. A Non-\nU.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a rate of 30% (or such\nlower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items.\n69\nTable of Contents\nA Non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower\nrate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on gain realized in connection with the Merger, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the\nNon-U.S. Holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal\nincome tax returns with respect to such losses.\nWe believe that Cloudera is not currently, has not been during the preceding five years and prior to or at the time of the Merger does not expect to\nbecome, a USRPHC. Because the determination of whether Cloudera is a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of Cloudera\u2019s USRPIs relative to the\nfair market value of Cloudera\u2019s non-USRPIs and other business assets, there can be no assurance that Cloudera is not or will not become a USRPHC. A\nnon-U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor about the consequences that could result if Cloudera is or were to become a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting generally will apply to payments to a U.S. Holder in connection with the Merger. Backup withholding generally will apply to\nthe proceeds received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly\ncompleted and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that such holder is not subject\nto backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.\nInformation reporting and backup withholding generally will apply to the proceeds of a disposition of shares of Cloudera common stock in the\nMerger by a non-U.S. Holder effected by or through the U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or foreign, unless the holder certifies, on a properly completed\napplicable IRS Form W-8, its status as a non-U.S. Holder and satisfies certain other requirements, or otherwise establishes an exemption. For information\nreporting purposes, dispositions effected through a non-U.S. office of a broker with certain connections with the United States will be treated in a manner\nsimilar to dispositions effected through a U.S. office of a broker. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the\ninformation reporting and backup withholding rules to them.\nCopies of information returns may be made available to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is incorporated\nunder the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding generally will be allowed as a credit against a holder\u2019s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS BASED ON CURRENT U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW. LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL\nCHANGES OR INTERPRETATIONS, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET\nFORTH THEREIN. THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT TAX ADVICE. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE\nCONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF\nANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION AND HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING SUCH\nMATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.\n70\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

            "text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nCloudera and Parent have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory notification requirements, and, subject to certain\nlimitations, to obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThese approvals include approval under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust laws (whether domestic or foreign).\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until Cloudera and Parent each file a Notification and\nReport Form with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and the applicable waiting\nperiod has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting\nperiod following the parties\u2019 filings of their respective HSR Act notification and report forms or the early termination of that waiting period. If the FTC or\nDOJ issues a request for additional information and documents (which we refer to as the \u201cSecond Request\u201d) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting\nperiod, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the\nSecond Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period.\nCloudera and Sky Parent Inc. each filed a Notification and Report Form with respect to the Merger with the FTC and DOJ on June 15, 2021. The\nwaiting period with respect to such Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time on July 15, 2021.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the\nFTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate\nexisting relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take such action under the antitrust\nlaws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We\ncannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nThe Merger is also subject to clearance or approval by the antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions and other relevant authorities under foreign\ninvestment laws. The Merger cannot be completed until Cloudera and Parent obtain clearance to consummate the Merger or the applicable waiting\nperiods have expired or been terminated in such jurisdictions. Cloudera and Parent, in consultation and cooperation with each other, made an antitrust\nfiling with the authorities of such jurisdiction.\n71Table of Contents\nPROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT",

This compensation\nis summarized in the section captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Cloudera in the Merger.\u201d The Board of Directors\nencourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly,\nCloudera is asking you to approve the following resolution:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the stockholders of Cloudera approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation that will or may become payable to\nCloudera\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the\nsection captioned \u2018The Merger\u2014Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Cloudera in the Merger.\u2019\u201d\nThe vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly,\nyou may vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve this Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the\nvote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Cloudera. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted and the Merger\nis completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this\nCompensation Proposal.\nVote Required and Board of Directors Recommendation\nApproval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding shares of Cloudera\ncommon stock representing a majority of the outstanding shares present at the Special Meeting in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present.\nAssuming a quorum is present, (i) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation\nProposal, (ii) abstentions will be treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have the same effect as a vote against the Compensation Proposal and (iii)\nbroker \u201cnon-votes\u201d (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Shares of Cloudera common stock represented by properly\nexecuted, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a Cloudera Stockholder returns a\nsigned proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of Cloudera common stock represented by that proxy will be\ncounted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended\nby the Board of Directors.\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d this proposal.\n96Table of Contents\nPROPOSAL 3: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING",

At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds, for payment to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to\nwhich such holders of Company Common Stock (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Dissenting Company Shares) become entitled pursuant to\nSection 2.7 (the \u201cExchange Fund\u201d). To the extent that the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the\nA-20Table of Contents\nlevel required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation\nto, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for\ndistribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7.

Upon receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent\nmay reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive\nin exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such holder\u2019s\ntransferred Uncertificated Shares\u037e by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred\nUncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled.

No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share\nPrice payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.10(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding\nCertificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price, without\ninterest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of\nUncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment\nthat such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7.\n(d) DTC Payment.

If a transfer of ownership of Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if\nthe Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the\nstock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so\nA-21\nTable of Contents\nsurrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise\nin proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer\nTaxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the\nsatisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the\napplicable Per Share Price with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.\n(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving\nCorporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned\nproperty, escheat or similar law.\n(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the\nCertificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate\nthereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the\nMerger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such Shares for exchange pursuant to\nthis Section 2.10 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated\nShares solely to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to\nthe Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates\nor Uncertificated Shares two years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would\notherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the\nSurviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously\nentitled thereto.",
