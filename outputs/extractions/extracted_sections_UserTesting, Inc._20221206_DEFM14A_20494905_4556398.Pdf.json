If you sell or transfer your shares of UserTesting common stock\nafter the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of\na proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and\neach of you notifies UserTesting in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to\nreceive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell\nor transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting.

        "Background of the Merger": {
            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the\nMerger Agreement. The following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the\nBoard, the Transaction Committee or our representatives and other parties.\nAs part of our ongoing consideration and evaluation of UserTesting\u2019s long-term strategic goals and\nplans, the Board and our management periodically review, consider and assess our operations and financial\nperformance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals and plans. This\nreview at times includes, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for business\ncombinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, in each case, with a view towards\nenhancing stockholder value.\nOn several occasions in 2020 and 2021, we met with representatives of Thoma Bravo and discussed our\ncompany and potential transactions involving us and Thoma Bravo, including a potential investment in or\nacquisition of us by Thoma Bravo.\n30 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn the second half of 2021, as we prepared for our initial public offering, we also evaluated a sale\ntransaction as a potential alternative to create value for our stockholders. Accordingly, in the third quarter of\n2021, we instructed representatives of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d), a lead underwriter in\nour initial public offering, to contact certain strategic and financial sponsor counterparties to determine\nwhether they would be interested in discussing a potential acquisition of our company at a valuation that\nwould be attractive compared to the valuation we expected to receive in an initial public offering. However, in\nview of market conditions at the time and the high valuations companies in our industry were receiving\nduring their own initial public offerings, we determined that pursuing an initial public offering was in the best\ninterests of our stockholders.\nOn November 17, 2021, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock at a price of $14.00\nper share. Following the initial public offering, the price of our common stock declined. During 2022 our\ncommon stock traded below the initial public offering price, with a volume weighted average price of $5.65\nduring the 90-day period ending August 19, 2022 and a 52-week low of $3.31 per share in September 2022.\nDuring 2022, equity securities of other companies in the software industry generally also experienced\nsignificant declines.\nIn July 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo reached out to Andy MacMillan, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, and suggested a meeting to explore the potential for an acquisition of us by Thoma Bravo.\nOn August 19, 2022, Mr. MacMillan and Jon Pexton, our Chief Financial Officer, met with representatives\nof Thoma Bravo, including A.J. Rohde, Senior Partner at Thoma Bravo, and David Tse, Vice President at\nThoma Bravo, to learn more about our company and to explore the potential for an acquisition of us by\nThoma Bravo (the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d). At this meeting, the senior representative of Thoma Bravo\ninformed Messrs. MacMillan and Pexton that Thoma Bravo was evaluating making a proposal for a potential\nacquisition of us at a price of between $9.00 and $11.00 per share, representing a premium of approximately\n84% to 125% over our closing stock price of $4.88 on August 18, 2022, subject to customary due diligence,\nand that following the consummation of a transaction, Thoma Bravo would expect to integrate our business\nwith that of its portfolio company UserZoom. At this meeting, Thoma Bravo also discussed the possibility of\nMr. MacMillan serving as the chief executive officer of the combined companies. However, as of the date of\nthis proxy statement, Thoma Bravo and Mr. MacMillan have not discussed specific terms for Mr. MacMillan\nto act in such capacity.\nOn August 26, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton and Mona Sabet, our Chief Corporate\nStrategy Officer, and representatives of Fenwick & West LLP, our outside corporate counsel (\u201cFenwick &\nWest\u201d), were present. Mr. MacMillan informed the Board of the discussions with Thoma Bravo, including his\nanticipated role following the consummation of a transaction. At the meeting, representatives of Fenwick &\nWest reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties in connection with a potential business combination\ntransaction and considerations with respect to a process for such a transaction. Mr. Pexton then discussed\nour anticipated financial results as an independent company. In light of the discussions with Thoma Bravo,\nthe Board determined to retain financial advisors, and directed our senior management to contact Morgan\nStanley and another investment bank that specializes in mergers and acquisitions, which we refer to as\n\u201cAdvisor A,\u201d for that purpose, based on both of these banks\u2019 experience with acquisition transactions in our\nindustry and, specifically in the case of Morgan Stanley, their experience with our company (as they had\nserved as a lead underwriter in our initial public offering), and in advising companies in acquisition\ntransactions with Thoma Bravo.\nOn August 29, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of\nFenwick & West and Advisor A were present. At the meeting, representatives of Advisor A presented to the\nBoard with respect to the Proposed Transaction, including Advisor A\u2019s credentials, the current market\nenvironment, perspectives on our financial performance and trading price, and process objectives and\nconsiderations.\nOn August 30, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of\nFenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nthe Board discussed the Proposed Transaction, including Morgan Stanley\u2019s credentials, our positioning in\nthe market, perspectives on our financial performance and trading price, and potential parties that might be\n31 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninterested in, and capable of, completing an acquisition of us. Morgan Stanley reviewed possible next steps\nwith respect to the Proposed Transaction for the Board to consider. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then\nleft the meeting and the Board discussed the Proposed Transaction and the presentations by Advisor A and\nMorgan Stanley. The Board then determined to engage Morgan Stanley as our financial advisor in\nconnection with the Proposed Transaction because of, among other things, Morgan Stanley\u2019s familiarity with\nour business based on its existing relationship with us, its qualifications, expertise and reputation, extensive\nexpertise and experience with transactions in our industry, and its prior experience negotiating numerous\ntransactions with Thoma Bravo. The Board then discussed the potential process for, and Board oversight\nand management of, the Proposed Transaction, including the formation of a strategic review committee of the\nBoard to manage and oversee the Proposed Transaction (the \u201cTransaction Committee\u201d). The Board\nestablished the Transaction Committee, composed of Shannon Nash, Cynthia Russo and Alexander Wong, to\nconsider, oversee, manage and direct the process for a Proposed Transaction. The Board then directed our\nmanagement to coordinate a response to Thoma Bravo with representatives of Morgan Stanley, and to\ninform Thoma Bravo that it should provide a written indication of interest with a specific price and that such\nprice should be in the upper half of the range of the verbal proposal provided by the senior representative of\nThoma Bravo on August 19, 2022.\nOn September 2, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo to convey the message from the Board. Representatives of Thoma Bravo\nindicated that they would continue to consider valuation.\nOn September 6, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting at which the other members of the\nBoard, Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At\nthe meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the discussion that had occurred with Thoma\nBravo on September 2, 2022. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then left the meeting and Mr. Pexton\nreviewed a financial forecast for 2023 through 2025 (the \u201cSeptember Financial Forecast\u201d), a copy of which\nhad been provided to the Board for review prior to the meeting. The Transaction Committee then discussed\nthe Proposed Transaction, including the update provided by Morgan Stanley, and the September Financial\nForecast. Ms. Sabet and representatives of Fenwick & West reviewed the terms set forth in a proposed\nengagement letter with Morgan Stanley. The Transaction Committee then discussed the possibility of\ncontacting other parties that might potentially be interested in, and capable of, completing an acquisition of\nus, the potential risks of such a process, the potential adverse consequences of information regarding the\nProposed Transaction if it were to become publicly known at this time, including the increased risk that a\nbroad outreach would become publicly known, which could disrupt our business, and the possibility of\ncontacting other potential acquirors through a \u201cgo shop\u201d process following an announcement of the\nPotential Transaction.\nOn September 8, 2022, Thoma Bravo and UserZoom jointly submitted a non-binding indication of\ninterest to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $9.50 per share in an all-cash\ntransaction (the \u201cSeptember 8 Proposal\u201d), subject to customary due diligence and representing a premium of\napproximately 137% over our closing stock price of $4.01 on September 7, 2022. The September 8 Proposal\ncontemplated a 30-day exclusivity period during which we could not solicit alternative proposals prior to\nexecution of a merger agreement and that we would not engage in a \u201cgo-shop\u201d process following execution\nof a merger agreement (subject to a \u201cfiduciary out\u201d with respect to unsolicited proposals). We provided a\ncopy of the September 8 Proposal to the members of the Board later that day.\nLater on September 8, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting at which Messrs. MacMillan and\nPexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting,\nMr. MacMillan and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the September 8 Proposal, and the\nTransaction Committee discussed potential responses to the September 8 Proposal.\nOn September 10, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of\nFenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley\nreviewed certain financial aspects of the September 8 Proposal and provided an overview of our financial and\nstock performance since our initial public offering and its views on the current market environment. The\nBoard discussed with representatives of Morgan Stanley preliminary perspectives on our proposed\nvaluation, and discussed our prospects as an independent company. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nthe Board then discussed the September 8 Proposal, views on strategic parties and other private equity\nsponsors\n32 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat might be interested in evaluating, and capable of completing, a potential business combination\ntransaction with us, and our response to the September 8 Proposal. The representatives from Morgan\nStanley then left the meeting and the Board discussed the terms of the proposed engagement letter between\nUserTesting and Morgan Stanley, and directed us to execute the engagement letter. A representative of\nFenwick & West then reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties in connection with a response to Thoma\nBravo. The Board then further discussed the response to the September 8 Proposal and determined to\nrespond to Thoma Bravo that we were interested in discussing a transaction but instructed our management\nto seek to obtain a higher price per share from Thoma Bravo.\nFollowing this meeting, on September 10, 2022, we executed the engagement letter with Morgan Stanley\non the terms approved by the Board.\nOn September 12, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with a\nsenior representative of Thoma Bravo and informed him that we were interested in discussing a transaction\nbut pressed Thoma Bravo to increase its proposed price per share consistent with the guidance previously\nprovided by the Board. The senior representative of Thoma Bravo indicated that they would continue to\nevaluate its proposed price per share.\nOn September 14, 2022, Thoma Bravo and UserZoom submitted a revised non-binding indication of\ninterest to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $10.00 per share (the \u201cSeptember 14\nProposal\u201d), subject to customary due diligence and representing a premium of approximately 151% over our\nclosing stock price of $3.98 on September 14, 2022. Similar to the September 8 Proposal, the September 14\nProposal contemplated a 30-day exclusivity period during which we could not solicit alternative proposals\nprior to execution of a merger agreement and that we would not engage in a \u201cgo-shop\u201d process following\nexecution of a merger agreement (subject to a \u201cfiduciary out\u201d with respect to unsolicited proposals). We\nprovided a copy of the September 14 Proposal to the members of the Board later that day.\nOn September 16, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of\nFenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley\nreviewed with the Board certain financial aspects of the September 14 Proposal and provided an update with\nrespect to the discussions that Morgan Stanley had with Thoma Bravo since September 10, 2022. The Board\nthen discussed with representatives of Morgan Stanley preliminary perspectives on our valuation, and the\nBoard and representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed strategic parties and other private equity sponsors\nthat might potentially be interested in evaluating, and capable of completing, a potential business\ncombination transaction with us, including potential strategies for soliciting proposals from such parties,\neither prior to execution of a merger agreement or through a go-shop process following execution of a merger\nagreement, and our proposed response to the September 14 Proposal. The representatives of Morgan\nStanley left the meeting, and the Board continued to discuss the response to the September 14 Proposal.\nDuring this discussion, a representative of Fenwick & West reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties in\nconnection with a response to Thoma Bravo and in evaluating a process to solicit interest in a transaction\nfrom other parties. Following this discussion, the Board determined to direct Morgan Stanley to inform\nThoma Bravo that we were willing to proceed to due diligence, and negotiation of a merger agreement, based\non the September 14 Proposal, but would not agree to any exclusivity period during which we could not\nsolicit alternative bids prior to execution of a merger agreement, and would require that any merger agreement\nprovide for a 45-day go shop period in which we could solicit proposals from other parties following\nexecution of a merger agreement. In addition, the Board determined to direct Morgan Stanley to contact a\nfinancial sponsor with existing investments in our industry and a strategic party, which we refer to herein as\n\u201cParty A\u201d and \u201cParty B,\u201d respectively, to discuss their interest in discussing an acquisition of us, as the\nBoard believed that Party A and Party B were most likely to be interested in evaluating, and capable of\ncompleting, such a transaction at an attractive valuation. These two parties were among those previously\ncontacted regarding a potential acquisition of us in the third quarter of 2021 prior to our initial public\noffering. The Board discussed the desirability of contacting other parties at this time in addition to these two\nparties, and determined not to do so, and instead to solicit interest from other parties through a go-shop\nprocess following execution of any definitive agreement providing for an acquisition of us, in view of the\nincreased risk that a broad outreach would become publicly known, which could disrupt our business.\nOn September 18, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with a\nsenior representative of Thoma Bravo and informed him that, based on the September 14 Proposal, we were\n33 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwilling to allow Thoma Bravo to conduct due diligence, and begin negotiation of a merger agreement but that\nwe would not agree to any exclusivity period and would require a 45-day go shop period. The senior\nrepresentative of Thoma Bravo indicated that Thoma Bravo was willing to proceed without exclusivity and\nwould provide for a go shop period, the length of which would need to be determined in connection with\nnegotiating the definitive agreement.\nOn September 19, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Thoma Bravo\nand discussed the anticipated due diligence process for the Proposed Transaction, including the need to\nrestrict UserZoom\u2019s access to competitive information.\nOn September 19, 2022, a representative of Fenwick & West spoke with a representative of Kirkland &\nEllis LLP (\u201cKirkland & Ellis\u201d), outside counsel to Thoma Bravo, regarding the process for drafting a merger\nagreement.\nOn September 20, 2022, we entered into a letter agreement regarding confidentially (the \u201cConfidentiality\nAgreement\u201d) with Thoma Bravo. The Confidentiality Agreement included a customary standstill provision\nthat did not include a so-called \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provision and was subject to a customary \u201cfall-\naway\u201d provision under which it would terminate if we were to enter into a merger agreement with a third party\nproviding for a change of control transaction of our company. In addition, the Confidentiality Agreement\nrestricted the ability of Thoma Bravo to disclose our confidential information to UserZoom.\nFollowing execution of the Confidentiality Agreement, on September 20, 2022, Messrs. MacMillian and\nPexton and Ms. Sabet met with representatives of Thoma Bravo and Sunstone Partners to provide a\nmanagement presentation and answer questions regarding our business, customers, strategy, financial\nresults and the September Financial Forecast, with representatives of Morgan Stanley in attendance. A copy\nof the September Financial Forecast that was presented at this meeting was subsequently provided to Thoma\nBravo and its advisors.\nLater on September 20, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted\nParty A and Party B, respectively, to determine whether they would be interested in discussing a potential\nacquisition of our company.\nLater on September 20, 2022, a representative of Party A informed representatives of Morgan Stanley\nthat Party A was not currently interested in discussing an acquisition of us. On the same day, Party B\ninformed representatives of Morgan Stanley that it would consider whether it was interested in engaging in\nany such discussions, and would respond at a later date once it had made such a determination.\nOn September 21, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of\nFenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, representatives of Fenwick & West\ndescribed the proposed terms of a draft Merger Agreement to be delivered to Thoma Bravo, including the\nproposed transaction structure, treatment of unvested stock options and RSUs, closing conditions, potential\nremedies for the failure of Thoma Bravo to close the Proposed Transaction, provision for a 45-day \u201cgo-shop\u201d\nprocess and termination fees payable in the event of a superior proposal from a third party. Representatives\nof Morgan Stanley then provided an update on discussions with Thoma Bravo since the September 16, 2022\nBoard meeting. Representatives of Morgan Stanley informed the Board that Thoma Bravo had verbally\nagreed that we would not be subject to an exclusivity period prior to signing of the Merger Agreement,\nwhich would permit us to solicit alternative bids prior to signing of the Merger Agreement, and would permit\nthe inclusion of a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in the Merger Agreement, which would enable us to solicit alternative\nbids after signing of the Merger Agreement for a period of time. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then\ninformed the Board that Party A was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of us and that Party B had\nindicated that it would consider whether it was interested in engaging in any such discussions, and that it\nwould respond at a later date once it had made such a determination.\nOn September 22, 2022, Thoma Bravo and its advisors were provided with access to a virtual data room\nwith diligence information regarding our company.\nOn September 23, 2022, representatives of Fenwick & West sent an initial draft of a clean team\nconfidentiality agreement that had been prepared by Fenwick & West to representatives of Kirkland & Ellis\nto apply to certain competitive information that had not yet been provided in the virtual data room, and\n34 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\non September 25, 2022, we and Thoma Bravo executed the clean team agreement. On September 25, 2022,\npursuant to the clean team agreement, certain representatives of Thoma Bravo and representatives of\nKirkland & Ellis and other advisors to Thoma Bravo were provided with access to a clean team specific\nvirtual data room with sensitive diligence information regarding our company.\nLater on September 23, 2022, representatives of Fenwick & West sent an initial draft of the Merger\nAgreement that had been prepared by Fenwick & West to representatives of Kirkland & Ellis. The initial draft\nMerger Agreement provided for (i) a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in the Merger Agreement that would enable us to\nsolicit alternative bids for 45 days after signing, that had been previously agreed by the parties, (ii) Thoma\nBravo to pay us a reverse termination fee of 5.4% of the equity value, including if the Proposed Transaction\ncannot close because of a failure to obtain necessary antitrust approvals or clearances, (iii) us to pay Thoma\nBravo a termination fee of 2.7% of the equity value under certain circumstances (0.9% with respect to a\nproposal made during the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period) and (iv) a portion of the unvested stock options and RSUs held\nby employees be accelerated in the event that they were terminated without cause, or for \u201cgood reason\u201d.\nLater on September 23, 2022, a representative of Party B informed representatives of Morgan Stanley\nthat Party B would not be making a proposal to acquire us.\nOn September 25, 2022, Morgan Stanley provided us with a customary disclosure document describing\ncertain relationships between Morgan Stanley and representatives thereof on the one hand and UserTesting\nand Thoma Bravo, and their respective affiliates, on the other hand. This disclosure document indicated,\namong other matters, that Morgan Stanley or an affiliate thereof was a lender to certain portfolio companies\nof Thoma Bravo, and acted as administrative agent with respect to credit facilities of two such portfolio\ncompanies, including UserZoom. We provided a copy of this disclosure document to the Board on\nSeptember 26, 2022.\nBetween September 26, 2022 and October 3, 2022, members of our management conducted several\nmeetings with representatives of Thoma Bravo at which members of our management provided due diligence\npresentations and answered questions. Representatives of Fenwick & West and Kirkland & Ellis were in\nattendance for the meetings with respect to legal matters.\nOn September 28, Mr. MacMillan met with representatives of Thoma Bravo and Sunstone Partners to\nbecome better acquainted and to discuss our company.\nOn September 30, 2022, representatives of Fenwick & West and representatives of Kirkland & Ellis\ndiscussed the initial draft of the Merger Agreement. During this meeting, the representatives of Kirkland &\nEllis (i) proposed a \u201cgo-shop\u201d period of 30 days, (ii) rejected our proposal that Thoma Bravo pay us a reverse\ntermination fee if the Proposed Transaction cannot close because of a failure to obtain necessary antitrust\napprovals or clearances, (iii) proposed that we pay Thoma Bravo a termination fee of 3.0% of the equity if the\nMerger Agreement was terminated under certain circumstances (1.5% with respect to a proposal made during\nthe \u201cgo-shop\u201d period), and (iv) rejected our proposal that a portion of the unvested stock options and RSUs\nheld by employees be accelerated in the event that they were terminated without cause, or for \u201cgood\nreason.\u201d\nLater on September 30, 2022, Messrs. MacMillan, Pexton, Satterwhite and Doktorczky and Mses. Sabet\nand Mekhalfa, met with representatives of Thoma Bravo and discussed our anticipated third quarter financial\nresults, with representatives of Morgan Stanley and Ernst & Young in attendance. These anticipated results\nincluded revenue and calculated billings (total revenue plus the change in contract liabilities from the\nbeginning to the end of the period, a non-GAAP financial measure that is indicative of amounts invoiced to\ncustomers) that were lower than those anticipated by Wall Street analysts, Thoma Bravo and the September\nFinancial Forecast.\nOn October 3, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted representatives of Morgan\nStanley and informed them that, as a result of our third quarter financial results (and in particular, our\ncalculated billings for the quarter), trends in our end markets and the increased cost to Thoma Bravo to\nsecure debt financing for the Proposed Transaction in light of current debt market conditions, Thoma Bravo\nwas no longer willing to proceed at the previously proposed price of $10.00 per share but did not indicate a\nprice per share at which Thoma Bravo was willing to proceed.\n35 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFollowing that call, on October 3, 2022, as a result of Thoma Bravo\u2019s indication that it would be reducing\nthe valuation, we instructed our advisors to cease engaging with Thoma Bravo\u2019s advisors.\nOn October 4, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nverbally indicted that Thoma Bravo may be prepared to resume discussions at a price of $7.50 per share,\nsubject to further due diligence regarding our financial outlook and our go-to-market strategy (the \u201cOctober\n4 Proposal\u201d). The October 4 Proposal represented a premium of approximately 95% over our closing stock\nprice of $3.84 on October 3, 2022.\nFollowing that call, on October 4, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and\nrepresentatives of Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, Mr. MacMillan and\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the October 4 Proposal, including the rationales conveyed by\nThoma Bravo for the price decrease. Messrs. MacMillan and Pexton provided the Board an update on our\nfinancial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. A representative of Fenwick & West then\nreviewed the fiduciary duties of the Board in considering the October 4 Proposal. Following discussion, the\nBoard directed representatives of Morgan Stanley and our management to reject the October 4 Proposal\nbecause of the magnitude of the price decrease and the lack of certainty and specificity in the October 4\nProposal.\nLater on October 4, 2022, a representative of Morgan Stanley contacted a senior representative of\nThoma Bravo and informed him that the Board had rejected the October 4 Proposal.\nLater on October 4, 2022, the same senior representative of Thoma Bravo then contacted Mr. MacMillan\nto reiterate Thoma Bravo\u2019s rationale for its revised view of valuation.\nOn October 5, 2022, as a result of the Board\u2019s determination, we terminated the engagement letter with\nMorgan Stanley and also terminated the access of Thoma Bravo and its advisors to the virtual data room.\nOn October 9, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. MacMillan and verbally indicated\nthat it was evaluating its ability to proceed at a price of $7.50 per share, subject to further due diligence\nregarding our financial outlook and our go-to-market strategy. Mr. MacMillan responded that, in light of the\nBoard\u2019s previous direction regarding the October 4 Proposal, any proposal would need to provide us with\nsubstantially greater certainty and specificity, and not be subject to any further due diligence that could\naffect valuation.\nOn October 12, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. MacMillan and verbally indicated\nthat it would likely be willing to proceed at a price of $7.00 per share given market conditions, which\nrepresented a premium of approximately 89% over our closing stock price of $3.71 on October 11, 2022. Mr.\nMacMillan responded that the proposal to proceed at a price of $7.00 per share was insufficient and the\nproposal did not provide us with the level of certainty and specificity that was necessary. Mr. MacMillan\nnoted that, at the October 4, 2022 Board Meeting, the Board was not supportive of $7.50 per share without\ngreater certainty and specificity.\nOn October 13, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. MacMillan and verbally indicated\nthat Thoma Bravo would be willing to proceed at a price of $7.25 per share, which represented a premium of\napproximately 94% over our closing stock price of $3.74 on October 12, 2022, subject to further due diligence\nregarding our financial outlook. Mr. MacMillan responded that he did not anticipate the Board would\nsupport a transaction at a price of $7.25 per share, especially in view of the continued lack of certainty and\nspecificity as to terms and due diligence requirements, but that, nevertheless, he would communicate the\nproposal to the Board. Later that day, Mr. MacMillan communicated this proposal to the Board.\nOn October 16, 2022, we sent a letter to Thoma Bravo requesting that Thoma Bravo and its advisors\nreturn to us, or destroy, all confidential information that had been provided to them pursuant to the\nConfidentiality Agreement.\nOn October 20, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. MacMillan and verbally indicated\nthat Thoma Bravo would be willing to proceed at a price of $7.50 per share and that it had generally\ncompleted their due diligence on us (other than confirmatory legal due diligence), to which Mr. MacMillan\nresponded that Thoma Bravo should put the offer in writing and provide along with any proposed\n36 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsignificant changes to the draft Merger Agreement so that the Board could fully evaluate the terms being\nproposed and the certainty of the Proposed Transaction.\nOn October 20, 2022, Thoma Bravo and UserZoom submitted a further revised non-binding indication of\ninterest to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $7.50 per share (the \u201cOctober 20\nProposal\u201d), representing a premium of approximately 112% over our closing stock price of $3.54 on October\n20, 2022, and a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. Among other terms reflected in the draft Merger\nAgreement, the Merger Agreement (i) included a \u201cgo-shop\u201d period of 45 days, which was unchanged from\nthe initial draft Merger Agreement that Fenwick & West sent to Kirkland & Ellis, (ii) rejected our proposal\nthat Thoma Bravo pay us a reverse termination fee if the Proposed Transaction cannot close because of a\nfailure to obtain necessary antitrust approvals or clearances, (iii) proposed that we pay Thoma Bravo a\ntermination fee of 2.7% of the equity under certain circumstances (0.9% with respect to a proposal made\nduring the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period), which was unchanged from the initial draft Merger Agreement that Fenwick &\nWest sent to Kirkland & Ellis and (iv) rejected our proposal that a portion of the unvested stock options and\nRSUs held by employees be accelerated in the event that they were terminated without cause, or for \u201cgood\nreason.\u201d\nLater on October 20, 2022, our management contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss the\nOctober 20 Proposal and next steps, and determined to engage in further discussions with Thoma Bravo to\nconfirm that Thoma Bravo was firm on price and that Thoma Bravo did not require additional due diligence\nthat could be expected to affect their valuation, and determined that upon such confirmation from Thoma\nBravo, we would review the October 20 Proposal with the Board.\nOn October 21, 2022, at the direction of our management, representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed\nthe Proposed Transaction with representatives of Thoma Bravo, including Thoma Bravo\u2019s plan to commit\nequity capital to fund the entire cash consideration payable at closing under the Merger Agreement and that\nThoma Bravo would potentially seek debt financing for a portion of the purchase price following the signing\nof the Merger Agreement. During such discussion and at the direction of our management, representatives\nof Morgan Stanley also noted that we had updated the September Financial Forecast to reflect our third\nquarter financial performance, and estimates for the fourth quarter. In addition, representatives of Morgan\nStanley mentioned that the Board would review the October 20 Proposal after Thoma Bravo confirmed it was\nnow firm on price and that no additional diligence items were needed for Thoma Bravo to complete its\nvaluation diligence. Representatives of Thoma Bravo replied that they needed to see our revenue and billing\nresults for the third quarter along with current revenue and billings estimates for the fourth quarter, and a\ncurrent fully-diluted share calculation.\nLater on October 21, 2022, at the direction of our management, representatives of Fenwick & West sent a\nrevised draft of the Merger Agreement, and an initial draft of our related disclosure letter to representatives\nof Kirkland & Ellis.\nOn October 22, 2022, we provided representatives of Thoma Bravo with our revenue and billing results\nfor the third quarter along with current revenue and billings estimates for the fourth quarter and a current\nfully-diluted share calculation and, after reviewing this information, Thoma Bravo confirmed to\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley the $7.50 per share price included in the October 20 Proposal and that no\nadditional due diligence that could be expected to affect their valuation remained outstanding.\nLater on October 22, 2022, representatives of Fenwick & West and Kirkland & Ellis discussed the\nrevised draft of the Merger Agreement, and between October 23, 2022 and October 26, 2022, representatives\nof Fenwick & West and Kirkland & Ellis exchanged revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and our\ndisclosure letter and conducted a number of conference calls regarding the draft Merger Agreement. Among\nother items in the draft Merger Agreement, the parties negotiated exceptions to the interim operating\ncovenants regarding actions that we could take following the execution of the Merger Agreement.\nLater on October 22, 2022, Morgan Stanley provided us with an updated customary disclosure\ndocument describing certain relationships between Morgan Stanley and representatives thereof on the one\nhand and UserTesting and Thoma Bravo, and their respective affiliates, on the other hand, which reiterated\nthe relationships identified in the disclosure document previously provided to us. We provided a copy of\nthis disclosure document to the Board on October 23, 2022.\n37 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn October 23, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of\nFenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, Mr. MacMillan and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the October 20 Proposal and the status of the Proposed Transaction, including\nthat Thoma Bravo had confirmed the price included in the October 20 Proposal and that no additional\nvaluation diligence remained outstanding. Mr. Pexton then presented the updated long-term financial\nforecast that was developed by our management over the course of October, a copy of which had been\nprovided to the Board for review prior to the meeting, for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through\n2025 with certain extrapolations prepared by Morgan Stanley for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2026\nthrough 2036 with the guidance of our management (the \u201cOctober Financial Forecast\u201d) that reflected the\npotential impact of our financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022 on future periods, and\nwhich reflected reduced levels of revenue, gross margin, EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow as compared\nto the September Financial Forecast as a result of our revenue and billing results for the third quarter and\nestimates for the fourth quarter and trends in our end markets that we observed subsequent to our\npreparation of the September 21 forecast. The October Financial Forecast is described in more detail in the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201c- Management Projections\u201d. A representative of Fenwick & West\nthen described the status of negotiations of the Merger Agreement. The Board then discussed the October\n20 Proposal in light of the October Financial Forecast and these trends in our end markets, and the risks to\nour business of current increased economic and market uncertainty, and directed our senior management to\ncontinue to work with Thoma Bravo to complete negotiations on the basis of the October 20 Proposal.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley left the meeting. The Board and a representative of Fenwick & West then\ndiscussed the updated relationship disclosure that had been provided by Morgan Stanley, and the Board\ndetermined to re-engage Morgan Stanley and we subsequently executed an addendum to the engagement\nletter with Morgan Stanley on October 24, 2022 to reinstate the terms of such engagement letter. The Board\nthen approved the use of the October Financial Forecast by Morgan Stanley in its financial analyses of the\nProposed Transaction.\nLater on October 23, 2022, representatives of Kirkland & Ellis sent to representatives of Fenwick & West\ninitial drafts of each of the Equity Commitment Letters and Guaranties to be entered into by the Thoma Bravo\nFunds and by the Sunstone Partners Funds concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement. From\nOctober 24, 2022 through October 26, 2022, representatives from Fenwick & West and Kirkland & Ellis\nnegotiated the Equity Commitment Letters and Guaranties.\nOn October 25, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of\nFenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, Mr. MacMillan, Ms. Sabet and Morgan\nStanley provided an update on the discussions with Thoma Bravo and Fenwick & West then led a\ndiscussion regarding material terms of the Merger Agreement and certain open issues, including the\nrestrictions on the operation of our business following execution of the Merger Agreement.\nOn October 26, 2022, representatives of Kirkland & Ellis and representatives of Fenwick & West\ncompleted their negotiation of the Merger Agreement, Equity Commitment Letters and Guaranties.\nOn October 26, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Mses. Sabet and Huff and\nrepresentatives of Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. Representatives of Morgan Stanley\ndelivered to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion\ndated October 26, 2022, to the effect that, as of October 26, 2022, and based upon and subject to the\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope\nof review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the per share consideration of\n$7.50 in cash to be received by the holders of shares of our common stock (other than holders of the\nExcluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders\nof shares of our common stock. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201c- Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.\u201d Representatives of Fenwick & West\nreviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties and summarized the key terms of the transaction, including the\noutcome of the negotiations with respect to the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision and the restrictions on the operation of\nour business following execution of the Merger Agreement. Following discussion and consideration of the\nMerger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the factors\ndescribed in the section titled \u201c- Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board\u201d), the members of\nthe Board unanimously (i) determined that it was in the best interests of us and our\n38",

You are encouraged to read Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion\nwas directed to the Board of Directors, in its capacity as such, and addresses only the fairness from a financial point of\nview of the $7.50 per share in cash to be received by the holders of shares of UserTesting common stock (other than\nthe holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion and does not\naddress the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other\nalternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not,\nconstitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how UserTesting stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.\nThe summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of\nthe opinion.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:\nreviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information\nof UserTesting\u037e\nreviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning\nUserTesting\u037e\nreviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of UserTesting and certain\nextrapolations prepared with guidance from the management of UserTesting (which were reviewed\nand approved by the Board of Directors for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use)\u037e\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of UserTesting\nwith senior executives of UserTesting\u037e\nreviewed the reported prices and trading activity for UserTesting common stock\u037e\ncompared the financial performance of UserTesting and the prices and trading activity of UserTesting\ncommon stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with UserTesting, and\ntheir securities\u037e\nreviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition\ntransactions\u037e\nparticipated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of UserTesting, Parent\nand their legal advisors\u037e\nreviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated as of October 26, 2022, drafts of each of the Equity\nCommitment Letters and the Guaranties, in each case substantially in the form of the drafts dated\nOctober 26, 2022, and certain related documents\u037e and\nperformed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors\nas Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification,\nthe accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made\navailable to Morgan Stanley by UserTesting, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to\nthe October Financial Forecast, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases\nreflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of UserTesting\u2019s management of the future\nfinancial performance of UserTesting. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to such financial projections or\nthe assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger would be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver,\namendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including among other things, that Parent will obtain\nfinancing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters, and that the definitive\nmerger agreement and Equity Commitment Letters would not differ in any material respect from the drafts\nthereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the\nnecessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no\ndelays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on\nthe contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger.

Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to\nthe fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of UserTesting\u2019s officers, directors or\nemployees, or any class of such persons, relative to the $7.50 per share in cash to be received by the holders\nof shares of UserTesting common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the Merger.\nMorgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of\nUserTesting, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to Morgan Stanley as of, October 26, 2022. Events occurring after October 26,\n2022 may affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did\nnot assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection\nwith its oral opinion as of October 26, 2022, subsequently confirmed in writing as of such date, to the Board\nof Directors. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion or the\nfinancial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor\ndoes the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses.\nSome of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to\nfully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the\ntext of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.\nThe analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any\nportion of such analyses and the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could\ncreate a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley\nutilized and was directed by the Board of Directors to rely upon, among other matters, (i) the October\nFinancial Forecast, which included extrapolations through calendar year 2036 prepared by Morgan Stanley\nthat were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by the Board of Directors, and (ii) certain\nestimates of equity research analysts available as of October 26, 2022, which included extrapolations through\ncalendar year 2025 prepared by Morgan Stanley (the \u201cStreet Consensus\u201d). The October Financial Forecast\nare more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c- Projections.\u201d In\naccordance with direction from the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley utilized the Street Consensus and the\nOctober Financial Forecast in its financial analyses described below.\nPublic Trading Comparables Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied\nvalue of a company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed\nand compared certain financial estimates for UserTesting with comparable publicly available consensus\nequity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment\nand experience, that share similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating\ncharacteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market\ncapitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred\nto as the \u201ccomparable companies\u201d). These comparable companies are identified below.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to estimated\nrevenue for each of the comparable companies utilizing publicly available financial information from\nconsensus equity analyst research estimates for calendar year 2023 (which ratio is referred to herein as\n\u201cAV/CY2023E Revenue Multiple\u201d). For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined \u201caggregate value\u201d\nas a company\u2019s fully diluted equity value plus total debt, less cash and cash equivalents.\nThe range of observed AV/CY2023E Revenue Multiples for the selected customer experience comparable\ncompanies was 2.7x to 6.0x, with a median observed multiple of 4.8x, and for the selected software financial\n44 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncomparable companies was 1.3x to 4.8x, with a median observed multiple of 2.5x. The following is a list of the\nselected comparable companies reviewed, together with the applicable multiples:\nSelected Comparable Company\nAV/\nCY2023E \nRevenue \nMultiple\nSelected Customer Experience Comparable Companies\nAmplitude, Inc.\n6.0x\nBraze, Inc.\n5.6x\nQualtrics International Inc.\n4.0x\nSprinklr, Inc.\n2.7x\nSelected Software Financial Comparable Companies\nBigCommerce Holdings, Inc.\n3.2x\nCS Disco, Inc.\n2.5x\nCouchbase, Inc.\n2.6x\nSemrush Holdings, Inc.\n4.8x\nSumo Logic, Inc.\n1.9x\nWalkMe Ltd.\n1.3x\nBased on an analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the\napplication of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected a representative range of\nAV/CY2023E Revenue Multiples of 2.0x\u202f-\u202f4.0x and applied this range of multiples to the estimated revenue for\nUserTesting for calendar year 2023 based on the Street Consensus. In addition, for the purpose of this\nanalysis, Morgan Stanley calculated UserTesting\u2019s aggregate value assuming UserTesting\u2019s net cash as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 as provided by UserTesting\u2019s management. Based on the calculations set forth above\nand the outstanding shares of UserTesting common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by\nUserTesting management on October 25, 2022, this analysis implied an estimated value per share of\nUserTesting common stock of $3.80 to $6.46.\nNo company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to UserTesting. In\nevaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,\nmany of which are beyond UserTesting\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of\ncompetition on UserTesting\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any\nadverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of UserTesting and the industry, and in the\nfinancial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in\nitself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight\ninto a theoretical estimate of the potential future equity value of a company as a function of such company\u2019s\nestimated future revenue. The resulting estimated future equity value is subsequently discounted back to\nthe present day to arrive at an illustrative estimate of the implied present value for the company\u2019s common\nstock. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values\nper share of UserTesting common stock on a standalone basis for each of the Street Consensus and October\nFinancial Forecast.\nTo calculate the discounted equity value per share of UserTesting common stock, Morgan Stanley used\ncalendar year 2025 estimated revenue of approximately $335 million based on the Street Consensus and\napproximately $348 million based on the October Financial Forecast. For each scenario, Morgan Stanley\ncalculated the future-implied aggregate value of UserTesting as of December 31, 2024 by applying its public\ntrading comparables analysis reference range for AV/CY2023E Revenue Multiples of 2.0x\u202f-\u202f4.0x to\nUserTesting\u2019s calendar year 2025 estimated revenue based on each of the Street Consensus and the October\n45 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFinancial Forecast. In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided the future-implied aggregate value by\nestimated future diluted shares outstanding (with such estimates provided by UserTesting\u2019s management) to\ncalculate a future implied equity value per share. Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting future\nimplied equity values per share to December 31, 2022 using a discount rate equal to UserTesting\u2019s assumed\ncost of equity of 13.5 percent, which cost of equity was selected based on the application of Morgan\nStanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. Based on these calculations, this analysis implied the\nfollowing value ranges per share of UserTesting\u2019s common stock:\nForecast Scenario\nImplied Value Per Share\nRange of \nUserTesting Common \nStock ($)\nStreet Consensus\n3.84\u202f-\u202f7.15\nOctober Financial Forecast\n4.08\u202f-\u202f7.51\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied\nvalue of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of\nsuch company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for UserTesting\ncommon stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value UserTesting as a standalone entity.\nMorgan Stanley utilized estimates from the October Financial Forecast for purposes of its discounted cash\nflow analysis, as more fully described below.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as non-GAAP\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (burdened by stock based compensation), less\ntaxes and capital expenditures, and adjusted for changes in net working capital (excluding deferred revenue)\nand deferred revenue. To calculate terminal value, Morgan Stanley applied a range of perpetual growth rates\nof 3.0 percent to 4.0 percent, based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment. Morgan Stanley then\ndiscounted the unlevered free cash flows and terminal value to present values as of December 31, 2022 using\na range of discount rates from 12.5% to 14.5%, which discount rates were selected based on the application\nof Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of UserTesting\u2019s weighted\naverage cost of capital. The resulting aggregate value was then adjusted to add net cash and further\nadjusted to add the net present value of net operating losses.\nBased on the outstanding shares of UserTesting common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by\nUserTesting\u2019s management on October 25, 2022, this analysis implied an estimated value per share of\nUserTesting common stock of $3.59 to $5.17.\nPrecedent Transactions Multiples Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a\nvalue of a company based on publicly available financial terms, by reviewing publicly available statistics for\nselected comparable transactions. Such comparable transactions included certain software transactions\nsince 2018 that were selected because they shared certain characteristics with the Merger, as determined\nbased on the application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. For each such\ntransaction, Morgan Stanley noted the aggregate value of the transaction as a multiple of the estimated\nrevenue of the target company for the twelve month period following the announcement date of the\napplicable transaction (which multiple is referred to herein as \u201cAV/NTM Revenue Multiple\u201d).\n46 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following is the list of the selected software transactions reviewed:\nSelected Software Transactions (Target/Acquiror)\nAnnouncement\nDate\nAV/NTM \nRevenue\nMultiple\nStrategic Acquirors\nCallidus Software Inc. / SAP America, Inc.\n2018\n8.3x\nCarbon Black, Inc. / VMware, Inc.\n2019\n8.0x\nCarbonite, Inc. / Open Text Corporation\n2019\n2.7x\nDatto, Inc. / Kaseya Limited\n2022\n8.3x\nMobileIron, Inc. / Ivanti, Inc.\n2020\n4.1x\nVMware, Inc / Broadcom Inc.\n2022\n4.7x\nFinancial Sponsor Acquirors\nApptio, Inc. / Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n2018\n7.0x\nAthenahealth, Inc. / Veritas Capital Fund Management, L.L.C.\n2018\n3.9x\nAvalara, Inc. / Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n2022\n9.1x\nCambium Learning Group, Inc. / Veritas Capital Fund Management,\nL.L.C.\n2018\n4.2x\nCDK Global, Inc. / Brookfield Business Partners L.P.\n2022\n4.5x\nCision Ltd. / Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC\n2019\n3.5x\nCitrix Systems, Inc. / Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n2022\n5.0x\nCloudera, Inc. / Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC\u037e Kohlberg Kravis Roberts\n& Co.

The results of this analysis were\nas follows:\nForecast Scenario\nImplied Value Per \nShare Range of \nUserTesting\nCommon \nStock ($)\nStreet Consensus\n7.12\u202f-\u202f11.10\nOctober Financial Forecast\n6.92\u202f-\u202f10.77\nNo company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to UserTesting or\nthe Merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with\nrespect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and\nother matters, many of which are beyond UserTesting\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the\nimpact of competition on UserTesting\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the\nabsence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of UserTesting and the\nindustry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies\nand the aggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared.\nThe fact that points in the range of implied present value per share of UserTesting derived from the valuation\nof precedent transactions were less than or greater than the $7.50 per share in cash to be received by the\nholders of shares of UserTesting common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) is not\nnecessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis of the consideration for the Merger,\nbut is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.\nOther Information\nMorgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial\nanalysis with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Board of Directors.\nIllustrative Precedent Transaction Premiums\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the premiums paid by acquirers in selected public software company\ntransactions occurring in 2022 with an aggregate value greater than $1 billion. For each such transaction,\nMorgan Stanley noted the distributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (i) the implied\npremium to the acquired company\u2019s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the\nlast full trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related\nnews)\u037e and (ii) the implied premium to the acquired company\u2019s 30-day average closing share price prior to\nannouncement (or the last full trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or\nsimilar merger-related news).\nBased on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected (i) a representative range of premia and\napplied such range to UserTesting\u2019s closing share price on October 26, 2022 and (ii) a representative range of\npremia and applied such range to UserTesting\u2019s closing share price during the 30 trading days prior to and\nincluding October 26, 2022.\nThe following table summarizes such calculations:\nPremia\nRepresentative\nRange\nImplied\nValue per \nShare Range\nof \nUserTesting \nCommon\nStock \n($)\nPremia to 1-Day Unaffected Share Price\n30%\u202f-\u202f65%\n5.02\u202f-\u202f\n6.37\nPremia to 30-day Average Unaffected Share Price\n30%\u202f-\u202f55%\n4.96\u202f-\u202f\n5.92\n48 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHistorical Trading Ranges\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the historical trading range of UserTesting common stock for various periods\nending on October 26, 2022. Morgan Stanley observed the following:\nTrading Periods\nHistorical Per Share Range\nof \nUserTesting Common\nStock ($)\nLast 30 Days ending on October 26, 2022\n3.43\u202f-\u202f4.29\nLast 90 Days ending on October 26, 2022\n3.43\u202f-\u202f6.42\nSince IPO on November 17, 2021 and ending on October 26, 2022\n3.43\u202f-\u202f14.01\nEquity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets\nMorgan Stanley reviewed certain future public market trading price targets for UserTesting common\nstock prepared and published by equity research analysts prior to October 26, 2022. These targets reflected\neach analyst\u2019s estimate of the future public market trading price of UserTesting common stock. The range of\nundiscounted analyst price targets for the UserTesting common stock was $4.50 to $9.00 per share, with a\nmedian of $8.00 per share. Morgan Stanley then discounted the range of analyst price targets per share for\nthe UserTesting common stock to December 31, 2022 at a rate of 13.5%, which was the discount rate selected\nby Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, to reflect\nUserTesting\u2019s cost of equity. This analysis indicated an implied range of fully diluted equity values for\nUserTesting common stock of $4.06 to $8.12 per share.\nThe public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect\ncurrent market trading prices for UserTesting common stock, and these estimates are subject to\nuncertainties, including the future financial performance of UserTesting and future financial market\nconditions.\nIllustrative Leveraged Buyout Analysis.\nMorgan Stanley reviewed a hypothetical leveraged buyout analysis to determine the prices at which a\nfinancial sponsor might effect a leveraged buyout of UserTesting. Morgan Stanley based its analysis on the\nOctober Financial Forecast. Based on its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley assumed (i)\na transaction date of December 31, 2022 and an investment period ending December 31, 2027, (ii) a target\nrange of annualized internal rates of return for the financial sponsor of 20% to 22.5%, (iii) a 21.4% debt-to-\ncapitalization ratio, and balance sheet cash at December 31, 2022 of $165 million as provided by\nUserTesting\u2019s management as of September 30, 2022, (iv) a range from 3.0x to 4.0x applied to the estimated\ncalendar year 2027 next twelve (12) month revenue exit multiples and (v) no synergies. Based on these\ncalculations, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity value per share of UserTesting common stock\nof $5.43 to $7.47 per share.\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a\nvariety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a\nfinancial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary\ndescription. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole\nand did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes\nthat selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an\nincomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have\ngiven various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have\ndeemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of\nvaluations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan\nStanley\u2019s view of the actual value of UserTesting. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made\nnumerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market\nand financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond UserTesting\u2019s control. These include,\namong other things, the impact of competition on UserTesting\u2019s business and the industry generally,\nindustry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of\nUserTesting and\n49 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyses\nare not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less\nfavorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness\nfrom a financial point of view of the $7.50 per share in cash to be received by the holders of shares of\nUserTesting common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of October 26, 2022 to the Board of\nDirectors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of\nUserTesting common stock might actually trade.\nThe $7.50 per share in cash to be received by the holders of shares of UserTesting common stock (other\nthan the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was determined through arm\u2019s-\nlength negotiations between UserTesting and Parent and was approved by the Board of Directors. Morgan\nStanley provided advice to the Board of Directors during these negotiations but did not, however,\nrecommend any specific consideration to UserTesting or the Board of Directors, nor did Morgan Stanley\nopine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. Morgan\nStanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative\nbusiness transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are\navailable. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a\nrecommendation as to how UserTesting stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken\ninto consideration by the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the\nanalyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board of Directors\nwith respect to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of whether the Board of Directors\nwould have been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a\ncommittee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan\nStanley\u2019s customary practice.\nThe Board of Directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications,\nexperience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities,\ninvestment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in\nsecurities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives\ntrading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services.\nMorgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage\nfunds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and\neffect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or\nloans of UserTesting, Parent, Thoma Bravo and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any\ncurrency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition,\nMorgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working with UserTesting in\nconnection with the Merger, may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private equity\nfunds managed by Thoma Bravo or its affiliates and their affiliated funds\u2019 respective portfolio companies\n(which are referred to collectively herein as the \u201cThoma Bravo Related Entities\u201d) or in affiliates of Morgan\nStanley that may hold direct equity and/or partnership interests in private equity funds managed by Thoma\nBravo or the Thoma Bravo Related Entities.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided UserTesting financial advisory\nservices and an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in\nconnection with the Merger, and UserTesting has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $20.4\nmillion for its services, $3 million of which was earned following delivery of the opinion described in this\nsection and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the\nconsummation of the Merger. UserTesting has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses,\nincluding fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its\nengagement. In addition, UserTesting has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their\nrespective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan\nStanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in\nconnection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\n50",

In connection with the evaluation of the Merger, however, our management prepared the following\npreliminary financial forecasts:\nthe October Financial Forecast, which was prepared by our management in October 2022 for the fiscal\nyears ending December 31, 2022 through 2025 and included certain extrapolations prepared by\nMorgan Stanley for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2026 through 2036 with the guidance of our\nmanagement\u037e and\nthe September Financial Forecast, which was prepared by our management in September 2022 for the\nfiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through 2025.\nThe October Financial Forecast and September Financial Forecast are referred to collectively as the\n\u201cManagement Projections\u201d.\nThe October Financial Forecast was provided to the Board in connection with its consideration of the\nMerger, and, at the direction of the Board, was used by Morgan Stanley in connection with its financial\nanalysis for purposes of its fairness opinion (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201c- Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co.

Furthermore, the\nManagement Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that\ncontext. Although the Management Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on\nnumerous variables and assumptions made by our management with respect to industry performance,\ngeneral business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as\nmatters specific to our business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of\nwhich are beyond our control. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and are\nsubject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results\nforecasted in the Management Projections, including, but not limited to, our performance, industry\nperformance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, competition, adverse\nchanges in applicable laws, regulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete\nacquisitions, and the various risks set forth in our reports filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that\nthe Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower\nthan the Management Projections. The Management Projections cover several years, and such information\nby its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. In addition, the Management Projections will\nbe affected by our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The\nManagement Projections reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and\ncannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be\nrelied on as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections should not be regarded as an indication that\nwe, Morgan Stanley, our and their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors, or other representatives\nor anyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable prediction of\nfuture events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management\nProjections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Management Projections\nwill be necessarily predictive of actual future events. No representation is made by us or any other person\nregarding the Management Projections or our ultimate performance compared to such information. The\nManagement Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements\nand other information about us contained in our public filings with the SEC. For more information, please see\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d In light of the\nforegoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, our stockholders are\ncautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.\nThe Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view\ntoward complying with the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or the guidelines established by the American Institute of\n52 \n(1)\n)\n)\n)\n(2)",

The Severance Agreements generally provide that if the executive\nofficer\u2019s employment is terminated by us without \u201ccause\u201d or the executive officer terminates his or her\nemployment with \u201cgood reason,\u201d in either case, within three (3) months prior to the Change in Control Date\nor within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control Date, then the executive officer will be eligible\nto receive:\na lump-sum cash severance amount equal to 100% of the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary\u037e\n55 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nan additional cash payment equal to a pro-rated portion of his or her annual target bonus (or the full\ntarget bonus in the case of our Chief Executive Officer)\u037e\nto the extent that the applicable executive officer elects continued coverage under COBRA, he or she\nwill also receive a further cash payment in an amount equal to his or her COBRA premiums for twelve\n(12) months plus an additional amount designed to account for the fact that such payment is made on\nan after-tax basis\u037e and\naccelerated vesting of 100% of the unvested shares subject to all outstanding equity compensation\nawards held by the executive officer immediately prior to such termination of employment, with\nperformance-based equity awards vesting based on actual achievement or, if not yet determined, then\nat 100% of target achievement.\nThe provision of payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon the executive officer\u2019s\nexecution of a release of claims. The Severance Agreement further provides that if an executive officer\nreceives any amount that is subject to the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 280G\nand 4999 of the Code, the amount of the payments to be made to the executive officer will be reduced to the\nextent such reduction would result in a greater amount of after-tax proceeds.\nVesting Acceleration\nAt the Effective Time, the Unvested Company Options pursuant to the stock option agreement granted\non June 4, 2020, by and between UserTesting and Mr. MacMillan will fully vest and accelerate and will be\nconsidered Vested Company Options.\nEquity Grants to Non-Employee Directors\nWe may grant and issue up to 22,667 Company RSUs (in addition to any Permitted Equity Grants\ngranted and issued) to our non-employee directors, on terms consistent with UserTesting\u2019s Independent\nDirector Compensation Policy, in the event the Closing has not occurred on or prior to June 1, 2023.\nCompensation Arrangements with Parent\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers have discussed or entered into\nany agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or\nparticipate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the Closing of the\nMerger, however, some or all of our executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements with Parent or\nany of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent\nor one or more of its affiliates.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, our directors and executive officers will be entitled to\ncertain ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time under\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation. This indemnification and\ninsurance coverage is further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1:\nAdoption of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fIndemnification and Insurance.\u201d\nPost-Closing Management of UserTesting and UserZoom\nIn addition, upon completion of the Merger, it is anticipated that our Chief Executive Officer and,\npotentially, other members of our management team, will serve as members of the management team of the\nSurviving Corporation. Following the closing of the transaction, Thoma Bravo and Sunstone Partners intend\nto combine UserTesting and UserZoom. As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers\nhas entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to\npurchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to and\nfollowing the closing of the Merger, however, certain of our executive officers may have discussions, and\nfollowing the closing of the Merger, may enter into agreements with, Parent or Merger\n56",

        "Appraisal Rights": {
            "text": "Appraisal Rights\nIf the Merger is consummated, UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners who continuously hold\nor own shares of UserTesting common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw\ntheir demands or otherwise lose their rights of appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in\nconnection with the Merger under Section 262 the DGCL (\u201cSection 262\u201d). The following discussion is not a\ncomplete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by\nthe full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by\nreference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a\nrecommendation that record holders or beneficial owners of UserTesting common stock exercise their\nappraisal rights under Section 262.\nAny person contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should carefully review the provisions\nof Section 262, which is attached hereto as Annex C, particularly the procedural steps required to properly\ndemand and perfect such rights. Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 for demanding and\nperfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. All references in Section 262 and in this\nsummary to a (i) \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of UserTesting common stock unless\notherwise expressly noted herein, (ii) \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d are to a person who is the beneficial owner of\nshares of UserTesting common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person,\nand (iii) \u201cperson\u201d are to an individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners who: (i)\nproperly submit a written demand for appraisal of their shares\u037e (ii) do not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in\nfavor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) hold or own such shares upon the making of a demand\nunder clause (i) and continue to hold or own their shares through the Effective Time\u037e (iv) do not thereafter\nwithdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, each in\naccordance with the DGCL\u037e and (v) otherwise exactly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262, may be\nentitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of\nthe \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of UserTesting common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from\nthe accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined\nto be \u201cfair value,\u201d if any, as determined by the court. A beneficial owner may, in such person\u2019s name, demand\nin writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner\u2019s shares in accordance with the procedures of subsection (d)\n(1) of Section 262 summarized above, provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares\nthrough the Effective Time and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the\nfirst sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262, and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner\nreasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is accompanied by\ndocumentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such\ndocumentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which\nsuch beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Surviving Corporation under Section 262 and\nto be set forth on the Verified List (defined below). The shares of UserTesting common stock are currently\nlisted on a national securities exchange, and, assuming such shares remain listed on a national securities\nexchange immediately prior to the Merger (which we expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has\nbeen filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who have\nasserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the\noutstanding shares of UserTesting common stock eligible for appraisal as measured in accordance with\nsubsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (b) the value of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration provided for\nsuch total number of shares exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the \u201cownership\nthresholds\u201d).\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest on an appraisal award from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the\njudgment will compound quarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal\nReserve\u201d)\n59 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the\nEffective Time and the date the judgment is paid. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of\nChancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to\neach person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case\ninterest will accrue after the time of such payment as provided herein only on the sum of (i) the difference, if\nany, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery, and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that\ntime. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such\nentry of judgment. Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the \u201cfair value\u201d of their\nshares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the\nvalue of the Per Share Merger Consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if\nthey did not seek appraisal of their shares.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of\nstockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its\nstockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which\nappraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section\n262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262\nmay be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes UserTesting\u2019s notice to our\nstockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262\nis attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any person who wishes to\nexercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so, should review Annex C\ncarefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may\nresult in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will\nbe entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover,\nbecause of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, we believe that if a\nperson considers exercising such rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nUserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of\ntheir shares of UserTesting common stock must do ALL of the following:\nthe person must not vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\nthe person must deliver to us a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the proposal\nto approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting\u037e\nthe person must continuously hold the shares upon the making of the demand through the Effective\nTime (a person will lose appraisal rights if the person transfers the shares before the Effective Time)\u037e\nand\nthe person or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery\nrequesting a determination of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days\nafter the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has\nno intention of doing so.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely revoked, be voted in favor\nof the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners should consult with their bank,\nbroker or other nominee regarding methods of voting.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny UserTesting stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to us,\nbefore the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted for stockholder approval, a written demand for the appraisal\nof such person\u2019s shares, and that person must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement. A person exercising appraisal rights must hold the shares for which they will seek\n60 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nappraisal upon the making of the demand for appraisal and must continue to hold the shares through the\nEffective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely\nrevoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and will therefore constitute a waiver of\nthe person\u2019s right of appraisal and nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a\nperson who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must ensure that the proxy\nsubmitted contains instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or to abstain from\nvoting. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting on the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal\nsatisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and\nseparate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A stockholder\u2019s or beneficial\nowner\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nRecord Holders\nA demand for appraisal in respect of shares of UserTesting common stock by a holder of record must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder\nand state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the\nMerger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee,\nguardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares\nare owned of record by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand\nmust be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for\ntwo (2) or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however,\nthe agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the\nagent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of record, such as a brokerage firm, bank,\ntrust or other nominee, who holds shares of UserTesting common stock as nominee or intermediary for one\nor more beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of UserTesting common stock\nheld for one (1) or more beneficial owners while not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In\nthat case, the written demand should state the number of shares of UserTesting common stock as to which\nappraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of UserTesting common stock is expressly mentioned, the\ndemand will be presumed to cover all shares of UserTesting common stock held in the name of the holder of\nrecord.\nBeneficial Owners\nA beneficial owner may, in such person\u2019s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial\nowner\u2019s shares in accordance with the procedures of subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 summarized above,\nprovided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the Effective Time and\notherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of\nSection 262, and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of\nthe shares for which the demand is made, is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial\nowner\u2019s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct\ncopy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive\nnotices given by the Surviving Corporation under Section 262 and to be set forth on the Verified List\n(defined below). Although not expressly required by Section 262, we reserve the right to take the position\nthat we may require the submission of all information required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3)\nof Section 262 with respect to any person sharing beneficial ownership of the shares for which such demand\nis submitted.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nUserTesting, Inc. \nAttention: Corporate Secretary \n144 Townsend Street \nSan Francisco, California 94107\nAny person entitled to appraisal rights who has delivered a written demand to us and who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or\n61 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nits demand for appraisal and accept the Per Share Merger Consideration by delivering to us a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal at any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time of the\nMerger. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person\nwithout the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such\nterms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of\nany person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to\nwithdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the Per Share Merger Consideration within sixty\n(60) days after the Effective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced, except with respect to any\nperson who withdraws such person\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding\nsentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with\nrespect to a UserTesting stockholder or beneficial owner, such stockholder or beneficial owner will be\nentitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could\nbe less than, equal to or more than the Per Share Merger Consideration.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will\nnotify each UserTesting stockholder who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to\nSection 262 and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and any beneficial\nowner who has demanded appraisal under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262, of the effective date of the\nMerger.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving\nCorporation or any person who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section\n262 (including for this purpose any beneficial owner of the relevant shares) may commence an appraisal\nproceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving\nCorporation in the case of a petition filed by a UserTesting stockholder or beneficial owner, demanding a\ndetermination of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares held by all such persons. The Surviving Corporation is under\nno obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and no person should assume that the\nSurviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the \u201cfair value\u201d of the\nshares of UserTesting common stock. Accordingly, any UserTesting stockholders or beneficial owners who\ndesire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in\nrespect of their shares of UserTesting common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section\n262. The failure of a record holder or beneficial owner of UserTesting common stock to file such a petition\nwithin the period specified in Section 262 could nullify such person\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has complied with the\nrequirements of Section 262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written\nrequest, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares\nnot voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which we have received\ndemands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning\nsuch shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand on his, her or its own behalf, the\nrecord holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for\npurposes of such aggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting\nUserTesting stockholder within ten (10) days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written\nrequest for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands\nfor appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of UserTesting common stock held either in a\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition\nseeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the Surviving Corporation and a copy\nthereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within\ntwenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (the\n\u201cVerified List\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their\n62 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of\nany such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the\nhearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the persons shown on the Verified\nList at the addresses stated therein. The form of the notice by mail shall be approved by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.\nAfter notice to the persons shown on the Verified List as required by the court, the Delaware Court of\nChancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those persons who have complied\nwith Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of\nChancery may require persons who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock\nrepresented by certificates (if any) to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for\nnotation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any person fails to comply with the\ndirection, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. In addition,\nassuming the UserTesting common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior\nto the effective time of the Merger, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to\nall persons who have asserted appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of \u201cFair Value\u201d\nAfter determining persons entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above has been satisfied as to the persons seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will\nbe conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules\nspecifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndetermine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of UserTesting common stock, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon\nthe amount determined to be the \u201cfair value.\u201d In determining \u201cfair value,\u201d the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good\ncause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will compound\nquarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established\nfrom time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date the judgment is paid. However, at\nany time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving\nCorporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will\naccrue after the time of such payment only on the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so\npaid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest\naccrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at that time.\nIn Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be\nconsidered in determining \u201cfair value\u201d in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise\nadmissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all\nrelevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Supreme Court of Delaware stated that, in making\nthis determination of \u201cfair value,\u201d the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings\nprospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the\nMerger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nMerger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a\n\u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the\nspeculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme\nCourt of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are\nknown or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares as so\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Per Share\nMerger Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their\nshares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of\nthe Per Share Merger Consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner\n63 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naddress, \u201cfair value\u201d under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of \u201cfair value\u201d\nas determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons seeking appraisal should recognize that such an\nappraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Merger\nConsideration. Neither UserTesting nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Merger\nConsideration to any person exercising appraisal rights, and each of UserTesting and Parent reserves the\nrights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any\nappraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of UserTesting common\nstock is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration. If a demand for appraisal is duly withdrawn, if a\npetition for appraisal is not timely filed, if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been\nsatisfied as to persons seeking appraisal rights (assuming the UserTesting common stock remained listed on\na national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger), or other requirements\nimposed by Section 262 to perfect and seek appraisal are not satisfied, then the right to an appraisal will\ncease.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal\nproceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to\nthe final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the\nVerified List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not\nentitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with\ninterest, if any, by the Surviving Corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each\nsuch person upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware\nCourt of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses\nof experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the\nDelaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose\nname appears on the Verified List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection\ntherewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including,\nwithout limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata\nagainst the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section\n262 or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under subsection (k) of Section 262.\nIn the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of UserTesting common stock under\nSection 262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, the\nstockholder\u2019s shares of UserTesting common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective\nTime into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest. A person will fail to\nperfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, such person\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed\nwithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above has been satisfied as to persons seeking appraisal rights (assuming the UserTesting\ncommon stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time of the\nMerger) or if the person delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the person\u2019s demand\nfor appraisal in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or\nall of such person\u2019s shares will be entitled to vote such shares of UserTesting common stock for any\npurpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the Effective Time. If no petition\nfor an appraisal is filed, if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to\npersons seeking appraisal rights (assuming the UserTesting common stock remained listed on a national\nsecurities exchange immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger), or if the person delivers to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal in respect of some or all of such\nperson\u2019s shares within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, then the right of such person to an appraisal\nof the shares subject to the withdrawal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any person without the\napproval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just,\nincluding without limitation a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the court made under\nsubsection (j) of\n64 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nSection 262\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any person who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the\nEffective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a\nrecord holder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder or beneficial\nowner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to\nexercise those rights.",

The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and\nRule 14a-19 promulgated thereunder, and generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement misrepresents\nand/or omits certain purportedly material information relating to the Merger, including allegations relating to\nthe background of the Merger, financial projections, analyses of our financial advisor and conflicts of\ninterest by company insiders in pursuing the Merger. The complaints seek a variety of equitable and\ninjunctive relief including, among other things, an injunction enjoining the consummation of the Merger,\nrescission of the Merger Agreement, rescission of the Merger if it is consummated, rescissory damages and\ncosts and attorneys\u2019 fees.

            "text": "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger\nthat may be relevant to our stockholders whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant\nto the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code,\nrulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial decisions, all\nas in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing\ninterpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change, which may or may not be retroactive,\ncould alter the tax consequences to our stockholders as described herein. This discussion is limited to\nholders who hold their shares of UserTesting common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of\nSection 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). For purposes of this\ndiscussion, a \u201cholder\u201d means either a U.S. Holder (as defined below) or a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below)\nor both, as the context may require.\nThis discussion does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of\ntheir particular facts and circumstances, nor does it address any consequences to holders subject to special\nrules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as:\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\ninsurance companies\u037e\n65 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndealers in securities\u037e\ntraders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting\u037e\nregulated investment companies\u037e\nreal estate investment trusts\u037e\ntax-exempt entities\u037e\nholders who hold their shares of UserTesting common stock as part of a \u201cstraddle,\u201d hedge,\nconstructive sale, or other integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions\u037e\nholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\npartnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, \u201cS\ncorporations,\u201d or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in\nsuch entities)\u037e\ncontrolled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies\u037e\nholders who hold their shares of UserTesting common stock as qualified small business stock for\npurposes of sections 1045 and/or 1202 of the Code\u037e\npersons subject to the alternative minimum tax\u037e\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\nholders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of UserTesting\ncommon stock (by vote or value) at any point during the five-year period prior to the Merger\u037e and\nholders that received their shares of UserTesting common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee\nstock options or otherwise as compensation.\nThis discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax consequences other than those pertaining to the\nincome tax (such as estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or non-U.S. income\nor non-income tax consequences, or the consequences of the Medicare tax on net investment income. If a\npartnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)\nis a beneficial owner of shares of UserTesting common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a\npartner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the\npartnership. Partnerships holding shares of UserTesting common stock and partners therein should consult\ntheir own tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger to their particular circumstances.\nNo ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe Merger described herein. This summary is not binding on the IRS or a court, and there can be no\nassurance that the tax consequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or that\nthey would be sustained by a court if so challenged.\nHOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME\nTAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES\nAND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of UserTesting\ncommon stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\na trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control\nof one or more United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that\n66 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nhas a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States\nperson as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of UserTesting common stock pursuant to\nthe Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will\nrecognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and\nthe U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of UserTesting common stock surrendered pursuant to the\nMerger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the\nshares of UserTesting common stock. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of\nthe Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain will generally apply to long-term capital gain of a non-\ncorporate U.S. Holder. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of UserTesting\ncommon stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger will generally not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax unless:\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United\nStates (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case\nsuch gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to a United\nStates person as defined under the Code, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may\nalso be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable\ntax treaty)\u037e or\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred eighty-\nthree (183) days or more in the taxable year of the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are\nmet, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate\nunder an applicable tax treaty).\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds\nreceived by a holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (i) a U.S. Holder\nthat furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to\nbackup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute successor form) or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder that provides\na certification of such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a\nsubstitute or successor form) or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be\nallowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability\u037e provided that the\nrequired information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nHOLDERS OF USERTESTING COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS\nREGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEIR PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX\nLAWS.",
