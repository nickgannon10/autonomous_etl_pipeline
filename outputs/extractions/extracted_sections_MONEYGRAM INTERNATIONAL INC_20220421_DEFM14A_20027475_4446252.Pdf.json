interpretation by the applicable regulatory\nbodies, the fact that the debt and equity financing necessary to fund the purchase price and the ultimate composition of Parent\u2019s\ncapital structure could affect Parent\u2019s ability to obtain and the fact that Parent\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement to obtain\nregulatory approvals are limited in certain ways\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that, while the Merger Agreement is not by its terms subject to a financing condition, if Parent fails to obtain sufficient\nfinancing (notwithstanding the terms of the debt commitments and equity commitments), the Merger may not be consummated and the\ntermination fee of $65.5 million payable to us by Parent in such event may not be sufficient to compensate us for potential losses we\nmay incur under such circumstances\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to MoneyGram\u2019s stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income

the Merger, as more fully described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Reasons for the Merger and\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors.\u201d Our board of directors concluded that,

        "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETING": {
            "text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETING\nThe following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger Agreement and\nthe special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the\n\u201cSummary\u201d and the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents\nreferred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, which you should read carefully. You may obtain the information incorporated by\nreference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nThroughout this proxy statement, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to MoneyGram.\nQ:\nWhat is the Merger?\nA:\nThe Merger is the acquisition of MoneyGram by Parent, an affiliate of MDP, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Once the Merger Agreement has\nbeen approved and adopted by MoneyGram\u2019s stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or, if\npermitted, waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into MoneyGram. MoneyGram will be the surviving corporation in the Merger and will become a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving the proxy materials?\nA:\nYou are receiving this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card or enclosed voting instruction form because our board of directors is soliciting\nyour proxy to vote at the special meeting of MoneyGram\u2019s stockholders in connection with a proposal to approve and adopt the Merger\nAgreement. In addition, our board of directors is soliciting your vote on an advisory, non-binding proposal to approve compensation that will or\nmay become payable to MoneyGram\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger and on a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to\na later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the\nspecial meeting.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive in the Merger?\nA:\nIf the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $11.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of our\nCommon Stock that you own at the effective time of the Merger. For example, if you own 100 shares of our Common Stock at the effective time of\nthe Merger, you will receive $1,100.00 in cash, less any required withholding taxes, in exchange for those shares unless you have properly exercised\nyour appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares. You will not receive any shares of capital stock in the\nsurviving corporation.\nQ:\nHow does our board of directors recommend I vote?\nA:\nOur board of directors has adopted resolutions (i) determining that the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are\nfair to, and in the best interests of MoneyGram and the stockholders of MoneyGram, (ii) approving, adopting and declaring advisable and\nauthorized in all respects the Merger Agreement and the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iii) directing that\nthe Merger be submitted to the stockholders of MoneyGram for approval at a meeting of such stockholders and (iv) recommending that\nMoneyGram\u2019s stockholders approve the Merger and approve all other actions or matters necessary or desirable to give effect to the Merger\npursuant to the DGCL. Our board of directors unanimously recommends that all of our stockholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of the\nMerger Agreement. The reasons for our board of directors\u2019 determination are discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement. Additionally, our board\nof directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to MoneyGram\u2019s\nnamed executive officers in connection with the Merger and FOR the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and\nappropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting.\n19Table of Contents\nQ:\nWho will own MoneyGram after the Merger?\nA:\nAfter the Merger, MoneyGram will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the receipt of cash in exchange for your shares of\nCommon Stock following the Merger, you will no longer benefit from any increase in MoneyGram\u2019s value, nor will you acquire an ownership\ninterest in Parent.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if our board of directors receives a superior proposal?\nA:\nIn the event our board of directors receives a proposal that our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal\nand financial advisors, constitutes a superior proposal, then, subject to complying with certain provisions of the Merger Agreement (including the\nprovision that requires us to provide Parent with the opportunity to negotiate with us to revise the terms of the Merger such that the proposal no\nlonger constitutes a superior proposal), our board of directors may, prior to obtaining the MoneyGram Stockholder Approval, elect to terminate the\nMerger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the superior proposal, provided that Parent shall have received a\ntermination fee of $32.8 million (or $16.4 million if the superior proposal was made by an exempted person (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Go-Shop\u201d), or $30.0 million if the superior proposal was made by an exempted person who is also prior bidder). In the event\nour board of directors terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the date of the special meeting, we will not hold the special meeting, and any\nproxies received by us will have no force or effect. Instead, we will separately prepare and mail to our stockholders a proxy statement and proxy\ncards related to the superior proposal.\nFor additional information regarding the circumstances in which our board of directors is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a\nsuperior proposal, please see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination\u201d beginning on page 111 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe are working to complete the Merger as soon as possible. The Merger cannot be completed until each closing condition has been satisfied or, to\nthe extent legally permitted, waived. While we cannot predict the exact timing of the effective time of the Merger or whether the Merger will be\nconsummated, assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, we currently anticipate that the Merger will be completed during the\nfourth quarter of 2022. If our stockholders vote to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, the Merger will become effective not later than the\nthird business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the Merger, subject to the completion or waiver of the marketing\nperiod under the Merger Agreement. Additionally, the Merger Agreement may be terminated if the effective time of the Merger has not occurred on\nor before February 14, 2023 (provided, that such date may be extended, in certain circumstances, to June 8, 2023 to permit receipt of required money\ntransfer approvals or completion of the marketing period). See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to Completion of the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 109 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not approved and adopted by our stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders\nwill not receive any payment for their shares of our Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public\ncompany, and our Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq. Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay to\nParent a fee, or Parent may be required to pay us a fee, with respect to the termination of the Merger Agreement as described under the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees and Expenses\u201d beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me?\nA:\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. Generally, you will recognize gain or loss equal to\n20\nTable of Contents\nthe difference between the amount of cash you receive and the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our Common Stock. If you are a U.S. holder (as\ndefined in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d), you generally will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger. If you are a non-U.S. holder, you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless you have certain connections to the United States. The tax consequences\nof the Merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances, and you should consult your own tax advisors to determine how the Merger will\naffect you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material United States\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat will happen in the Merger to stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards that have been granted to employees,\nofficers and directors of MoneyGram?\nA:\nThe Merger Agreement provides that (a) each outstanding option to purchase shares of Common Stock (each a \u201cMoneyGram Option Award\u201d)\ngranted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan, whether or not vested, that has an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration\nwill automatically be cancelled and retired, (b) each restricted stock unit subject to time-based vesting (including any award originally subject to\nperformance-based vesting for which the performance period has been completed and performance threshold satisfied and which is now subject\nsolely to time-based vesting) granted prior to January 1, 2023 pursuant to the Company Stock Plan representing the right to receive shares of\nCommon Stock that has not been settled (each, a \u201cMoneyGram Pre-2023 Time-Based RSU Award\u201d) will automatically become fully vested and will\nbe cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the\nMerger Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such MoneyGram Pre-2023 Time-Based RSU Award, (c) each\nrestricted stock unit subject to performance-based vesting granted prior to January 1, 2023 pursuant to the Company Stock Plan representing the\nright to receive shares of Common Stock for which the performance period has not been completed (each, a \u201cMoneyGram Pre-2023 Performance-\nBased RSU Award\u201d) will automatically become vested as to a number of shares of Common Stock subject to such MoneyGram Pre-2023\nPerformance-Based RSU Award based on achievement of the performance criteria set forth in the applicable award agreement at the greater of the\ntarget level and the actual level of performance achieved immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and will be cancelled and converted\ninto the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii)\nsuch vested number of shares of Common Stock, and (d) each performance-based cash award granted prior to January 1, 2023 pursuant to the\nCompany Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, representing the right to receive cash payments, whether subject to performance-based vesting\nrequirements or time-based vesting requirements (each, a \u201cMoneyGram Pre-2023 Performance Cash Award\u201d), will automatically become fully vested\nand be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the aggregate cash\namount payable pursuant to such MoneyGram Pre-2023 Performance Cash Award based on achievement of the performance criteria set forth in the\napplicable award agreement at the greater of the target level and the actual level of performance achieved immediately prior to the effective time of\nthe Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that, to the extent that any restricted stock units subject to either time-based or performance-based vesting\ngranted in or following calendar year 2023 pursuant to the Company Stock Plan, representing the right to receive shares of Common Stock\n(including any award originally subject to performance-based vesting for which the performance period has been completed and performance\nthreshold satisfied and which is now subject solely to time-based vesting) (such awards, a \u201cMoneyGram 2023 RSU\u201d), such MoneyGram 2023 RSUs\nwill automatically be converted into a cash-settled long-term incentive award, representing a right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any\napplicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of\n21\nTable of Contents\nshares of Common Stock underlying such MoneyGram 2023 RSU (with any MoneyGram 2023 RSU subject to performance-based vesting converted\nbased on achievement of the performance criteria set forth in the applicable award agreement at the greater of the target level and the actual level of\nperformance achieved immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger), on the same vesting terms and conditions applicable to such\nMoneyGram 2023 RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger.\nQ:\nDo any of our directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests as a stockholder?\nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of our board of directors with respect to the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, you should\nbe aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our\nstockholders generally. Our board of directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in making its determinations and\nrecommendations in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nInterests of MoneyGram\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 63 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\nA:\nThe special meeting of our stockholders will be held virtually on May 23, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MGI2022SM. You will not be able to attend the special meeting physically in person. For purposes of\nattendance at the special meeting, all references in this proxy statement to \u201cpresent in person\u201d or \u201cin person\u201d shall mean virtually present at the\nspecial meeting.\nQ:\nWhat constitutes a quorum for purposes of the special meeting?\nA:\nA majority of the total shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting present in person or\nrepresented by proxy at the special meeting is required for a quorum. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you do not vote for the\nproposals, or abstain from voting in respect of the proposals, your shares of Common Stock will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a\nquorum is present for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of determining whether\nthere is a quorum at the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat vote is needed to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock as of the record date is required to approve\nand adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the approval and adoption of the Merger\nAgreement.\nQ:\nWhy are we asking that our stockholders approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, certain compensation arrangements for our named\nexecutive officers?\nA:\nSEC rules require that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote on this proposal. However, approval of this proposal is not a\ncondition to completion of the Merger, and the vote with respect to this proposal is only an advisory vote by stockholders. Accordingly, the vote\nwill not be binding on us or Parent, our or their board of directors or our compensation committee. If the Merger is completed, the compensation\nthat is the subject of the proposal may be paid to our named executive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of their compensation\nagreements and arrangements even if our stockholders do not approve this proposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote is needed to approve the advisory, non-binding proposal relating to certain Merger-related executive compensation arrangements for\nour named executive officers and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional\nproxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting are needed to approve the advisory, non-binding proposal relating to\ncertain Merger-related executive compensation arrangements for\n22\nTable of Contents\nour named executive officers and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional\nproxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting. Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect\non the approval of these proposals.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to rights of appraisal under the DGCL?\nA:\nIf the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly\ndemand appraisal of their shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under\nSection 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of our Common Stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court.\nStockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of their legal and financial advisors with\nrespect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are\ndescribed in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to\nthis proxy statement. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 74 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWho can vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nStockholders of record of our Common Stock as of the close of business on April 20, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to\nreceive notice of the special meeting and vote their shares at the meeting. Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of the\nCommon Stock held on the record date for each of the proposals set forth in this proxy statement.\nQ:\nHow do I vote if I am the record holder of my shares?\nA:\nYou are entitled to vote at the meeting if you are a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the record date. You may vote:\n\u2022\nin person by attending and casting your vote virtually at the special meeting\u037e or\n\u2022\nby proxy. Stockholders of record have a choice of submitting a proxy:\n\u2022\nby using the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby using the telephone voting instructions printed on your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nby completing, signing, dating and returning each enclosed proxy card you receive in the enclosed postage paid envelope.\nIf you are granting a proxy to vote by telephone or via the Internet, your voting instructions must be received by the date and time indicated on the\napplicable proxy card(s).\nGranting a proxy to vote via the Internet, by telephone or by mailing in your proxy card will not prevent you from voting in person at the special\nmeeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by mail, via the Internet or by telephone even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, to\nensure that your shares of Common Stock are present in person or represented at the special meeting.\nIf you return a properly signed and dated proxy card but do not mark the box showing how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the\nproposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, \u201cFOR\u201d the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may\nbecome payable to MoneyGram\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adjourn the special meeting\nto a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient\n23\nTable of Contents\nvotes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting. With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the special\nmeeting, shares present or represented by all proxies received by MoneyGram will be voted with respect to such matter in accordance with the\njudgment of the persons named as attorneys-in-fact in the proxies.\nQ:\nHow do I vote if my shares are held by my brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee?\nA:\nIf your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, such as a bank or trust, then you are considered to be the beneficial owner of\nthose shares, with your shares being held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d \u201cStreet name\u201d holders generally cannot vote their shares directly and must instead\ninstruct the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote their shares. Brokerage firms, banks, trusts or other nominees cannot exercise\ndiscretionary authority to vote your shares regarding proposals that are not \u201croutine.\u201d The proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,\nthe advisory, non-binding proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with\nthe Merger, and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are\ninsufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting are not considered \u201croutine,\u201d and therefore your brokerage firm,\nbank, trust or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares for you at the special meeting if you instruct it how to vote. Accordingly, it\nis important that you promptly follow the directions provided by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee regarding how to instruct it to\nvote your shares. If you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must bring a proxy from your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee\nauthorizing you to vote at the special meeting.\nIn addition, because any shares you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of\nrecord, shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. To be sure your shares are voted,\nyou should instruct your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares. Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be\nvoted by an authorized officer of the entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, proxies corresponding to shares held through the MoneyGram\nInternational, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the \u201c401(k) Plan\u201d) will be voted as described in the section entitled, \u201cThe Special Meeting\u2014Votes Required\u201d\nbeginning on page 32 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote?\nA:\nThe vote to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement is based on the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of\nbusiness on the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to\napprove and adopt the Merger Agreement. If you do not vote and there is a quorum present at the special meeting, it will have no impact on the\nproposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to MoneyGram\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger or the\nproposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to\nadopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting.\nQ:\nHow do the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers intend to vote?\nA:\nAs of April 20, 2022, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned in the aggregate 3,241,298 shares of Common Stock, or approximately\n3.4% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of April 20, 2022. Although none of the directors or executive officers is obligated to vote to\napprove the Merger, we currently expect that each of these individuals will vote all of his or her shares in favor of each of the proposals to be\npresented at the special meeting.\n24\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered in your name with MoneyGram\u2019s transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are the \u201cstockholder of record\u201d of those\nshares. In that case, the proxy statement and any accompanying documents have been provided directly to you by MoneyGram.\nIf your shares are not registered in your own name and, instead, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee holds your shares, you are a \u201cbeneficial\nowner\u201d of shares held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at\nthe special meeting. The proxy statement and any accompanying documents have been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, trust or other\nnominee. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares by using the\nvoting instruction form or by following their instructions for voting by telephone or on the Internet.\nUnder the rules applicable to broker-dealers, your bank, broker, or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on any\nof the proposals scheduled to be voted on at the special meeting. A so-called \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d results when banks, brokers and other nominees\nreturn a valid proxy but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not\nreceived specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. MoneyGram does not expect any broker non-votes at the special\nmeeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals\nthat are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the special meeting are considered non-routine under the federal\nsecurities laws. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Common Stock at the special meeting without receiving instructions.\nFailure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will (i) have the same effect as a vote \u201cagainst\u201d the Merger Agreement and (ii) will cause\nyour shares not to be counted toward a quorum, but will have no effect on the proposal to approve compensation, or the proposal to adjourn the\nspecial meeting, if a quorum is present.\nQ:\nHow can I change or revoke my vote?\nA:\nProxies may be revoked or changed if you:\n\u2022\ndeliver a signed, written revocation letter, dated later than the proxy and which must be received prior to the special meeting, to MoneyGram\nInternational, Inc., 2828 North Harwood Street, 15th Floor, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Corporate Secretary\u037e\n\u2022\ndeliver a signed proxy, dated later than the prior proxy and which must be received prior to the special meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nvote again by telephone or on the Internet by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the day before the special meeting\u037e or\n\u2022\nattend the special meeting and give notice to the inspector of election that you intend to vote virtually at the special meeting rather than by\nproxy. Your attendance at the special meeting will not revoke your proxy unless you choose to vote virtually at the special meeting.\nIf your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you must contact such broker, bank, trust or other nominee and\nfollow its procedures to revoke your proxy. If you are a participant in the 401(k) Plan, your proxy must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on\nMay 18, 2022.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a proxy, to vote your shares of stock. The written document describing the\nmatters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a proxy statement. The document used to designate a proxy to vote your\nshares of stock is called a proxy card. Our board of directors has designated W. Alexander Holmes and Robert L. Villase\u00f1or, and each of them, with\nfull power of substitution, as proxies for the special meeting.\n25\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of Common Stock voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, as your proxies, will vote your shares of Common\nStock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone processes or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares\nof Common Stock should be voted for or against, or to abstain from voting, on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before\nthe special meeting.\nIf you are the stockholder of record, and you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted\non a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,\n\u201cFOR\u201d the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to MoneyGram\u2019s named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit\nadditional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting. If you are the beneficial owner of\nshares held in street name, your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions from you.\nQ:\nWhat do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?\nA:\nIf you hold shares of Common Stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d and also directly as a record holder or otherwise, you may receive more than one proxy and/or\nset of voting instructions relating to the special meeting. Each proxy should be voted and/or returned separately in accordance with the\ninstructions provided in this proxy statement in order to ensure that all of your shares of Common Stock are voted.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock before the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you transfer your shares of\nCommon Stock after the record date but before the special meeting you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the\nspecial meeting but will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares.\nQ:\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nA:\nThe expenses of preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and the proxies solicited hereby will be borne by us. Our directors, officers\nand employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person. They will not be paid any additional\namounts for soliciting proxies.\nWe have engaged Alliance Advisors LLC (\u201cAlliance\u201d) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. We estimate that we will pay\nAlliance a fee of approximately $15,000, plus customary administrative fees for expenses related to calls made to or received from our stockholders.\nWe will reimburse Alliance for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify Alliance and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities,\nlosses, damages and expenses.\nWe may also reimburse brokers, banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock\nfor their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Common Stock and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nEven if you plan to attend the special meeting, after carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, please\nsubmit a proxy promptly to ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares of Common Stock in\nyour own name as the stockholder of record, please submit a proxy to have your shares of Common Stock voted at the special meeting by\ncompleting, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid\n26\nTable of Contents\nreply envelope\u037e by using the telephone number printed on your proxy card\u037e or by using the Internet instructions printed on your proxy card. If you\ndecide to attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If you are a\nbeneficial owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to see which of the above choices are\navailable to you.\nQ:\nShould I send in my MoneyGram stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, you will receive written instructions for exchanging your shares of our Common Stock for the Merger\nConsideration for each share of our Common Stock that you own at the effective time of the Merger, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nI do not know where my stock certificate is. How will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares?\nA:\nIf the Merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the Merger will include the procedures that you must\nfollow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock\ncertificate. MoneyGram may also require that you provide a customary indemnity agreement to MoneyGram in order to cover any potential loss.\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as banks, brokers and other nominees, to satisfy the delivery\nrequirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single\nproxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding.\u201d\nThis means that only one copy of this proxy statement may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household unless we have received\ncontrary instructions from one or more stockholders. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of this proxy statement to you if you contact us at\nthe following address: MoneyGram International, Inc., 2828 North Harwood Street, 15th Floor, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Corporate Secretary,\ntelephone: (214) 999-7552. If you want to receive separate copies of the proxy statement or annual report to stockholders in the future, or if you are\nreceiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy per household, you should contact your bank, broker, or other nominee record\nholder, or you may contact us at the above address or telephone number.\nSee the section entitled \u201cMultiple Stockholders Sharing One Address\u201d beginning on page 125 of this proxy statement for more information.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nA:\nMoneyGram intends to announce the preliminary voting results of the special meeting and disclose the final voting results in a Current Report on\nForm 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that MoneyGram files with the SEC are publicly available when\nfiled.\nQ:\nWho can help answer my other questions?\nA:\nIf you have additional questions about the Merger, need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares of Common Stock, or need\nadditional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please call Alliance, our proxy solicitor, who may be contacted toll-free at (855)\n973-0090.\n27\nTable of Contents\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",

Shares\nrepresented by broker non-votes will not be considered present and entitled to vote at the special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of\na quorum.\nVotes Required\nThe proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our\nCommon Stock as of the record date. Accordingly, if you abstain or fail to vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, or if you fail\nto give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the approval and adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must direct your broker, bank or other\nnominee how to vote your shares of Common Stock by following their instructions for voting. Brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of our\nCommon Stock in street name for customers who are the beneficial owners of those shares are not permitted to vote those customers\u2019 shares in the\nabsence of specific instructions from those customers.\nThe advisory, non-binding proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to MoneyGram\u2019s named executive officers in connection\nwith the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting, excluding abstentions and broker\nnon-votes, which shall not be counted as votes cast. Accordingly, assuming that a quorum is present, not voting at the special meeting, or abstaining\nfrom voting, will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and the vote\nwith respect to this proposal is only an advisory vote by stockholders. Accordingly, the vote will not be binding on us, Parent or MDP, any of our boards\nof directors or our compensation committee. If the Merger is completed, the compensation that is the subject of the proposal may be paid to our named\nexecutive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if our stockholders do not\napprove this proposal.\n32Table of Contents\nThe proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to\nadopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special\nmeeting, excluding abstentions and broker non-votes, which shall not be counted as votes cast. Accordingly, assuming that a quorum is present, not\nvoting at the special meeting, or abstaining from voting, will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. MoneyGram does not intend to call a vote\non this proposal if the Merger Agreement is approved and adopted at the special meeting. The vote required on this proposal is a vote separate and apart\nfrom the vote to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, and is not a condition to the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, you may vote to\napprove and adopt the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve the proposal regarding the adjournment of the special meeting and vice versa.\nMoneyGram does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide\nbrokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered \u201croutine.\u201d Since each of the proposals to be presented at the special\nmeeting are not considered \u201croutine\u201d under the applicable rules, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Common Stock at the special meeting\nwithout receiving instructions.\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares of Common Stock in any of the following ways:\n\u2022\nby casting your vote at the special meeting\u037e or\n\u2022\nby proxy. Stockholders of record have a choice of submitting a proxy:\n\u2022\nby using the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby using the telephone voting instructions printed on your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nby completing, signing, dating and returning each enclosed proxy card you receive in the enclosed postage paid envelope.\nIf you are not a stockholder of record, please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to see which of the above\nchoices are available to you. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote at the special meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from\nyour bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.\nIf you are a participant in the 401(k) Plan, your proxy will serve as a voting instruction to the Independent Fiduciary (as defined in the 401(k) Plan). The\nIndependent Fiduciary shall instruct the 401(k) Plan Trustee how to vote. The Independent Fiduciary shall follow each participant\u2019s instructions unless it\ndetermines that doing so would be contrary to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d). If no voting instructions\nare received from a participant in the 401(k) Plan, the trustee will vote those shares in accordance with the majority of shares voted in the 401(k) Plan for\nwhich instructions were received, unless the Independent Fiduciary determines that doing so would be contrary to ERISA and instructs the trustee to\nvote such shares differently.\nA control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Common Stock, and to confirm\nthat your voting instructions have been properly recorded when submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone. Please be aware that if you submit\na proxy over the Internet, you may incur costs such as telephone and Internet access charges for which you will be responsible.\nHolders of record of our shares of outstanding Common Stock on the record date are entitled to one vote per share on each matter to be considered at the\nspecial meeting. Holders of securities convertible or exercisable for our Common Stock, such as stock options, will not be able to vote such shares\nunderlying such securities.\n33\nTable of Contents\nAs of the record date, directors and executive officers of MoneyGram and their affiliates had the right to vote 3,241,298 shares of Common Stock, or\napproximately 3.4% of the outstanding Common Stock at that date.\nVoting of Proxies",

        "Background of the Merger": {
            "text": "Background of the Merger\nOn a regular basis, we and our board of directors, together with our financial and legal advisors, review and evaluate strategic opportunities and\nalternatives with a view to enhancing stockholder value. Such opportunities and alternatives our board of directors has reviewed include refinancing our\noutstanding debt, strategic investments in other companies, new strategic initiatives and product offerings, remaining as a stand-alone entity, and a\npotential sale of MoneyGram.\nIn January 2017, MoneyGram entered into a definitive merger agreement (the \u201cAnt Merger Agreement\u201d) to be acquired by Alipay (UK) Limited (\u201cAnt\nFinancial\u201d) at a price of $13.25 per share in cash, which agreement was subsequently amended in April 2017 to, among other things, increase the purchase\nprice to $18.00 per share following an intervening offer by Euronet Worldwide, Inc. to acquire MoneyGram for $15.20 per share in cash.\nIn January 2018, MoneyGram and Ant Financial agreed to terminate the Ant Merger Agreement due to the expectation that the transaction would not\nreceive approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. In connection with such termination, Ant Financial paid MoneyGram a\n$30 million reverse termination fee as required under the Ant Merger Agreement.\n36Table of Contents\nOn November 8, 2018, MoneyGram announced that it had agreed to extend its 2012 deferred prosecution agreement (the \u201cDPA\u201d) with the United States\nDepartment of Justice, Criminal Division, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District\nof Pennsylvania (collectively the \u201cDepartment\u201d) by 30 months and agreed to pay a $125 million fine due to alleged weaknesses in MoneyGram\u2019s anti-\nmoney laundering program resulting in a breach of the DPA. MoneyGram paid $70 million of the fine in November 2018, with the remaining $55 million to\nbe paid in May 2020. In the trading day following MoneyGram\u2019s announcement of the DPA extension, MoneyGram\u2019s stock price declined 49%, from $4.47\nto $2.27.\nIn January 2019, at the direction of our board of directors, MoneyGram launched a strategic review process, with the assistance of its financial advisor,\nBofA Securities, Inc., during which BofA Securities broadly solicited potential purchasers of MoneyGram in an effort to enable our board of directors to\ndetermine whether a transaction may be available that would be in the best interests of MoneyGram stockholders. During the process, BofA Securities,\non behalf of MoneyGram, contacted 22 potential buyers, consisting of 6 potential strategic buyers and 16 potential financial buyers, including MDP and\nseveral other parties contacted during the 2021 sale process, as described below. Of the 22 contacted parties, only one party, a private equity firm, referred\nto as Party A, submitted a non-binding acquisition proposal, which provided for a purchase price of $2.75 to $3.25 per share, while MoneyGram\u2019s stock\nprice was $2.53 per share on February 27, 2019, the date the proposal was received. After discussion among our board of directors and its financial and\nlegal advisors, our board of directors instructed BofA Securities to tell the potential buyer that a proposal of $2.75 to $3.25 was not compelling at such\ntime. Discussions with the potential buyer then ceased.\nDuring the spring of 2019, MoneyGram contacted various potential lenders regarding a refinancing of MoneyGram\u2019s debt.\nAlso in the spring of 2019, MoneyGram engaged in preliminary merger and financing discussions with a consortium of domestic and foreign investors,\nreferred to as the Consortium, introduced to MoneyGram by a representative of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (\u201cTHL\u201d), MoneyGram\u2019s largest stockholder\nat the time.\nOn April 19, 2019, MoneyGram received a preliminary non-binding proposal from a strategic competitor, referred to as Party B, to acquire MoneyGram for\n$5.00 per share, a 106% premium to MoneyGram\u2019s closing stock price of $2.43 on April 18, 2019. Party B\u2019s proposal also included a conditional offer to\nprovide a partial refinancing of MoneyGram\u2019s debt in the form of second lien notes. However, discussions between MoneyGram and Party B ceased in\nApril 2019 as MoneyGram began to move forward with its refinancing process.\nOn May 3, 2019, the Consortium sent MoneyGram a draft non-binding term sheet providing for an acquisition of MoneyGram for $4.25 per share, a 35%\npremium to MoneyGram\u2019s closing stock price of $3.14 on May 2, 2019. However, discussions between MoneyGram and the Consortium ceased as\nMoneyGram began to finalize its refinancing process.\nIn June 2019, MoneyGram successfully refinanced its debt and entered into a new three-year revolving credit facility, a four-year first lien term loan\nfacility and a five-year second lien term loan facility. In connection with the refinancing, MoneyGram issued warrants to the second lien lenders\nfacility and a five-year second lien term loan facility. In connection with the refinancing, MoneyGram issued warrants to the second lien lenders\nexercisable at $0.01 per share for an aggregate of 5,423,470 shares of MoneyGram Common Stock (or approximately 7% of MoneyGram\u2019s then fully diluted\noutstanding Common Stock). Also in June 2019, MoneyGram entered into an agreement with Ripple Labs Inc.

The\nconfidentiality agreements between MoneyGram and each interested party described below included a customary standstill provision, but none of them\nprecluded an interested party from making a private proposal to our board of directors at any time. BofA Securities, at the direction of our board of\ndirectors, did not contact certain strategic parties, including Party B, due to competitive and regulatory concerns.\nOn December 2, 2021, a representative of Party D, who had previously been contacted by representatives of BofA Securities, contacted Mr. Holmes to\nexpress an interest in commencing potential acquisition discussions.

The confidentiality agreement contained a customary standstill\nrestriction but did not preclude Party H from submitting a private proposal to our board of directors at any time. Party H indicated that it would likely not\nbe in a position to acquire all of MoneyGram but that it may desire to act as a co-bidder with another potential buyer. Accordingly, the confidentiality\nagreement allowed Party H to act as a co-bidder with certain parties or with MoneyGram\u2019s consent.\nOn December 15, 2021, Reuters reported that MDP had submitted a proposal to acquire MoneyGram.

During this meeting, members of management and BofA Securities communicated to\nour board of directors that based on discussions with Party D the previous day, Party D was still not willing to expedite its timeline to signing a definitive\nagreement and there was substantial doubt that Party D would in fact make a definitive proposal at the end of that period. In light of such discussions\nand the fact that MDP indicated a willingness to increase its proposal to $11.00 per share if granted exclusivity, our board of directors approved granting\nMDP seven days of exclusivity so long as MDP accepted a Go-Shop Provision that did not exclude certain types of parties that had expressed interest\nprior to signing from such process. In addition, BofA Securities reviewed with our board of directors its preliminary financial analyses related to the\nvaluation of MoneyGram, which were substantially the same as the preliminary financial analyses reviewed at the meeting of our board of directors on\nJanuary 25, 2022. Also during this meeting, our board of directors, with V&E, compared the legal terms currently proposed by both MDP and Parties D\nand H. Our board of directors expressed general support for the terms negotiated with MDP.\nFollowing the meeting of our board of directors on February 2, 2022, Mr. Holmes called Mr. Dombalagian to notify him that MoneyGram was willing to\ngrant MDP seven days of exclusivity so long as MDP accepted a Go-Shop Provision that did not exclude certain types of parties that had expressed\ninterest prior to signing from such process. Mr. Dombalagian accepted this position.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOn February 3, 2022, MoneyGram and MDP executed an exclusivity agreement, which provided that MoneyGram would negotiate exclusively with MDP\nuntil February 10, 2022.\nFrom February 3 through February 10, 2022, MoneyGram and MDP engaged in continued discussions regarding a transaction, and V&E and Latham &\nWatkins exchanged several drafts of the merger agreement and related documents in an attempt to finalize acquisition terms.\nOn February 10, 2022, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of BofA Securities and\nV&E, to discuss the latest negotiations with MDP. During this meeting, members of management and BofA Securities communicated to our board of\ndirectors that discussions with MDP remained ongoing and that both MDP and MoneyGram continued to work towards finalizing transaction terms. Our\nboard of directors approved extending exclusivity with MDP for an additional seven days. In addition, BofA Securities again reviewed with our board of\ndirectors its preliminary financial analyses related to the valuation of MoneyGram. Following the meeting, MoneyGram and MDP executed an exclusivity\nagreement extension, extending the exclusivity term to February 17, 2022.\nFrom February 10 through February 14, 2022, MoneyGram and MDP and their respective advisors continued to work to finalize the terms of the\ntransaction documents.\nOn February 14, 2022, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of BofA Securities and\nV&E. During the meeting, our board of directors, with V&E, reviewed the final material terms of the proposed merger agreement and related documents,\nwhich are more fully described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d Also at this meeting, BofA Securities reviewed with our board of directors its financial\nanalyses of the merger consideration, which were substantially the same as the financial analyses reviewed at the meeting of our board of directors on\nFebruary 10, 2022, and delivered to our board of directors an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated\nFebruary 14, 2022, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger\nconsideration to be received by holders of our Common Stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The full text of the written opinion\nof BofA Securities is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. See also \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Opinion of MoneyGram\u2019s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration.\u201d Following the presentations and discussion, the members of\nour board of directors present at the meeting unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement and the merger, and unanimously resolved to\nrecommend that MoneyGram stockholders vote to approve the merger. In connection with this board meeting, BofA Securities furnished a customary\nrelationship disclosure memorandum to our board of directors.\nOn February 15, 2022, prior to the opening of trading of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq, the parties executed the merger agreement and issued a joint\npress release announcing the transaction.\nOn February 17, 2022, in accordance with the Go-Shop Provision in the merger agreement, BofA Securities, on behalf of MoneyGram, began contacting\nparties to gauge interest in whether any other buyer would be willing to acquire MoneyGram at a higher price than MDP. BofA Securities ultimately\ncontacted 39 new parties, including 21 financial parties and 18 strategic parties, and 4 parties that had previously been contacted by BofA Securities in\nDecember 2021, including 3 financial parties and 1 strategic party. Of such contacted parties, two strategic parties and one private equity firm executed a\nconfidentiality agreement, which included a customary standstill provision but did not preclude such party from making a private proposal to our board\nof directors at any time, and all other parties declined to pursue discussions with MoneyGram. MoneyGram granted access to an online data room to the\nthree parties that executed confidentiality agreements. However, none of the three parties submitted an acquisition proposal.\nOn March 16, 2022, at 11:59 p.m. Central Time, the 30-day go-shop period ended without any party submitting a proposal to acquire MoneyGram.\n46\nTable of Contents\nReasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of Our Board of Directors",

        "Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of Our Board of Directors": {
            "text": "Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of Our Board of Directors\nAt a meeting of our board of directors held on February 14, 2022, our board of directors approved and adopted the Merger Agreement and the Merger.\nOur board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of MoneyGram vote \u201cfor\u201d the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement\nand the Merger.\nIn the course of reaching its decision, our board of directors consulted with our senior management and our financial and legal advisors, reviewed a\nsignificant amount of information and considered a number of factors, including, among others, the following (which factors are not necessarily\npresented in order of relative importance), each of which our board of directors believed supported its determination and recommendation:\n\u2022\nMerger Consideration. Our board of directors considered that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as Merger Consideration provides\nstockholders with the best value reasonably obtainable for their shares of MoneyGram Common Stock. Specifically, our board of directors\nconsidered:\no\nthe fact that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as Merger Consideration represented a premium of approximately (i) 50% to $7.34,\nthe closing price of our Common Stock on December 14, 2021, the last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a possible\ntransaction, (ii) 28% to $8.62, the closing price on February 11, 2022, the last trading day prior to the approval by our board of\ndirectors of the Merger, and (iii) 56% to the volume-weighted average trading price of $7.04 for the 90-day period ended December 14,\n2021, the last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a possible transaction\u037e\no\nthe belief of our board of directors that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as Merger Consideration was the highest price per\nshare that MDP was willing to agree to pay, particularly in light of the fact that MDP had twice increased its proposed price in the\ncourse of its negotiations with MoneyGram (as more fully described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d), and the view of\nour board of directors as to the likelihood that any third party would be willing to pay more to acquire MoneyGram on the same or\nsubstantially similar terms\u037e and\no\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration would be paid solely in cash, without a financing contingency, which, compared to non-cash\nconsideration, provides certainty and immediate liquidity and value to our stockholders and does not expose them to any future risks\nrelated to the business or the financial markets generally, in each case upon and assuming closing of the Merger.\n\u2022\nBest Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value After a Thorough Sale Process. Our board of directors considered its assessment as\nto the possibility that a third party with sufficient financial means would agree to a transaction at a higher price than MDP on similar or more\nfavorable terms, given the fact that the Merger is the result of an extensive sale process conducted by BofA Securities, during which BofA\nSecurities contacted 13 potential strategic acquirers and 20 financial acquirers (including MDP) concerning their interest in an acquisition of\nMoneyGram and of these only MDP and three other parties made a proposal and only MDP submitted a final bid. In addition, while the sale\nand extensive due diligence process was conducted privately, several media stories were published regarding MDP\u2019s proposals to acquire\nMoneyGram, making it more likely, in the view of our board of directors, that potential acquirers with serious interest in acquiring\nMoneyGram who had not been contacted by BofA Securities would still be aware of the potential for a sale and would have approached\nMoneyGram. In addition to the thorough sales process we conducted prior to signing the Merger Agreement, our board of directors also\nconsidered the additional opportunities potential acquirers would have to participate in a go-shop process following signing, more fully\ndescribed under \u201c\u2014Merger Agreement\u201d below. MoneyGram\u2019s sale process is more fully described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the\nMerger.\u201d\n47Table of Contents\n\u2022\nRisks associated with continued independence. Our board of directors considered the risks associated with continued independence,\nincluding:\no\nrisks associated with operating in a highly competitive industry, including that some of our competitors have larger market share,\nmore established customer bases and substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have, and the risks that\nother third parties with more resources, including certain of MoneyGram\u2019s agents, may enter the marketplace in the future\u037e\no\nrisks associated with operating in a rapidly changing competitive landscape in the payments industry, which includes competing\ndisruptive digital technologies\u037e\no\nrisks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry, including with respect to laws and regulations intended to prevent\nconsumer fraud, money laundering and terrorism financing, the high ongoing compliance costs associated with operating in such\nindustry, and the possibility of litigation or investigations involving us or our agents\u037e\no\nrisks associated with our reliance on key agents and markets\u037e\no\nrisks associated with our indebtedness, including our debt service obligations, debt covenant requirements and our below\n\u201cinvestment grade\u201d credit ratings\u037e\no\nrisks associated with the uncertainties relating to inflation on MoneyGram\u2019s business, cost structure and operations and other factors\naffecting global economic activity\u037e\no\nrisks associated with any potential outbreak, continuation or escalation of war or hostilities (including the potential conflict in\nUkraine)\u037e\no\nrisks associated with ongoing efforts and uncertainty relating to COVID-19\u037e and\no\nother risks and uncertainties discussed in MoneyGram\u2019s public filings with the SEC.\n\u2022\nMoneyGram\u2019s current condition and future prospects. Our board of directors considered information with respect to our financial\ncondition, results of operations, business, competitive position and business strategy on a historical and prospective basis, as well as\ncurrent industry, economic and market conditions and trends. Our board of directors also considered the potential future value of\nMoneyGram, together with the risks associated with continued independence discussed above, as compared to the value of the Merger\nConsideration.\n\u2022\nOpinion of MoneyGram\u2019s Financial Advisor. Our board of directors considered the opinion provided by BofA Securities, dated February\n14, 2022, to our board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the Merger\nConsideration to be received by holders of our Common Stock, as more fully described in the subsection entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of\nMoneyGram\u2019s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration.\u201d The full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy\nstatement.\n\u2022\nCharacteristics of MDP. Our board of directors considered the business reputation and capabilities of MDP and its management, MDP\u2019s\nexperience executing acquisitions, the resources available to MDP to complete the Merger and the strong commercial incentives and\nmotivations of MDP to timely obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and complete the Merger.\n\u2022\nFinancing. Our board of directors considered the terms of the committed debt financing obtained by Merger Sub from major commercial\nbanks with significant experience in similar lending transactions and strong reputations for honoring their commitments and the terms of the\ncommitted equity financing provided by affiliated funds of MDP, including the nature and limited number of the conditions to the debt\nfinancing and equity financing, the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to use their reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to the\nequity financing and debt financing and the fact that the committed equity financing is in an amount that, together with the committed debt\nfinancing, would be sufficient to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\n48\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nLikelihood of consummation. Our board of directors considered the likelihood that the Merger would be completed in light of, among other\nthings, the conditions to the Merger and the absence of a financing condition, the absence of any condition related to the receipt of third\nparty commercial consents or approvals, the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals prior to the end date (after giving\neffect to any extension thereof already provided for in the Merger Agreement), Parent\u2019s representations and warranties relating to the equity\ncommitment letter, the debt commitment letter and Parent\u2019s solvency, and the remedies available to us under the Merger Agreement in the\nevent of various breaches by Parent, including the Limited Guarantee discussed below. Our board of directors also considered its belief that\nParent should, in particular, be incentivized to take considerable efforts to obtain necessary approvals from money transmitter license\nregulators in light of the $30 million reverse termination fee payable by Parent following the termination of the Merger Agreement in\nspecified circumstances when the required money transfer approvals have not been obtained.\n\u2022\nNegotiation Process. Our board of directors considered that the terms of the Merger Agreement were the result of robust arm\u2019s-length\nnegotiations conducted by MoneyGram, with the knowledge and at the direction of our board of directors and with the assistance of our\nlegal and financial advisors.\n\u2022\nMerger Agreement. Our board of directors considered the terms of the Merger Agreement, including:\no\nthe representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, the conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to complete the Merger and\ntheir ability to terminate the Merger Agreement\u037e\no\nParent\u2019s undertakings in furtherance of obtaining required regulatory approvals and the fact that the consummation of the Merger\nAgreement is (i) conditioned on obtaining only the required money transfer approvals (in addition to certain other approvals as more\nfully described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to Completion of the Merger), as more further described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nRegulatory Matters,\u201d and not all approvals related to money transmitter licenses and (ii) not conditioned on obtaining the consent of\nany third party under commercial agreements\u037e\no\nthe end date (after giving effect to any extension thereof already provided for in the Merger Agreement) under the Merger Agreement\non which either party, subject to certain exceptions, can terminate the Merger Agreement and the belief of our board of directors that\nsuch end date allows for sufficient time to consummate the Merger\u037e\no\nthe obligation of Parent under certain circumstances to pay us a termination fee of:\n\u2022\n$65.5 million, in connection with any failure to consummate the Merger if the relevant conditions are satisfied and in certain\ncircumstances following a breach by Parent or Merger Sub, as more fully described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014\nTermination Fees and Expenses\u201d\u037e and\n\u2022\n$30 million, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement in specified circumstances when the required\nmoney transmitter approvals have not been obtained\u037e\no\nthe Guarantors\u2019 obligation to guarantee Parent\u2019s payment of any termination fee payable under the Merger Agreement, along with\ncertain other obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, and the fact that MoneyGram has no obligation to\nseek payment from Parent prior to seeking to recover from the Guarantors\u037e\no\nthe right of MoneyGram and our board of directors to actively solicit offers with respect to acquisition proposals during a 30-day go-\nshop period and terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal during the go-shop\nperiod and for a period of 20 days thereafter, subject to Parent\u2019s right to receive payment of a termination fee of (A) $16.4 million if the\ncounterparty did not submit a bid or proposal or take certain other actions during the 180 days prior to execution of the Merger\nAgreement or (B) $30.0 million if the counterparty did submit a bid or proposal or take certain other actions during the 180 days prior\nto execution of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n49\nTable of Contents\no\nthe right of MoneyGram and our board of directors to entertain certain unsolicited acquisition proposals after the go-shop period and\nterminate the Merger Agreement prior to receipt of stockholder approval to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior\nproposal, subject to Parent\u2019s right to receive payment of a termination fee of $32.8 million\u037e\no\nthe belief of our board of directors that, although the no solicitation covenant, termination fee provisions and Parent\u2019s right to match\nany superior proposal might have the effect of discouraging competing third-party proposals or reducing the price of such proposals,\nsuch provisions are customary for transactions of this size and type, and its belief that the termination fee was reasonable in the\ncontext of comparable transactions, particularly given the discussions with certain other potential bidders that we held in advance of\nthe execution of the Merger Agreement, as more fully described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d\u037e\no\nthe right of our board of directors to change its recommendation prior to receipt of stockholder approval, subject to certain\nrestrictions, in connection with a superior proposal or other circumstances in which our board of directors determines the failure to do\nso would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law\u037e and\no\nthe right of MoneyGram, under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance of Parent\u2019s\nobligation to cause, and, pursuant to the equity commitment letters, to seek specific performance to directly cause, the equity\nfinancing sources to fund their contributions as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the equity commitment letter.\n\u2022\nOpportunity for MoneyGram Stockholders to Vote. Our board of directors considered the fact that the Merger would be subject to the\napproval of MoneyGram\u2019s stockholders, and that MoneyGram\u2019s stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger and vote for or against\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement at MoneyGram\u2019s stockholder meeting.\n\u2022\nCurrent economic and political conditions. Our board of directors considered the current state of the economy, debt financing markets,\npolitical climate and general uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic and political conditions, both in the near term and the long term,\nand both generally and within our industry, including the fact that valuation multiples in U.S. public equity markets are currently higher than\nhistorical trends.\nIn the course of reaching its decision, our board of directors also considered a number of potentially negative factors including, among others, the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\nMerger Consideration. Our board of directors considered the fact that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as Merger Consideration\nrepresents a discount of approximately 9% to the 52-week high of MoneyGram\u2019s stock of $12.04 reached on July 22, 2021.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with announcement and pendency of the Merger. Our board of directors considered the risks associated with the\nannouncement and pendency of the Merger, including:\no\nthe risk that the restrictions on the conduct of MoneyGram\u2019s business prior to the completion of the Merger imposed by the Merger\nAgreement may adversely affect MoneyGram\u2019s business in the event the Merger is not completed (including by delaying or\npreventing MoneyGram from pursuing business opportunities that may arise or by precluding actions that would be advisable if\nMoneyGram were to remain an independent company)\u037e\no\nthe risk that the public announcement of the Merger may cause substantial harm to our revenues, operating results and share price,\nour relationships with our employees, agents, customers and partners and our ability to attract and retain key management and\npersonnel\u037e\no\nthe risk that the Merger may divert management and employee attention away from the day-to-day operation of our business\u037e and\n50\nTable of Contents\no\nthe risk that the time period between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger will be significant due to the\nexpected time necessary to obtain required regulatory approvals, which enhances the above risks.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with a failure to consummate the Merger. Our board of directors considered the fact that there can be no assurance that\nall conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied or will be satisfied prior to the end date (after giving\neffect to any extension thereof already provided for in the merger agreement), and, as a result, the possibility that the merger might not be\ncompleted.\n\u2022\nRisks if the Merger is not consummated. Our board of directors considered the fact that, if the Merger is not completed:\no\nwe will have incurred significant risk and transaction and opportunity costs, including the possibility of disruption to our operations,\ndiversion of management and employee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our business and agent and\ncustomer relationships\u037e and, we may not be compensated completely or at all for such costs through the payment of a termination fee\u037e\no\ndepending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, it is likely that the price of our Common Stock will\ndecline significantly\u037e and\no\nthe market\u2019s perception of our prospects could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nRegulatory risk. Our board of directors considered certain regulatory risks, including:\no\nthe risk that necessary regulatory approvals may be delayed, conditioned or denied, including the fact that no termination fee would\nbe payable by Parent if certain regulatory approvals other than the required money transmitter approvals were not satisfied and\nParent was not then in breach of its obligations under the Merger Agreement\u037e\no\nthe fact that the standards for obtaining the required money transmitter approvals are not strictly quantitative standards and are\ninstead subject to interpretation by the applicable regulatory bodies, which may not uniformly apply such standards, and that the\ndebt and equity financing necessary to fund the purchase price and the ultimate composition of Parent\u2019s capital structure could affect\nParent\u2019s ability to obtain the required money transmitter approvals\u037e and\no\nthe fact that Parent\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement to obtain regulatory approvals are limited in certain ways, as more\nfurther described under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Regulatory Matters.\u201d\n\u2022\nFinancing risk. Our board of directors considered the risk that, while the Merger Agreement is not by its terms subject to a financing\ncondition, if Parent fails to obtain sufficient financing (notwithstanding the terms of the debt commitments and equity commitments), the\nMerger may not be consummated and the termination fee of $65.5 million payable to us by Parent in such event may not be sufficient to\ncompensate us for potential losses we may incur under such circumstances.\n\u2022\nMerger Agreement. Our board of directors considered certain terms of the Merger Agreement, including:\no\nthe restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Merger, which could delay or prevent us from realizing\ncertain business opportunities or taking certain actions with respect to our operations we would otherwise take absent the pending\nMerger\u037e\no\nprovisions that preclude us from actively soliciting alternative proposals to the Merger outside of the go-shop period\u037e\no\ncertain limitations on Parent\u2019s undertakings in furtherance of obtaining required regulatory approvals, as more further described under\n\u201cThe Merger\u2014Regulatory Matters\u201d\u037e\n51\nTable of Contents\no\nthe requirement that, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including by MoneyGram to accept a\nsuperior proposal, MoneyGram would be obligated to pay a termination fee to Parent and the right of Parent to match any superior\nproposal, each of which might have the effect of discouraging alternative acquisition proposals or reducing the price of such\nproposals\u037e and\no\nprovisions limiting Parent\u2019s liability under certain conditions where the Merger does not close to the reverse termination fee of $30\nmillion in connection with certain terminations arising from Parent\u2019s failure to obtain the required money transmitter approvals or $65.5\nmillion for other instances in which the reverse termination fee is payable.\n\u2022\nTax treatment. Our board of directors considered the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to MoneyGram\u2019s stockholders that\nare U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\u2022\nParticipation in future gains. Our board of directors considered the fact that MoneyGram will no longer exist as an independent public\ncompany and MoneyGram\u2019s stockholders will forgo any future increase in MoneyGram\u2019s value that might result from our earnings or\npossible growth as an independent company.\n\u2022\nLitigation risk. Our board of directors considered the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the\nconsummation of the Merger.\n\u2022\nRisk factors. Our board of directors considered other risks and uncertainties including those listed above in the section entitled\n\u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nWhile our board of directors considered potentially positive and potentially negative factors, our board of directors concluded that, overall, the\npotentially positive factors outweighed the potentially negative factors. Accordingly, our board of directors unanimously determined that the Merger\nAgreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of MoneyGram and its\nstockholders.\nThe foregoing discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by our board of directors in its consideration\nof the Merger, but is merely a summary of the material positive factors and material negative factors considered by our board of directors in that regard. In\nview of the complexity, number and variety of factors and the amount of information considered, our board of directors did not find it practicable to make\nspecific assessments of, quantify, or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, in\nconsidering the factors discussed above, individual members of our board of directors may have given different weights to different factors. Based on the\ntotality of the information presented, including discussions with, and questioning of, MoneyGram\u2019s management and its financial and legal advisors, our\nboard of directors collectively reached the unanimous decision to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger in light of the factors\ndescribed above and other factors that the members of our board of directors felt were appropriate.\nWhen you consider our board of directors\u2019 recommendation, you should be aware that certain of MoneyGram\u2019s directors may have interests in the\nMerger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of MoneyGram\u2019s stockholders generally. These interests are described in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of MoneyGram\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.\u201d\nThis explanation of MoneyGram\u2019s reasons for the Merger and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore,\nshould be read in light of the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\n52\nTable of Contents",

BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information for MoneyGram and\nthe following 12 selected publicly traded companies, which consisted of personal financial services companies, payment processors and financial\ntechnology (\u201cprocessor and fintech\u201d) companies and consumer finance companies.\nSelected Personal Financial Services Publicly Traded Companies\n\u2022\nThe Western Union Company\n\u2022\nH&R Block, Inc.\n\u2022\nInternational Money Express, Inc.\nSelected Processors and FinTech Publicly Traded Companies\n\u2022\nEuronet Worldwide, Inc.\n\u2022\nEVERTEC, Inc.\n\u2022\nEveri Holdings Inc.\n\u2022\nGreen Dot Corporation\nOther Selected Consumer Finance Publicly Traded Companies\n\u2022\nDiscover Financial Services\n\u2022\nSynchrony Financial\n\u2022\nAlly Financial Inc.\n\u2022\nSantander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.\n\u2022\nOneMain Holdings, Inc.\nBofA Securities reviewed, among other things, enterprise values (\u201cEVs\u201d) of the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as their equity values\nbased on their closing stock prices on February 11, 2022 and the number of their fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method, plus\ndebt, preferred stock, minority interests, the after-tax value of pension and post-retirement liabilities and SERP liabilities, and less cash, short-term\ninvestments and long-term investments, as a multiple of calendar year 2022 and 2023 estimated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and\namortization, not burdened by stock-based\n55Table of Contents\ncompensation expenses, special charges, one-time items and amortization of intangibles, but burdened by amortization of signing bonus payments, as\napplicable (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA (Burdened)\u201d).\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies\nEnterprise Value /\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(Burdened)\n2022E\n2023E\nSelected Personal Financial\nThe Western Union Company\n8.3x\n8.0x\nServices Companies\nH&R Block, Inc.\n6.6x\n6.5x\nInternational Money Express, Inc.\n6.1x\n5.3x\nSelected Processors and\nEuronet Worldwide, Inc.\n13.2x\n10.2x\nFinTech Companies\nEVERTEC, Inc.\n11.3x\n10.5x\nEveri Holdings Inc.\n8.3x\n7.7x\nGreen Dot Corporation\n7.1x\n6.0x\nOther Selected Consumer\nDiscover Financial Services\nN/A\nN/A\nFinance Companies\nSynchrony Financial\nN/A\nN/A\nAlly Financial Inc.\nN/A\nN/A\nSantander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.\nN/A\nN/A\nOneMain Holdings, Inc.\nN/A\nN/A\nOverall Mean\n8.7\n7.8\nOverall Median\n8.3\n7.7\nThe mean and median EV / calendar year 2022 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) multiples observed for the selected personal financial services\npublicly traded companies were 7.0x and 6.6x, respectively. The mean and median EV / calendar year 2023 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened)\nmultiples observed for the selected personal financial services publicly traded companies were 6.6x and 6.5x, respectively.\nThe mean and median EV / calendar year 2022 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) multiples observed for the selected processor and fintech\ncompanies were 10.0x and 9.8x, respectively. The mean and median EV / calendar year 2023 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) multiples observed\nfor the selected processor and fintech companies were 8.6x and 8.9x, respectively.\nThe overall low to high calendar year 2022 and 2023 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) multiples observed for all of the selected publicly traded\ncompanies were 6.1x to 13.2x (with a mean of 8.7x and a median of 8.3x) and 5.3x to 10.5x (with a mean of 7.8x and a median of 7.7x), respectively. Estimated\nfinancial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on public filings and publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates.\nOf the selected publicly traded companies, BofA Securities determined, based on its professional judgment and experience, that the market trading and\nvaluation characteristics of the personal financial services publicly traded companies and the processor and fintech publicly traded companies were more\nsimilar to MoneyGram than the other selected publicly traded consumer finance companies and that the personal financial services publicly traded\ncompanies were more similar to MoneyGram in terms of other characteristics than the processor and fintech publicly traded companies. Accordingly, for\npurposes of its analysis, BofA Securities examined only the selected personal financial services companies and selected processors and fintech\ncompanies (and not the other selected consumer finance companies), affording greater weight to the personal financial services publicly traded\ncompanies, and also took into account the relative historical trading prices of the selected publicly traded companies relative to that of MoneyGram,\namong others. BofA Securities thus applied calendar year 2022 and 2023 EBITDA multiples of 6.0x to 8.0x and 5.5x to 7.5x, respectively, derived from the\nselected publicly traded companies, to MoneyGram\u2019s calendar year 2022 and 2023 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) of $189 million and $231\nmillion, respectively, as set forth in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, to calculate ranges of implied enterprise values for MoneyGram.\nEstimated financial data of MoneyGram were based on the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections.\n56\nTable of Contents\nBofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges per share of MoneyGram Common Stock by deducting estimated net debt of\nMoneyGram of $710 million as of December 31, 2021, as provided by MoneyGram\u2019s management, from such enterprise values and dividing the result by\nthe number of fully-diluted shares outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, based on information provided by MoneyGram\u2019s\nmanagement. In applying the calendar year 2022 and 2023 multiples, BofA Securities took into consideration, among other things, the observed data for\nthe selected publicly traded companies and for MoneyGram, the historical trading prices of MoneyGram\u2019s Common Stock and the common stocks of the\nselected publicly traded companies and the differences in the financial profiles of MoneyGram and the selected publicly traded companies.\nThis analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share of MoneyGram Common Stock equity value reference ranges for MoneyGram, as\ncompared to the per share Merger Consideration:\n2022E Adj.\nEBITDA\n2023E Adj.\nEBITDA\nPer Share Merger\nConsideration\n$4.24 - $8.04\n$5.67 - $10.33\n$11.00\nNo company used in this analysis is identical to MoneyGram. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.\nRather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors\nthat could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which MoneyGram was compared.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis.

Lee Partners, L.P. and affiliates of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. for an approximately 79% equity stake through the issuance of preferred securities.\nBofA Securities reviewed transaction values (\u201cTVs\u201d), calculated as the enterprise value implied for the target company based on the consideration\npayable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company\u2019s latest 12 months (\u201cLTM\u201d) Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened). The overall low to\nhigh TV / LTM Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) multiples observed for the selected transactions were 3.6x to 13.8x (with a mean of 8.4x and a median of\n8.3x). Based on its professional judgment and experience and after taking into consideration, among other things, the observed data for the selected\nprecedent transactions, BofA Securities then applied a selected range of TV / LTM Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) multiples of 7.5x to 10.5x to\n57\nTable of Contents\nMoneyGram\u2019s calendar year 2021 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) of $164 million as set forth in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections,\nto calculate ranges of implied enterprise values for MoneyGram. Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available\ninformation at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction, and estimated financial data of MoneyGram were based on the MoneyGram\nUnaudited Financial Projections.\nBofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges per share of MoneyGram Common Stock by deducting estimated net debt of\nMoneyGram of $710 million as of December 31, 2021, as provided by MoneyGram\u2019s management, from such enterprise values and dividing the result by\nthe number of fully-diluted shares outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, based on information provided by MoneyGram\u2019s\nmanagement.\nThis analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for MoneyGram, as compared to the Merger\nConsideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value\nReference Range for MoneyGram Based on:\nMerger\nConsideration\nLTM 2021E Adj. EBITDA (Burdened)\n$5.23 - $10.18\n$\n11.00\nNo company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical to MoneyGram or the Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this\nanalysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which\nMoneyGram and the Merger were compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of MoneyGram to calculate the estimated present value of\nthe standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that MoneyGram was forecasted to generate during MoneyGram\u2019s fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year\n2026 based on the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for MoneyGram by applying terminal\nmultiples ranging from 6.0x to 8.0x, based on the historical trading range for the MoneyGram stock as a multiple of the terminal year Adjusted EBITDA\n(Burdened). The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.3% to\n10.4%, which were based on an estimate of MoneyGram\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per\nshare equity value reference range for MoneyGram, as compared to the Merger Consideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value\nReference Range for MoneyGram\nMerger\nConsideration\n$9.72 - $15.43\n$\n11.00\nOther Factors",

            "text": "Miscellaneous\nAs noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014MoneyGram Financial Analyses\u201d represents a brief summary of the\nmaterial financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to our board of directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description\nof all analyses undertaken or factors considered by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex\nanalytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those\nmethods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA\nSecurities believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its\nanalyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative\ndescription of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and opinion. The fact\nthat any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other\nanalysis referred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of\nwhich are beyond the control of MoneyGram. The estimates of the future performance of MoneyGram in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested\nby BofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities\u2019 analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of\nthe Merger Consideration and were provided to our board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The analyses do not\npurport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or acquired or the prices at which any securities have traded or\nmay trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described\nabove are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities\u2019 view of the actual value of MoneyGram.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between MoneyGram and Parent, rather than by any\nfinancial advisor, and was approved by our board of directors. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of our board of directors.\nAs described above, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by our board of directors in its evaluation of the\nMerger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of our board of directors, management or any other party with respect to the Merger or\nthe Merger Consideration.\nMoneyGram has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee that is currently estimated to be $20.2\nmillion, approximately $1 million of which was payable upon the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and the remaining portion of which is contingent\nupon the consummation of the Merger. MoneyGram also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA\nSecurities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers,\nemployees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws. Pursuant to its engagement letter with\nMoneyGram, BofA Securities would be entitled to a transaction fee from MoneyGram in connection with any merger or similar acquisition transaction,\nirrespective of the identity of the acquirer. Such fee would generally be higher for a transaction that provides for greater merger consideration.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives trading,\nforeign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and\ninvestment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,\ngovernments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of\ncustomers or manage funds that invest, make or hold\n59Table of Contents\nlong or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including\nderivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of MoneyGram, Parent and certain of their respective affiliates.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial\nbanking and other financial services to MoneyGram and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services,\nincluding (i) having acted or acting as administrative agent, bookrunner, co-lead arranger for, and as a lender (including a swing line lender and a letter of\ncredit lender) under, certain credit facilities and/or agreements of MoneyGram, (ii) having acted or acting as sole sales agent on a registered at-the-market\noffering for MoneyGram and as a bookrunner on a bond offering for MoneyGram and (iii) having provided or providing certain foreign exchange, treasury\nand trade management services and products to MoneyGram. From January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived\naggregate revenues from MoneyGram of approximately $34 million.\nIn addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking,\ncommercial banking and other financial services to MDP and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies and have received or in the future may\nreceive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting as financial advisor to MDP and certain of its affiliates and\nportfolio companies in connection with certain mergers and acquisition transactions, (ii) having acted or acting as administrative agent, collateral agent,\narranger, bookrunner and/or lender for MDP and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies in connection with, among other purposes, the financing\nfor various acquisition transactions, (iii) having acted or acting as underwriter, initial purchaser and placement agent for various equity and debt offerings\nundertaken by MDP and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies and (iv) having provided or providing certain treasury and trade services and\nproducts to MDP and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies.

            "text": "Unaudited Financial Projections of MoneyGram\nExcept for a financial outlook with respect to the current fiscal quarter and year issued in connection with its ordinary course earnings announcements,\nMoneyGram does not usually make public detailed projections as to earnings or other results, due to, among other reasons, the unpredictability of the\nunderlying assumptions and estimates inherent in preparing financial projections. However, the senior management of MoneyGram regularly prepares, for\ninternal purposes, prospective financial information in connection with its ordinary course strategic planning and, in connection with the evaluation of a\npossible transaction, prospective financial information regarding MoneyGram\u2019s future performance on a standalone basis for the years 2021 through 2026\n(the \u201cMoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections\u201d) was provided to our board of directors and BofA Securities, as the financial advisor to MoneyGram,\nto assist in evaluating MoneyGram\u2019s operations and prospects and the Merger. In addition, the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections were\nprovided to MDP in connection with its evaluation of MoneyGram and its analysis of the Merger, as well as to certain other parties potentially interested\nin a transaction with MoneyGram. The MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections were prepared as of January 24, 2022 and have not been\nsubsequently updated.\nThe MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), the guidelines of the SEC with respect to prospective financial information or the\nguidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information. In the view of\nMoneyGram\u2019s management, this information was, based on certain growth assumptions, prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best available\nestimates and judgments at the time of its preparation, and presented, to the best of MoneyGram\u2019s management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the expected\ncourse of action and the expected future financial performance of MoneyGram on a standalone basis at the time of its preparation.\n60Table of Contents\nHowever, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being indicative of future results, and you are cautioned not to rely on the\nMoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections. The MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections do not reflect any impact of the Merger and do not take\ninto account the potential consequences should the Merger fail to be consummated, and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in those\ncontexts.\nNeither MoneyGram\u2019s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect\nto the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its\nachievability, and assume no responsibility for the prospective financial information. The report of the independent registered public accounting firm\nincorporated by reference into this proxy statement relates to the historical financial information of MoneyGram. The report does not extend to the\nunaudited financial projections and should not be read to do so.\nIn developing the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, MoneyGram\u2019s management made numerous material assumptions with respect to\nMoneyGram for the periods covered by the projections, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe revenues, operating expenses and margins from existing business activities\u037e\n\u2022\nassumptions with respect to organic growth projects and other capital investments, such as the amounts and timing of capital expenditures\nand earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), if any, associated with such projects\u037e\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of debt and equity\u037e\n\u2022\nassumptions relating to the demand for our services\u037e\n\u2022\nassumptions relating to the taxes we will incur in the various jurisdictions in which we operate\u037e and\n\u2022\nother general business, market, regulatory and financial assumptions.\nAll of these assumptions involve variables making them difficult to predict, and most are beyond the control of MoneyGram. Although MoneyGram\u2019s\nmanagement believes that there was a reasonable basis for the underlying assumptions related to the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, there\ncan be no assurance that such underlying assumptions will prove to be accurate or that the projected results will be realized, and the risk of inaccuracy\nincreases with the length of the forecasted period.\nThe MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections are summarized in the table below.\nYear Ending December 31,\n2021E\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n($ in millions)\nRevenue\n$ 1,284.7\n$ 1,401.1\n$ 1,516.1\n$ 1,637.4\n$ 1,730.1\n$ 1,819.2\nNet income\n$\n(28.6)\n$\n57.0\n$\n91.0\n$\n120.1\n$\n134.1\n$\n156.9\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$\n221.2\n$\n243.1\n$\n267.8\n$\n305.9\n$\n324.4\n$\n348.4\n(1)\n\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d for purposes of this table means earnings before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization, plus special charges and\nother one-time items, stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles. Amortization costs of signing bonus payments for MoneyGram,\nwhich were used by BofA Securities in calculating Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) as described above in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of MoneyGram\u2019s\nFinancial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration,\u201d were projected by management of MoneyGram to be $57.3 million, $54.5 million, $36.3\nmillion, $33.7 million, $31.4 million and $25.7 million for the years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-\nGAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income as a measure of operating performance\nor cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of any potential synergies or costs related to the Merger.\n61\nTable of Contents\nThe estimates and assumptions underlying the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections are inherently uncertain and, though considered reasonable\nby the management of MoneyGram as of the date of the preparation of such projections, are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic,\nregulatory and competitive risks and uncertainties that are outside of the control of MoneyGram and could cause actual results to differ materially from\nthose contained in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, including, among other things, the matters described in the section entitled\n\u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projections are indicative of the future\nperformance of MoneyGram, or that actual results will not differ materially from the results presented in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections.\nInclusion of the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as a representation by any person that the\nresults contained in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections will be achieved. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in\nthe MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, MoneyGram stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the MoneyGram\nUnaudited Financial Projections.\nAdjusted EBITDA contained in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections summarized above is a \u201cnon-GAAP financial measure,\u201d which is a\nfinancial performance measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the MoneyGram Unaudited\nFinancial Projections were relied upon by BofA Securities with the approval of MoneyGram\u2019s management for purposes of its opinion and by our board\nof directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business\ncombination, such as the Merger, if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures were not relied upon by BofA Securities for purposes of its opinion or by our board of directors in connection with its evaluation of\nthe Merger. Accordingly, MoneyGram has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial\nProjections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for,\nfinancial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by MoneyGram may not be comparable to similarly\ntitled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and\ncredits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with,\nand not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe inclusion of the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that such projections\nare material information of MoneyGram or predictive of actual future results nor should it be construed as financial guidance, and it should not be relied\nupon as such. The MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections are not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any MoneyGram stockholder\nto vote in favor of any of the proposals at the special meeting, but have been included solely because the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections\nwere made available by management of MoneyGram to our board of directors, BofA Securities and MDP, and the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial\nProjections were used by BofA Securities in connection with the rendering of its fairness opinion to our board of directors and performing its related\nfinancial analyses, as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of MoneyGram\u2019s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration.\u201d\nMoneyGram has made no representation to MDP, Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the\nMoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections.\nWE DO NOT INTEND TO REVISE THE MONEYGRAM UNAUDITED FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER\nTHE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE\nASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE MONEYGRAM UNAUDITED FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.\n62\nTable of Contents\nInterests of MoneyGram\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger",

Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory requirements may result in the loss or waiver\nof your appraisal rights.\nThis section is intended only as a brief summary of certain provisions of the statutory procedures that a stockholder must follow under the DGCL in order\nto seek and perfect appraisal rights.

If the shares are held through a brokerage\nfirm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee, a demand for appraisal of such shares must be\nmade by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as the record stockholder.

Notwithstanding the requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of shares, a person who is the\nbeneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to which demand has been properly made and\nnot effectively withdrawn, may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the statement described\nin this paragraph.\nUpon the filing of such petition by any such holder of shares, service of a copy thereof must be made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be\nobligated within 20 days after such service to file in the office of the Register in Chancery of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (referred to as\nthe \u201cDelaware Register in Chancery\u201d) a duly verified list (referred to as the \u201cverified list\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who\nhave demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving corporation.\nUpon the filing of any such petition, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may order the Delaware Register in Chancery to provide notice of the\ntime and place fixed for the hearing on the petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the\nverified list. Such notice will also be published in one or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general\ncirculation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The\nforms of notice by mail or publication will be approved by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the costs of these notices are borne by the\nsurviving corporation.\nAfter notice to the stockholders as required by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing\non the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights\nthereunder. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares of our Common Stock and who hold shares\nrepresented by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal\nproceeding, and, if any such stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder.\nEven if a stockholder\n77Table of Contents\ncomplies with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, because immediately before the Merger the shares of Common Stock will be listed on a\nnational securities exchange, the Court of Chancery shall dismiss the proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights\nunless (i) the total number of shares of our Common Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock eligible for\nappraisal or (ii) the value of the Merger Consideration for such total number of shares of our Common Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value",

        "Determination of Fair Value": {
            "text": "Determination of Fair Value\nAfter the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted\nin accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal\nproceeding, the Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value (or in certain circumstances described\nbelow, on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation in the Merger to each\nstockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding). Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines\notherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective time of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded\nquarterly and will accrue at 5.0% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period\nbetween effective time of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Despite the foregoing, at any time before the entry of a judgment in the\nproceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter\nas provided in the immediately preceding sentence only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the\nshares of our Common Stock as determined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. The surviving\ncorporation is under no obligation to make such a voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nIn determining fair value, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the\nSupreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of\nvalue by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d\nThe Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Court of Chancery must consider market value, asset value, the\nprice negotiated by the parties, the unaffected stock price, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be\nascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair\nvalue is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger [.]\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the\nDelaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies\nonly to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated\nthat \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the\nproduct of speculation, may be considered.\u201d In addition, Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual\ncircumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nStockholders considering appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of our Common Stock as so determined could be more than, the\nsame as or less than the per share Merger Consideration such stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger if such\nstockholders did not seek appraisal and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the\n78Table of Contents\nconsideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, \u201cfair value\u201d under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL. Although MoneyGram believes that the per share Merger Consideration is fair, we cannot make any assurances as to the outcome of the\nappraisal of fair value as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. MoneyGram does not anticipate offering more than the per share\nMerger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and MoneyGram reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for\npurposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of a share of our Common Stock is less than the per share Merger Consideration.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or by any holder of shares of our Common Stock entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders\nentitled to an appraisal. Any holder of shares of our Common Stock whose name appears on the verified list and, if such shares are represented by\ncertificates and if so required, who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery, may participate fully in all\nproceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair\nvalue of the shares of our Common Stock, together with interest, if any, upon the amount determined to be the fair value (or, in certain circumstances\ndescribed in this proxy statement, on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation\nin the Merger to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding) by the surviving corporation to the\nstockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock, forthwith, and, in the case\nof holders of shares represented by certificates, upon the surrender to the surviving corporation of such stockholder\u2019s certificates. The Court of\nChancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such Court may be enforced.\nThe costs of the action (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may\norder all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged, pro rata, against the value of all the shares of our\nCommon Stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses.\nAny stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal rights for shares of our Common Stock in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the\neffective time of the Merger, be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions thereon,\nexcept dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of shares of our Common Stock as of a date or time prior to the effective time of the\nMerger.\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective time of the Merger, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger\u037e after\nthis period, the stockholder may withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal only with the consent of MoneyGram. No appraisal proceeding in the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court of Chancery of the State of\nDelaware, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware deems just. If no petition for\nappraisal is filed with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, stockholders\u2019 rights to\nappraisal shall cease and all holders of shares of our Common Stock will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Inasmuch as MoneyGram has no\nobligation to file such a petition and has no present intention to do so, any holder of shares of our Common Stock who desires such a petition to be filed\nis advised to file it on a timely basis. Any stockholder may withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal by delivering to MoneyGram a written\nwithdrawal of its demand for appraisal and acceptance of the Merger Consideration, except that (a) any such attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days\nafter the effective time of\n79\nTable of Contents\nthe Merger will require written approval of MoneyGram and (b) no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be\ndismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and such approval may be conditioned upon\nsuch terms as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware deems just. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any stockholder who has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and accept the terms offered\nupon the Merger within 60 days after the effective time of the Merger.\nIf you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not vote your shares of our Common Stock in favor of the Merger and you must comply with the\nprocedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If you fail to take any required step in connection with the exercise of appraisal rights, it may result in the\ntermination or waiver of your appraisal rights.\nThe foregoing is a brief summary of the rights of MoneyGram stockholders to seek appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and does not purport\nto be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by MoneyGram stockholders desiring to exercise any appraisal rights available to them and\nis qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and\nSection 262, Section 262 will govern. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the\nDGCL. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this proxy statement.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss or waiver of a stockholder\u2019s statutory\nappraisal rights. In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, MoneyGram\u2019s stockholders who may wish to pursue appraisal rights should\nconsult their legal and financial advisors.\nFinancing of the Merger",

Generally, a U.S.\nholder of shares of our Common Stock will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received in the Merger and such\nU.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of our Common Stock converted into cash pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss will be determined\nseparately for each block of shares (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) owned by a U.S. holder. If the shares of our Common\nStock have been held for more than one year at the effective time of the Merger, the gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss, and will be\nshort-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for one year or less. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. holders may be\nsubject to reduced tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation.\nA 3.8% tax is imposed on the \u201cnet investment income\u201d of certain U.S. holders that are individuals, trusts or estates if their income exceeds certain\nthresholds. In the case of an individual, the net investment income tax will be imposed on the lesser of (i) an individual\u2019s \u201cnet investment income\u201d or (ii)\nthe amount by which an individual\u2019s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $250,000 (if the individual is married and filing jointly or a surviving\nspouse), $125,000 (if the individual is married and filing separately) or $200,000 (in any other case). In the case of an estate or trust, the tax will be imposed\non the lesser of (i) undistributed \u201cnet investment income\u201d or\n83Table of Contents\n(ii) the excess of adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust begins. For these\npurposes, \u201cnet investment income\u201d generally will include any gain recognized on the receipt of the cash for shares of our Common Stock in the Merger.\nInformation returns will be filed with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) in connection with payments to a U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger, unless\nthe U.S. holder is an exempt recipient. Under the United States federal income tax backup withholding rules, the paying agent generally will be required to\nwithhold 24% of all payments to which a U.S. holder is entitled in the Merger, unless the U.S. holder (1) is a corporation or comes within other exempt\ncategories and demonstrates this fact or (2) provides its correct tax identification number (social security number, in the case of an individual, or employer\nidentification number in the case of other stockholders), certifies under penalties of perjury that the number is correct, certifies as to no loss of exemption\nfrom backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Each U.S. holder should complete,\nsign and return to the paying agent for the Merger the IRS Form W-9 that each stockholder will receive with the letter of transmittal following completion\nof the Merger in order to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding, unless an applicable exception exists and is\nproved in a manner satisfactory to the paying agent. If a U.S. holder does not provide a correct tax identification number, the U.S. holder may be subject\nto penalties imposed by the IRS.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Generally, any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules described above may be credited\nagainst a U.S. holder\u2019s United States federal income tax liability, if any, or refunded by the IRS provided that the required information is furnished to the\nIRS in a timely manner.

In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing\npromptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) after (a) receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry, request, proposal or\noffer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal) that the Company receives after the Solicitation Period End Date,\nwhich notice shall include the identity of the person making such proposal or offer, a summary of the material terms of all such proposals or offers and\ncopies of drafts of proposed agreements, term sheets or letters of intent related thereto received by the Company, (b) of any change to the financial or\nother material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal received after the Solicitation Period End Date, and the Company shall\notherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of developments with respect to, and the status of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal (including by\nproviding copies of all proposals, offers and drafts of proposed agreements related thereto that have not already been provided pursuant to clauses (a)\nand (b) above) and (c) receipt by the Company or its Representatives of any request for non-public information received after the Solicitation Period End\nDate relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries\u2019 properties, books or records by any\nperson in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry, request, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a\nCompany Acquisition Proposal). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality or\nother agreement or obligation that would prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.\nA-40\nTable of Contents\n(e) Prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(h)\nin order to enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect a transaction constituting a Company Superior Proposal (and make a Change of\nRecommendation with respect thereto), if and only if:\n(i) the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether from an Exempted Person) that did not result from a material\nbreach of Section 5.4(b) and the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company\u2019s outside legal and financial\nadvisors) that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal\u037e\n(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Company\u2019s intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) (a\n\u201cSuperior Proposal Notice\u201d), which notice shall

Period\u201d), the\nCompany has negotiated, and has caused its financial and legal advisors (and other Representatives) to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the\nextent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Acquisition\nProposal ceases to constitute a Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any revision to the financial terms or any other\nmaterial term of such Company Superior Proposal shall require a new Superior Proposal Notice and the Company shall be required to comply again\nwith the provisions of this Section 5.4(e) with respect to such new notice, except that such Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days (rather\nthan four (4) Business Days))\u037e and\n(iv) at the end of the period (or periods) referred to in clause (iii) above, the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with\nthe Company\u2019s outside legal and financial advisors) that such Company Acquisition Proposal still constitutes a Company Superior Proposal after\ngiving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (iii) above and that a failure to terminate this Agreement in\norder to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its\nfiduciary duties under applicable Law.\n(f) Other than in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal (which shall be subject to Section 5.4(e) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.4(f)),\nprior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, make a Change of\nRecommendation if and only if (i) prior to taking such action, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company\u2019s and the\nCompany Board\u2019s outside legal and financial advisors, that failure to take such action in light of such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be\ninconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law\u037e (ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board\nintends to take such action (a \u201cChange of Recommendation Notice\u201d), which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts underlying the Company\nBoard\u2019s determination that an Intervening Event has occurred and the reasons for such Change of Recommendation in light of such Intervening Event\u037e\n(iii) for at least four (4) Business Days after Parent\u2019s receipt of a Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company has negotiated, and has caused its\nfinancial and legal advisors (and other Representatives) to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such\nadjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation would no longer be\nreasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under applicable Law\u037e and (iv) at the end of the period referred to in\nclause (iii) above, the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with the Company\u2019s outside legal and financial advisors) that\nfailure to make a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law after giving\neffect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (iii) above.\nA-41\nTable of Contents\n(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing a position contemplated by\nRule 14e-2(a) under

the Company Board of a \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d or similar communication of\nthe type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of itself constitute a Change of Recommendation) or (ii) making any\ndisclosure to the Company\u2019s stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) that the\nfailure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (including any legally\nrequired disclosure to stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or a Company Acquisition Proposal) (it being agreed\nthat this clause (ii) shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any such disclosure would otherwise have under this Agreement)\u037e provided, that in\nno event shall the Company or the Company Board make a Change of Recommendation except as provided in Section 5.4(e) or Section 5.4(f) and any\npublic disclosure by the Company or the Company Board relating to any determination or other action by the Company Board with respect to any\nCompany Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly and concurrently reaffirms the\nCompany Recommendation.\n(h) Except as set forth in Section 5.4(a), during the period commencing with the Solicitation Period End Date and continuing until the earlier to occur of\nthe termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and the Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate, waive,

With respect to any Money Transfer Change of Control\nFilings not set forth on Section 5.5(a)(y) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Foreign Regulatory Filings not set forth on Section 5.5(a)(z) of the\nCompany Disclosure Schedule (including in connection with any Permitted Co-Investor), each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its\nreasonable best efforts and cooperate with the other parties hereto (A) in timely making inquiries with Governmental Entities regarding the Money\nTransfer Change of Control Filings or Foreign Regulatory Filings (if and to the extent necessary to determine if a filing is required or advisable in\nconnection with the Merger), (B) in determining if any Money Transfer Change of Control Filings or Foreign Regulatory Filings are not required by\nGovernmental Entities in connection with the Merger, and (C) if obtaining Approval under such Money Transfer Change of Control Filings or such\nForeign Regulatory Filings would not reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition (as defined below), in timely making all Money\nTransfer Change of Control Filings or Foreign Regulatory Filings required to be made by it (except with respect to such jurisdictions where the parties\nagree that a Money Transfer Change of Control Filing or any Approval from Governmental Entity that issues, grants or administers Money Transmitter\nLicenses or Foreign Regulatory Filing is not required or advisable). The Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, without Parent\u2019s prior\nwritten consent, take any action within its or their control that would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition. Parent will not, without\nthe Company\u2019s prior written consent, agree to a Burdensome Condition on the Company that is not conditioned on the occurrence of and effective only\nas of or after, the Closing and that is not waived when agreed to by Parent as a condition to the Closing.\n(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including those set forth elsewhere in this Section 5.5, each of the Company, on the one hand, and\nParent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (i) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other parties hereto (including in connection\nwith any Permitted Co-Investor), (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, promptly inform the other party or parties of any\nsubstantive communication (oral and written) received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity with respect to any such\nfiling or Approval or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including keeping the other parties apprised, on a current basis of the status of\nsuch filing or Approval, including the Money Transfer Change of Control Filings, filings under the HSR Act and any Foreign Regulatory Filings), and of\nany substantive communication received or given in connection with any legal proceeding by a private party regarding the Merger, (iii) consult with and\nconsider in good faith the views of the other party or parties (subject to applicable Legal Requirements relating to the exchange of information) in\nconnection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of\nany party relating to proceedings with respect to any such Approvals or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) to use reasonable best\nefforts to, and to cause their respective affiliates and Representatives to, furnish to the other party or parties and to any Governmental Entities such\ninformation and assistance as may be requested in connection with the foregoing, including by responding promptly to and complying with any\nreasonable request for additional information or documents under any applicable Legal Requirements, (v) not, to the extent commercially practicable,\nindependently participate in any meeting (including substantive telephonic or virtual meetings) with any Governmental Entity in respect of any Approval\nwithout giving the other party or parties sufficient prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity\nto attend and/or participate in such meeting (including substantive telephonic or virtual meetings), and, in the event such party does not attend such\nmeeting after receiving notice (including substantive telephonic or virtual meetings), if requested, provide as promptly as practicable a reasonable\nsummary of the substance of such meeting (including substantive telephonic or virtual meetings), and (vi) to use reasonable best efforts to comply with\nagreed-upon (by Parent and the Company) terms and conditions of all such Approvals of all such Governmental Entities (including in connection with\nany Permitted Co-Investor who becomes or seeks to become after the date of this Agreement an equity investor in\nA-43\nTable of Contents\nParent as of the Closing (giving effect to the Merger)). Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from\nany Governmental Entity whose consent, non-objection or approval is required or asserted to be required for consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated by this Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any consent, non-objection or approval will\nnot be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed or conditioned. Without limiting any party\u2019s obligation to provide\ninformation to any Governmental Entity, notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.5 to the contrary, materials provided by or on behalf of Parent to the\nCompany or its counsel or the Company to Parent or its counsel may be redacted to the extent necessary (a) to remove references concerning Parent\u2019s or\nthe Company\u2019s valuation analyses with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) as necessary to comply with Contracts in effect on the date\nhereof or (c) to remove personal, proprietary, privileged and other confidential business information\u037e provided with respect to (b) and (c), the parties will\nuse reasonable best efforts to minimize the information or materials that cannot be shared, to utilize customary mechanisms to permit sharing while\nprotecting confidentiality, privilege or compliance (such as confidentiality agreements) and to seek a waiver or disclosure if requested by the party hereto\nseeking disclosure.\n(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent after, to the extent permitted by law, consulting in good faith with the Company and\nconsidering in good faith the Company\u2019s views and comments, shall have the principal responsibility for determining the strategy to be pursued for\nobtaining, and directing the effort to obtain, all necessary actions or non-actions and Approvals from Governmental Entities with respect to the HSR Act,\nForeign Regulatory Laws, Money Transmitter Licenses and other Approvals in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement\n(including in connection with any Permitted Co-Investor)\u037e provided, however, that the Company\u2019s written consent shall be required prior to the taking of\nany action in connection with obtaining any such Approvals if such action would result in the imposition of a Burdensome Condition on the Company\nthat is not waived by Parent and not conditioned on, and effective only as of or after, the Closing. The Company shall not, and shall cause its\nSubsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement, commitment, obligation or settlement with any Governmental Entity (including any Governmental Entity\nthat issues, grants, or administers Money Transmitter Licenses) with respect to any Approvals required hereunder (including the Money Transfer\nChange of Control Filings or Foreign Regulatory Filings) without Parent\u2019s prior written consent.\n(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require (or be deemed to\nrequire or interpreted as requiring) Parent or any of its affiliates to agree to or take (nor shall the Company or its Subsidiaries, without Parent\u2019s prior\nwritten consent, take or agree to take or be required to take prior to or after the Closing) any action, make any agreement, settlement, or commitment,\nprovide any consent for any reason, or suffer any restriction, obligation, liability or other detriment, with respect to obtaining Money Transmitter\nLicenses, Approvals in connection with the HSR Act, the Foreign Regulatory Filings or any other Approvals required in connection with the Merger\n(including in connection with any Permitted Co-Investor) that when taken, whether in and of itself or collectively with any other obligation or action taken\npursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, would, or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, (A) have a\nMaterial Adverse Effect, (B) require the Guarantors, Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to incur economic detriment\n(including through making payments, losing or forgoing revenue or earnings, divesting assets, incurring liabilities or limitations on operations, or\notherwise) of more than $30,000,000 in the aggregate for all such persons when taken together with all such other economic detriments incurred in\ncomplying with this Agreement, (C) prevent the utilization of the Financing at and after the Closing as contemplated in the Commitment Letters (and the\ndefinitive agreements contemplated thereby) (including with respect to collateral security and ratings), (D) require any information to be provided by, or\nany restriction to be borne by, a person that is not delivering an Equity Commitment Letter or who is not a director or officer of Parent, the Company or its\nSubsidiaries (including from and after the Closing) or a Managing Director or officer of Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, or any Permitted Co-Investor\nthat will own, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of the equity interests of the Company, or any person who will serve as a director or executive officer of\nParent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (E) require Parent or its affiliates to seek prior approval of any transactions, investments,\nmergers or acquisitions from any Governmental Entity for any period of time, other than the Money Transfer Change of\nA-44\nTable of Contents\nControl Filings and Foreign Regulatory Filings contemplated by this Agreement (any such arrangements, conditions or restrictions, a \u201cBurdensome\nCondition\u201d). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and its affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to (and without the prior\nconsent of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not), take any action with respect to any Order or any applicable Law or in order to obtain any\nApproval which is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. In connection with Parent invoking a Burdensome Condition, the parties and\ntheir respective Representatives shall meet and confer for a reasonable amount of time in context in good faith in order to (i) exchange and review their\nrespective views and positions as to such Burdensome Condition and (ii) discuss and present to, and engage with, the applicable Governmental Entity\nregarding any potential approaches or workarounds that would avoid such Burdensome Condition or mitigate its impact so it is no longer a Burdensome\nCondition, (it being understood that this sentence shall not eliminate, limit, delay or impair Parent\u2019s right to invoke a Burdensome Condition if such\npotential approaches or workarounds are not acceptable to Parent in its sole and absolute discretion or could otherwise cause Parent to breach its\nobligations hereunder) and all such discussions will be treated in all respects as governed by and subject to Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence or\nany applicable equivalent state, foreign or local statute.\n(e) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.5 but subject in all respects to Section 5.5(d), each party hereto shall use their\nrespective reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents or approvals from any third parties (other than Governmental Entities) not otherwise\ncontemplated in Section 5.5(a) that are necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the parties\nhereto shall fail to obtain any such third party consent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably\nrequested by Parent to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and its Subsidiaries resulting, or which would reasonably be expected to result,\nafter the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with\nobtaining any such approval or consent from any persons (other than Governmental Entities) with respect to any transaction contemplated by this\nAgreement, (i) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to, or, without the prior written consent of Parent, shall, pay or commit to\npay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other\nobligation due to such person, and (ii) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such person\nwhose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation.\n5.6.

The Continuing\nEmployees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Plan of the Company or any Subsidiary during the same period for purposes of\napplying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of\nthe Parent Plan during the applicable plan year.\n(d) The provisions of this Section 5.6 are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and nothing in this Section 5.6, express or implied, shall confer upon\nany Continuing Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued\nemployment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement.
