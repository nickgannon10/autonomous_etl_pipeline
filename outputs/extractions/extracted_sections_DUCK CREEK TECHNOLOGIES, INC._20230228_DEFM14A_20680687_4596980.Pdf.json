            "text": "The Special Meeting (page 23)\nDate, Time and Place\nThe special meeting of Company stockholders (the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d) will be held on Tuesday, March 28, 2023,\nat 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time online at https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM.\nRecord Date\u037e Shares Entitled to Vote\nYou are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock of Duck Creek, par value\n$0.01 per share (\u201cDuck Creek Common Stock\u201d), including unvested Company RSAs (as defined below), at the close\nof business on February 9, 2023, the record date for the Special Meeting (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d). You will have one vote\nat the Special Meeting for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock you owned at the close of business on the\nRecord Date.\nPurpose\nAt the Special Meeting, we will ask Company stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on proposals\nto adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may\nbecome payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger (collectively, the\n\u201cSpecial Meeting Proposals\u201d).\nQuorum\nAs of the Record Date, there were 136,906,439 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to\nbe voted at the Special Meeting, consisting of 132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and\n4,013,460 unvested Company RSAs. The presence of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Duck\nCreek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting constitutes a quorum. As a result, 68,453,220 shares of\nDuck Creek Common Stock must be represented by proxy or by stockholders present and entitled to vote at the\nSpecial Meeting to have a quorum. Shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are counted as present if:\n\u2022\nsuch shares are present in person at the virtual Special Meeting\u037e or\n\u2022\na proxy card has been properly submitted by mail, by telephone or over the Internet with respect to such\nshares.\nIf you submit your proxy card, regardless of whether you abstain from voting on one or more of the Special\nMeeting Proposals, your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be counted as present at the Special Meeting for\nthe purpose of determining a quorum. If your shares are held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d your shares of Duck Creek Common\nStock are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum if your broker, bank, trust or other nominee\n \n1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nsubmits a proxy covering your shares. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and do not give any instruction to\nyour broker, bank, trust or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the Special Meeting, those shares\nwill not be entitled to vote on any Special Meeting Proposal and will not be counted for purposes of determining a\nquorum.\nRequired Vote\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested\nCompany RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs,\npresent at the Special Meeting or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Special Meeting, provided\na quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve\ncompensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the\nMerger. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding the Merger, will be approved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal is greater than fifty\npercent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special\nMeeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the proposal to approve\ncompensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the\nMerger. Because both proposals presented to Company stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, we do not\nanticipate any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the\npurposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have\nno effect on a particular proposal.\nShare Ownership of Duck Creek\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\nAs of February 9, 2023, the Record Date, Duck Creek\u2019s directors and executive officers beneficially owned, and\nwere entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 3,733,584 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, consisting of 2,098,465 shares\nof unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 1,635,119 unvested Company RSAs, representing approximately 2.7%\nof the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. We expect that Duck Creek\u2019s directors and executive\nofficers will beneficially own and be entitled to vote a similar figure at the close of business on the date of the Special\nMeeting. Duck Creek\u2019s directors and executive officers have informed Duck Creek that they currently intend to vote\nall of their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement and \u201cFOR\u201d the non-\nbinding, advisory proposal regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Merger.\nHow You Can Vote\nYou may cast your shares in any of four (4) ways:\n1.\nby voting over the Internet using the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card\u037e\n2.\nby telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card\u037e\n3.\nby signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided\u037e or\n4.\nby attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. To vote during the Special\nMeeting, you must do so by logging into https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM using\nthe 16-digit control number included in your proxy materials.\nIf your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are registered directly in your name, you are considered the\nstockholder of record with respect to those shares.\nIf your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other\nnominee, then the broker, bank, trust or other nominee is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect to\nthose shares. However, you are still considered to be the beneficial owner of those shares, and your shares are said\nto be held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d Street name holders generally cannot submit a proxy or vote their shares directly and\nmust instead instruct the broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote their shares using the methods described\nabove. Because the proposals are \u201cnon-routine matters,\u201d your broker, bank, trust or other nominee does not have\ndiscretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your\n2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a\nvoting instruction form with the Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions\nto your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the\nother proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a\nquorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were\ngiven, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. We encourage you to authorize your broker, bank,\ntrust or other nominee to vote your shares \u201cFOR\u201d both of the Special Meeting Proposals by following the\ninstructions provided on the enclosed voting instruction form to provide your instructions over the Internet, by\ntelephone or by signing, dating and returning the voting instruction form in the postage-paid envelope provided. \nYOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We encourage all stockholders to vote electronically. Please submit your\nproxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. If you do not have\naccess to a touch-tone phone or the Internet, you may alternatively vote by signing, dating and returning the\nenclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting. If you\nproperly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders will vote your shares as you\nhave directed.\nAll shares entitled to vote and represented by properly submitted proxies (including those submitted via the\nInternet, by telephone and by mail) received before the polls are closed at the Special Meeting, and not revoked or\nsuperseded, will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no\ndirection is indicated on a proxy card, such shares will be voted by the proxy holders named on the enclosed proxy\ncard according to the recommendation of Duck Creek\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) \u201cFOR\u201d both of the Special\nMeeting Proposals.\nParties Involved in the Merger (page 28)",

Specifically, one or more of the Complaints allege\nthat the proxy statement filed by Duck Creek with the SEC on February 16, 2023, in connection with the Merger\n(referred to as the \u201cPreliminary Proxy Statement\u201d) contains materially incomplete and misleading representations and\ninformation concerning the Company\u2019s financial forecasts, the financial analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and\nEvercore in support of their respective fairness opinions, the scope of the non-disclosure agreements entered into\nbetween Duck Creek and potential bidders in connection with a potential strategic transaction involving Duck Creek\nand potential conflicts of interests of certain insiders of Duck Creek. The relief sought in one or more of the\nComplaints includes enjoining the consummation of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain\nallegedly material information, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the\nterms thereof, granting rescissory damages, directing the defendants to disseminate a proxy statement that does not\ncontain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all required or necessary material facts, directing the\ndefendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result of the defendants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing, declaring\nthat defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated\nthereunder, and awarding the plaintiffs their respective costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 and\nexperts\u2019 fees and expenses.\nDuck Creek believes that the Complaints are without merit and Duck Creek and the individual defendants intend\nto defend against the Complaints\u037e however, Duck Creek cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be\nrequired to resolve the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.\nThe outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or\ndelay consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Duck Creek, including any costs associated with\nthe indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no\ntemporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the\nMerger will be in effect, nor will any action have been taken by any governmental authority (as defined in the Merger\nAgreement) of competent jurisdiction, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been enacted, entered\nenforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation\nof the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the\nMerger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated, or from\nbeing consummated within the expected time frame.\n \n8TABLE OF CONTENTS\nSolicitation of Other Offers (page 89)",

This means that Company stockholders and beneficial owners may\nbe entitled to have their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware (the \u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d), and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of\ncommon stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,\ntogether with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be the fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of\nChancery, as described further below.

If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved\nby the requisite number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, and the other closing conditions under the\nMerger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Duck Creek, with Duck\nCreek continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Duck Creek will become a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Parent and you will no longer own shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Duck Creek\nexpects to delist the Duck Creek Common Stock from Nasdaq and de-register the Duck Creek Common Stock\nunder the Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time.

See \u201cHow may I vote?\u201d in this section of this Proxy Statement for more information.\nQ:\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote?\nA:\nOn January 8, 2023, the Board, after considering various factors, including the unanimous recommendation\nof the Special Committee and the other factors described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-\nRecommendation and Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 48 of this Proxy Statement, and after\nconsultation with Duck Creek\u2019s independent legal and financial advisors, (i) determined that it is in the best\ninterests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement\nand consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) declared it\nadvisable and approved and adopted the Merger Agreement, approved the execution and delivery of the\nMerger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations\nthereunder, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement upon the terms and conditions set forth therein and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company\nstockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the\nother transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe Board recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby approving\nthe Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to\napprove, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its\nnamed executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificate(s) now?\nA:\nNo. If you are a record holder, after the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you\nwill receive a letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificate(s) to the paying agent in\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\norder to receive the cash payment of the Merger Consideration for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock\nrepresented by such stock certificate(s).

This will include an affidavit that\nyou will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to post a bond as\nindemnity against any potential loss.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not consummated?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Company stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any\nother reason, Company stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.\nInstead, Duck Creek will remain an independent public company, Duck Creek Common Stock will continue to be\nlisted and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports\nwith the SEC on account of Duck Creek Common Stock.\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Duck Creek may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee\nupon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger\nAgreement-Company Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 100 of this Proxy Statement.\nQ:\nDo any of Duck Creek\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ\nfrom those of Company stockholders generally?\nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, you should be aware that Duck Creek\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the\nMerger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company stockholders generally. The Board was aware\nof and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in\nevaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and the\nMerger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Company stockholders. For a\ndescription of the interests of Duck Creek\u2019s directors and executive officers in the Merger, see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger\u201d beginning\non page 72 of this Proxy Statement.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain\ncompensation arrangements for Duck Creek\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nUnder SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that\nmay be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nMerger, commonly referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation. If the Merger Agreement is approved and\nadopted by the Company stockholders and the Merger is completed, this compensation may be paid to the\nCompany\u2019s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and\narrangements even if the Company stockholders fail to approve this proposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested\nCompany RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company\nRSAs, present at the Special Meeting, or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon at the Special\nMeeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a\n \n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnon-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck\nCreek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement will be approved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal is greater than fifty\npercent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the\nSpecial Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement and the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its\nnamed executive officers in connection with the Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company\nstockholders will be considered non-discretionary, we do not anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special\nMeeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will\nnot count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.\nAs of February 9, 2023, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there\nwere 136,906,439 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special\nMeeting, consisting of 132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested\nCompany RSAs. Each holder of Duck Creek Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Duck Creek\nCommon Stock owned by such holder as of the Record Date.\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the\n\u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this Proxy Statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you\nby Duck Creek. As the stockholder of record you have the right to vote by proxy, which involves granting your\nvoting rights directly to Duck Creek or to a third party, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting.\nIf your shares are held through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner\nof those shares. In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, trust or\nother nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the\nbeneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares.\nWithout your voting instructions, because of the non-routine nature of the Special Meeting Proposals, your\nbroker, bank, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the Special Meeting Proposals.\nHowever, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other\nnominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those\nshares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special\nMeeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given, and will\nnot be voted with respect to any other proposal.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a \u201cproxy,\u201d to vote your shares of Duck Creek\nCommon Stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special\nMeeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Duck\nCreek Common Stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d The Board has designated Michael A. Jackowski and Kevin\nRhodes, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nCan I change or revoke my proxy?\nA:\nYou may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you\nattend the Special Meeting, by voting by ballot at the Special Meeting.\nIf you hold your shares as a record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following\nways:\n\u2022\nby re-voting at a subsequent time by Internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed\nproxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it\nfollowing the instructions on the enclosed proxy card\u037e\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nby delivering a signed revocation letter to Christopher Stone, Duck Creek\u2019s Secretary, at Duck Creek\u2019s\nmailing address on the first page of this Proxy Statement before the Special Meeting, which states that you\nhave revoked your proxy\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. Attending the Special\nMeeting virtually will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote\nby virtual ballot at the virtual Special Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.\nYour latest dated proxy card, Internet or telephone vote is the one that is counted.\nIf your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may change your voting\ninstructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.\nQ:\nIf a Company stockholder gives a proxy, how will the shares be voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your\nproxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process\nor the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting\non all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a\nmatter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will\nor may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. However,\nif you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee\nwith respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those shares will be\nvoted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given and will not be voted with\nrespect to any other proposal.\nQ:\nI understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a\nquorum?\nA:\nThe presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the\nSpecial Meeting constitutes a quorum. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 136,906,439\nshares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special Meeting, consisting of\n132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested Company RSAs. If you\nsubmit a properly executed proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In\naddition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be\ncounted for purposes of establishing a quorum\u037e however, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting\ninstructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, then those shares\nwill be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting. As\na result, 68,453,220 shares must be present or represented by proxy to have a quorum. If a quorum is not present,\nthe holders of a majority in voting power of the Duck Creek Common Stock, present or represented by proxy, and\nentitled to vote thereon, or the chairman of the Special Meeting, may adjourn the Special Meeting pursuant to\nDuck Creek\u2019s bylaws.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain a proxy card?\nA:\nIf you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card, please follow the applicable procedure below.\nFor Company stockholders of record: Please call Innisfree M&A Incorporated at (877) 717-3923 (toll-free from\nthe U.S. and Canada) or +1 (412) 232-3651 (from other locations).\nFor holders in \u201cstreet name\u201d: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar\ninstitution.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of\nbusiness on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be\nconsummated. If you sell or transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbusiness on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the\nprovision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares\nof Duck Creek Common Stock and each of you notifies Duck Creek in writing of such special arrangements, you\nwill transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is consummated, to the person to whom\nyou sell or transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares\nat the Special Meeting.

In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares\nof Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective Time.\nQ:\nWho will count the votes?\nA:\nThe inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the\nSpecial Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present.\nQ:\nWho will solicit votes for and bear the cost and expenses of this proxy solicitation?\nA:\nThe cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by Duck Creek. Our directors, officers and employees may solicit\nproxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic means. We will pay these\ndirectors, officers and employees no additional compensation for these services.

Duck Creek intends to notify Company stockholders of the results of the Special Meeting by\nissuing a press release, which it will also file with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash\npursuant to the Merger?\nA:\nThe exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 77 of this Proxy\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStatement) who exchanges shares of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize\ngain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to\nsuch shares and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 77\nof this Proxy Statement), the Merger will generally not result in U.S. federal income tax to you unless you have\ncertain connections with the United States.\nFor a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 77 of this Proxy\nStatement.\nQ:\nWhat will the holders of outstanding Duck Creek equity awards receive in the Merger?\nAt the Effective Time, each Company RSA, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately\nprior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an\namount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock subject to such Company RSA,\nmultiplied by (B) $19.00.

The Stand-Alone Projections were\nmade available to potential counterparties to a strategic transaction, including Vista, in connection with their due\ndiligence review of a potential transaction. The Stand-Alone Projections were prepared from October through early\nDecember 2022 and the Board approved the Stand-Alone Projections on December 5, 2022.\nThis Proxy Statement contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:\n\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA (or Adj.

The summary of the Stand-Alone\nProjections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts is not being included in this Proxy Statement to influence your\ndecision whether to vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse\nProjections and the Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines\nestablished by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of\nprospective financial information, or GAAP (and do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP).\nNeither KPMG LLP, Duck Creek\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm (\u201cKPMG\u201d), nor any other audit firm\nhas audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the Stand-Alone\nProjections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts and, accordingly, KPMG has not expressed an opinion or any\nother form of assurance with respect thereto. The KPMG report included in Duck Creek\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended August 31, 2022, which is incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement, relates to Duck\nCreek\u2019s historical financial information and does not extend to the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections\nor the Forecasts and should not be read to do so.\nThe Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts are subject to estimates and\nassumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation and reflect subjective judgment in many\nrespects, and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results and\nbusiness developments. While presented with numerical specificity, the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse\nProjections and the Forecasts are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain,\nthough considered reasonable by Duck Creek management as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and\nassumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons, which are difficult to predict and which are\nbeyond Duck Creek\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, competition and the risks discussed in this\nProxy Statement under the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d\nbeginning on page 22 of this Proxy Statement. The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the\nForecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Because the Stand-\nAlone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts cover multiple years, by their nature, they become\nsubject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each and every circumstance\nthat could have an effect on Duck Creek\u2019s business and its results of operations. There can be no assurance that the\nprojections contained in the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts will be realized, and\nactual results may differ materially from those shown therein.\nThe information in the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts is not factual and\nshould not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The inclusion of the summary of the\nStand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts in this Proxy Statement should not be regarded\nas an indication that Duck Creek or anyone else then considered, or now considers, such summaries to be necessarily\npredictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. In light of the foregoing,\nDuck Creek\u2019s stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance thereon. The Stand-Alone Projections, the\nImburse Projections and the Forecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial\nstatements and other information regarding Duck Creek contained in Duck Creek\u2019s public filings with the SEC.\nNone of Duck Creek, its financial advisors or its or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other\nrepresentatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Stand-Alone Projections, the\nImburse Projections or the Forecasts, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or\nreconcile, the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing\nafter the date the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts were generated or to reflect the\noccurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Stand-Alone\nProjections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Since the date of the\nStand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts, Duck Creek has made publicly available its\nactual results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, ended November 30, 2022. You should review Duck\nCreek\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 9, 2023 for information about Duck Creek\u2019s\nactual results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2022. Duck Creek does not intend to make\npublicly available any update or other revision to the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the\nForecasts, even in the event that any or all assumptions\n71\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nare shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable law, none of Duck Creek, its financial advisors or its or their\nrespective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to\nany Company stockholder or any other person (including Vista, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise) regarding the\nStand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts, Duck Creek\u2019s ultimate performance compared to\nthe information contained therein or that forecasted results will be achieved.\nInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger",

In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on\nthe sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause\nthe Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, and other similar\norganizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to\nindemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,\nexculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other\nsimilar organizational documents of the subsidiaries of Duck Creek, as applicable, as of the date of the Merger\nAgreement.

This discussion is based upon the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court\ndecisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), and other applicable authorities, all as in\neffect on the date of this Proxy Statement and all of which are subject to change or to differing interpretations at any\ntime, possibly with retroactive effect.\nThis discussion is limited to Company stockholders who hold their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock as\n\u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). In\naddition, this summary does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign\njurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g., estate or gift\ntaxation) or the alternative minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax that may be relevant or\napplicable to a particular holder in connection with the Merger.

Partnerships holding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock and partners therein should consult their\ntax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger.\nNo ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the\nMerger described herein. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a\ncourt will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE\nLEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR\nDESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE\nMERGER. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL\nINCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS. \nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock\nwho or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n78\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\na trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of\none or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (2) that has a valid\nelection in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person as defined in section\n7701(a)(30) of the Code.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Duck Creek Common Stock pursuant to the\nMerger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss generally\nwill be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in\nthe shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount\nthat such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the\ncompletion of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-\ncorporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S.\nHolder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must\ndetermine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to each block of common stock.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Duck Creek Common\nStock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSubject to the discussion under \u201cInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\u201d below, any gain realized by\na Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nThe gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the\nUnited States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income tax, net of certain deductions, at rates generally applicable to U.S.\npersons (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise), and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a\ncorporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a rate of thirty percent\n(30%) (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred and eighty-three\n(183) days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in\nwhich case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or\na lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital\nlosses of such Non-U.S. Holder\u037e or\n\u2022\nDuck Creek is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is defined in\nSection 897(c) of the Code (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the shorter of the five (5)-year period preceding\nthe Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of Duck Creek\nCommon Stock (the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d) and, if shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are regularly traded on\nan established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S.\nHolder owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than five percent (5%) of Duck\nCreek Common Stock at any time during the Relevant Period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above),\nexcept that the branch profits tax will not apply. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we\nbelieve that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five (5)-year period preceding\nthe Merger.\nNon-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%)) may also apply\nto the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a\nU.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to\nbackup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a\ncertification of such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s foreign status on an applicable IRS Form W-8 (or a\n79\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsubstitute or successor form) or (ii) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or\ncredited against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability\u037e provided that the holder timely furnishes the required\ninformation to the IRS.\nTHE FOREGOING SUMMARY DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME\nTAXATION THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO PARTICULAR HOLDERS. IT IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION\nONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE\nPARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE RECEIPT OF CASH FOR THEIR SHARES OF DUCK\nCREEK COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER UNDER ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, FOREIGN,\nLOCAL OR OTHER TAX LAWS, OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.",

The relief sought in one or more of the Complaints includes\nenjoining the consummation of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material\ninformation, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the terms thereof,\ngranting rescissory damages, directing the defendants to\n \n80\n TABLE OF CONTENTS\ndisseminate a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all required\nor necessary material facts, directing the defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result of the\ndefendants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing, declaring that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act\nas well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and awarding the plaintiffs their respective costs and disbursements,\nincluding reasonable attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees and expenses.\nDuck Creek believes that the Complaints are without merit and Duck Creek and the individual defendants intend\nto defend against the Complaints\u037e however, Duck Creek cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be\nrequired to resolve the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.\nThe outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or\ndelay consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Duck Creek, including any costs associated with\nthe indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no\ntemporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the\nMerger will be in effect, nor will any action have been taken by any governmental authority (as defined in the Merger\nAgreement) of competent jurisdiction, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been enacted, entered\nenforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation\nof the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the\nMerger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated, or from\nbeing consummated within the expected time frame.\n \n81\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT",

The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not\nconstitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in\nSection 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock\nunless otherwise expressly noted therein or herein, and all such references to a \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d mean a person\nwho is the beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on\nbehalf of such person unless otherwise expressly noted therein or herein.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is consummated, stockholders and beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common\nStock who (i) deliver a written demand for appraisal of their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock before the taking of\nthe vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) do not vote in favor of the Merger, (iii) continuously\nhold of record or beneficially own, as applicable of such shares through the Effective Time, and (iv) otherwise follow\nthe procedures set forth in Section 262, will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and\nto receive in lieu of the Merger Consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to\nbe the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair\nvalue as determined by the Court of Chancery (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash\npayments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262). Unless the Court of\nChancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue\nand compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period\u037e\nprovided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving\nCorporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of\nsuch payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and\nthe \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of\nsuch voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such\nvoluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking\nappraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more\nthan, the same as or less than the $19.00 per share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement\nif they did not seek appraisal of their shares.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to\nappraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice either a copy of Section 262 or information\ndirecting the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without\nsubscription or cost. This Proxy Statement constitutes Duck Creek\u2019s notice to Company stockholders that appraisal\nrights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed,\nwithout subscription or cost, at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the Merger, any holder or beneficial\nowner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve\nsuch person\u2019s right to do so should review the following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully.\nFailure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of\nappraisal rights under the DGCL. In addition, the Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all\nCompany stockholders and beneficial owners who assert appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of\nDuck Creek Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one percent (1%) of\nthe outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL or (ii) the value of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Duck Creek Common\nStock for which appraisal rights have been\n106TABLE OF CONTENTS\npursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek\nappraisal of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, Duck Creek believes that if a Company stockholder or beneficial\nowner is considering exercising appraisal rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel. A Company\nstockholder or beneficial owner who loses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger\nConsideration as described in the Merger Agreement upon surrender of the certificates that formerly represented\nsuch shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.\nCompany stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of\nDuck Creek Common Stock must fully comply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\nthe person must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe person must deliver to Duck Creek a written demand for appraisal before the vote on proposal to adopt\nthe Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and\nseparate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement.\nVoting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a\ndemand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform\nus of the identity of the stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, and the intention of such person to\ndemand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner's failure to make a written\ndemand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is taken will constitute a waiver of\nappraisal rights\u037e\n\u2022\nthe person must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective\nTime (a stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers\nthe shares before the Effective Time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe person, another stockholder or beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal rights or the\nSurviving Corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair\nvalue of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time. The Surviving\nCorporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nIf you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive\nthe Merger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Duck Creek Common\nStock.\nBecause a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in\nfavor of proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, abstain or not vote its shares.\nMaking a Written Demand",

            "text": "Making a Written Demand\nAny holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must\ndeliver to Duck Creek, before the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, a\nwritten demand for the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner shares. The person making the written\ndemand must be a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner, as applicable, on the date the written demand for\nappraisal is made, and such person must continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, the shares as to which\nsuch demand relates through the effective date of the Merger.\nA person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt\nthe Merger Agreement either by ballot or by proxy. In the case of a holder of record shares of Duck Creek Common\nStock a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and it will cause a stockholder to lose the stockholder\u2019s right to appraisal\nand will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy\nand who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the proposal\nto adopt the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In the case\nof a beneficial owner, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote\n107TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthose shares on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement without specific voting instructions from the beneficial\nowner on such proposal, but such brokers, banks or other nominees will vote such shares as instructed if the\nbeneficial owner provides such instructions. If a beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d instructs such\nperson's broker, bank or other nominee to vote such person's shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, and does not revoke such instruction prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,\nthen such shares will be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will cause such beneficial\nowner to lose his, her or its right to appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.\nTherefore, a beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must either not provide any instructions to such\nperson's broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or must instruct\nsuch broker, bank or other nominee to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on\nsuch proposal. Neither voting against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or\nfailing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for\nappraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and\nseparate from any proxy or vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s failure\nto make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the\nSpecial Meeting will cause such person to lose its appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.\nA demand for appraisal made by a Company stockholder or beneficial owner should be executed by or on behalf\nof the holder of record or beneficial owner, as applicable, and must reasonably inform Duck Creek of the identity of\nsuch stockholder or beneficial owner. In addition, in the case of a demand for appraisal of such beneficial owner, the\ndemand must also (1) reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (2) be\naccompanied by documentary evidence of the beneficial owner\u2019s ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or\nsecurities account statement containing such information or a letter from the broker or other record holder of such\nshares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of\nwhat it purports to be and (3) provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given\nby the Surviving Corporation under Section 262 and the verified list required by subsection (f) of Section 262\n(discussed further below). Whether made by a Company stockholder or a beneficial owner, a written demand for\nappraisal must state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the person's shares in connection with\nthe Merger. If the shares are held of record or beneficially owned in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,\nguardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of such holder of record or beneficial owner,\nand if the shares are held of record or beneficially owned by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or a\ntenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all such joint holders of record or beneficial\nowners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint stockholders or beneficial owners,\nmay execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record or beneficial owner\u037e however, the agent must\nidentify the record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners, respectively, and should expressly disclose that,\nin executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners,\nas applicable.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be mailed or delivered to:\nDuck Creek Technologies, Inc.\n22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10\nBoston, MA 02210\nAttention: Secretary\nAny holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock who has delivered a written demand to\nDuck Creek and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may\nwithdraw his or her or its demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person's shares and accept the\nMerger Consideration with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal by delivering to Duck Creek a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.

If a petition for\nappraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The Surviving Corporation is under no\nobligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and Company stockholders and beneficial owners\nshould not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the\nfair values of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Accordingly, any holders or beneficial owners of Duck Creek\nCommon Stock who desire to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery should assume that they will be\nresponsible for filing a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The\nfailure of a holder or beneficial owner of Duck Creek Common Stock to file such a petition for appraisal within the\nperiod specified in Section 262 will nullify the person\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck\nCreek Common Stock who has complied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, will be entitled,\nupon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of\nshares not voted in favor of the Merger proposal and with respect to which Duck Creek received demands for\nappraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares of such\ncommon stock (provided that, in the case of a demand made by a beneficial owner in such person's name, the record\nholder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such\naggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting person within ten (10) days\nafter receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for\ndelivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock\nand a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within\ntwenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the\nnames and addresses of all persons who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to\nthe value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders and beneficial owners as required\nby the court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those persons\nwho have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of\nChancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the\nRegister in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to\ncomply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.",

            "text": "Determination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the persons entitled to appraisal the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance\nwith the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Court\nof Chancery will appraise the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, exclusive of any element of\nvalue arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the\n109TABLE OF CONTENTS\namount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery of will take into account all\nrelevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be\nconsidered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or\nmethods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the\nvalue of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court\nmust consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other\nfacts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant factors the Court\nof Chancery may consider in determining \u201cfair value\u201d and that absent deficiencies in the sale process the transaction\nprice should be given \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element\nof value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the\nSupreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known\nelements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future\nvalue, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and\nnot the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their\nshares as so determined by the Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration\nthey would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an\ninvestment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is\nnot an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Duck\nCreek believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of\nfair value as determined by the Court of Chancery, and stockholders and beneficial owners should recognize that\nsuch an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger\nConsideration. Neither Duck Creek nor Parent anticipates offering more than the $19.00 per share Merger\nConsideration to any person exercising appraisal rights. Each of Duck Creek and Parent reserves the right to assert, in\nany appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Duck Creek Common Stock\nis less than the $19.00 per share Merger Consideration.\nUnless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the\nEffective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five\npercent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during\nthe period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment\u037e provided that if at any time before\nthe Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation pays to each\nstockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the\namount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares\nas determined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment,\nunless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment\nprior to such entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the\nfees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of\nChancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may\nalso order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including,\nwithout limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the\nvalue of all the shares entitled to be appraised not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to\nsuch an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.\nIf any stockholder or beneficial owner who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Duck Creek Common\nStock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, the\nperson\u2019s shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the\nMerger Consideration, less applicable withholding taxes. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw,\nthe person\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred\n110\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntwenty (120) days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, delivers to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the person\u2019s demand for appraisal in respect to some or all of such\nperson\u2019s shares and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares subject to withdrawal in\naccordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Duck\nCreek Common Stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except\ndividends or other distributions on the person\u2019s shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, if any, payable to Company\nstockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of statutory\nappraisal rights. Consequently, any Company stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is\nencouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\nSTOCKHOLDERS AND BENEFICIAL OWNERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF\nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT\nTHERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.\nOTHER MATTERS",

Subject, in all cases, to the terms and conditions of the Charter in respect of\nCompany Capital Stock, if a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock is not registered in the\nstock transfer books or ledger of the Company or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in\nwhich the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in\nthe stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the\nPerson in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or transferred is registered in the\nstock transfer books or ledger of the Company, as applicable, only if, in the case of Company Capital Shares\nrepresented by Certificates, such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and\ntransfer, or in the case of Uncertificated Shares, a proper transfer instruction is presented, and in either case the\nPerson requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes\nrequired by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such\nCertificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer\nTaxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.\n(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the\nPayment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of\nCompany Capital Stock, for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned\nproperty, escheat or similar law.\n(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains\nundistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the\nClosing Date, as applicable, will be delivered to Parent (as directed by Parent) upon demand, and any holders of\nshares of Company Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, who\nhave not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such\nshares of Company Capital Stock, for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of\nthe Per Share Price without interest thereon, payable in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock\nrepresented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property,\nescheat or similar laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price, to which such\nholders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such\nCertificates or Uncertificated Shares two years after the Closing Date, or at such earlier date as is immediately\nprior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental\nAuthority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free\nand clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal\nrepresentatives) previously entitled thereto.",

Although the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary\ndamages, under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific\nperformance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages (including any monetary\ndamages in lieu of specific performance).\n(b) Specific Performance.\n(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would\nnot be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this\nAgreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to\nconsummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.\nThe Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 8.6, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition\nto any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance\nand other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce\nspecifically the terms and provisions hereof\u037e (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do\nnot adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, for the\nharm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise\nimpair in any respect any Party\u2019s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief\u037e and\n(C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the\nCompany nor the Buyer Parties would have entered into this Agreement. It is explicitly agreed that the\nCompany shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in\nconnection with enforcing the Buyer Parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the Equity\nFinancing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the\nGuarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely\ncompleted in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment\nLetter). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive agreements\nfor any Debt Financing under the terms thereof, none of the Company and its Affiliates and their direct and\nindirect equityholders shall have any rights or claims (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) against\nany Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the\nDebt Financing, and in no event shall the Company, any of its Affiliates or its or their direct or indirect\nequityholders be entitled to directly seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against any\nFinancing Source.\nA-74TABLE OF CONTENTS\n(ii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific\nperformance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this\nAgreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand\u037e and (B) the specific\nperformance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,\nor to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Buyer Parties pursuant to\nthis Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,\nspecific performance or any other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy\nat law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in\nequity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to\nenforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or\nother security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any\nright that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.",
