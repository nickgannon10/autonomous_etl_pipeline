However, abstaining\nor voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement is not in itself sufficient to perfect appraisal rights because additional actions must also be taken to\nperfect such rights.

These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a holder of Poshmark common stock. You should\nread the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in\nthis proxy statement.\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\nOn October 3, 2022, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Poshmark, with Poshmark surviving as an indirect subsidiary of Parent.\nYou are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Poshmark Board in favor of the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement and the other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting as described in this proxy statement.\nAs a holder of Poshmark common stock, what will I receive in the Merger?\nEach share of Poshmark common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Poshmark\ncommon stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Proton Parent and Merger Sub) immediately\nprior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the\nDGCL) will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding\ntaxes.\nThe exchange of shares of Poshmark common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d for a more detailed\ndescription of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You are urged to consult your tax advisor for a full understanding of how the\nMerger will affect you for federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. tax purposes.\nHow does the Merger Consideration compare to the recent trading price of Poshmark common stock?\nThe Merger Consideration of $17.90 per share represents a premium of approximately 15% of Poshmark\u2019s Class A common stock closing share price\non October 3, 2022, the date of the transaction announcement, a 34% premium to the 30-day volume weighted average price of Poshmark\u2019s Class A\ncommon stock as of October 3, 2022 (\u201cVWAP\u201d), and a 48% premium to the 90-day VWAP. On November 21, 2022, the most recent practicable date before\nthe filing of this proxy statement, the closing price of Poshmark common stock was $17.78 per share.\nWhat will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the Merger and purchase rights under the 2021 ESPP?\nAt the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option to purchase shares of Company Class A common stock or Class B common stock (a\n\u201cCompany Option\u201d) that is vested (including such Company Options that vest in accordance with their terms as a result of the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) (a \u201cVested Company Option\u201d) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price\nper share less than $17.90 will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to\napplicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to\nsuch Vested Company Option\n \n-11-Table of Contents\nand (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option.

The inspector of election appointed for the Special\nMeeting will determine whether a quorum is present. The inspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence\nof a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the adjournment or postponement of the\nmeeting to another date or time.\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?\nThe approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares\nof Poshmark common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record date. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special\nMeeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder\u2019s bank,\nbroker or other nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nThe approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares\nof Poshmark common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on such matter. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the\nSpecial Meeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder\u2019s\nbank, broker or other nominee) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nThe holders of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all proposals\ndescribed in this proxy statement. On each of the proposals presented at the Special Meeting, each holder of Class A common stock is entitled to one (1)\nvote for each outstanding share of Class A common stock owned on the record date and each holder of Class B common stock is entitled to ten (10)\nvotes for each outstanding share of Class B common stock owned on the record date on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting.\nWhat is a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d? \nIf a beneficial owner of shares of Poshmark common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a bank, broker or other nominee does not provide the\norganization that holds the owner\u2019s shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the organization that holds the owner\u2019s shares\nmay generally vote on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d matters but cannot vote on \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d matters. A so-called \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d results when banks,\nbrokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not\nvote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions\nfrom the beneficial owner of relevant shares. Poshmark does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to\nbanks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of\nthe proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be permitted to vote\nyour shares of Poshmark common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to\nhow to vote your shares of Poshmark common stock will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but\nwill have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.\n \n-14-\nTable of Contents\nHow does the Poshmark Board recommend that I vote?\nThe Poshmark Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Poshmark Board considered in determining to recommend that Poshmark stockholders adopt the Merger\nAgreement, please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Poshmark Board.\u201d In\naddition, in considering the recommendation of the Poshmark Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that certain of the\nCompany\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders\ngenerally. Please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Poshmark common stock before the Special Meeting?\nThe record date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you sell or transfer your shares of Poshmark common\nstock after the record date, but before the Special Meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the Special Meeting. However, the right to\nreceive the Merger Consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred your shares.

Your bank, broker or other nominee will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by\nproperly completing the voting instruction form sent to you by your bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement. Without providing those\ninstructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the\noutcome of the Adjournment Proposal.\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?\nIf you abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf you fail to cast your vote via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy or fail to give voting instructions to your broker, it will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal, provided that a quorum is\npresent at the Special Meeting.\nCan I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or my voting instructions?\nYes.

This review at times includes, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions and other\nfinancial and strategic alternatives.\nOn January 4, 2022, a member of the Board introduced Manish Chandra, Poshmark\u2019s co-founder and CEO, to representatives of NAVER to explore a\npotential commercial partnership between the companies involving (i) the expansion of Poshmark\u2019s business into South Korea and potentially Japan and\nNAVER\u2019s entry into U.S. markets and (ii) a potential private investment in Poshmark\u2019s public equity by NAVER (such partnership and investment referred\nto together as the \u201cpotential commercial partnership and investment\u201d).\nOn January 12, 2022, the Company and NAVER entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement to further explore the potential commercial\npartnership and investment. Such non-disclosure agreement did not contain any standstill or employee non-solicitation provisions. Following the\nexecution of the non-disclosure agreement, Poshmark management proceeded to conduct multiple due diligence sessions with representatives of NAVER.\nOn January 27, 2022, certain members of the Board met with representatives from Goldman Sachs and representatives of Financial Advisor A and\nFinancial Advisor B in connection with the Company\u2019s ongoing review of potential strategic alternatives.\nOn February 2, 2022 and February 10, 2022, representatives of NAVER and Poshmark management initiated discussions around the framework for\nthe potential commercial partnership and investment.\nOn February 16, 2022, NAVER submitted an initial proposal for the potential commercial partnership and investment, which proposal included a\npreliminary $125 million investment structured as a convertible preferred security. From February 16, 2022 until August 5, 2022, when, as described below,\nNAVER first submitted an initial non-binding proposal to acquire all outstanding Company common stock, the parties continued to negotiate the key\nterms of a potential commercial partnership and investment.\n \n-32-Table of Contents\nOn March 4, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs,\nFinancial Advisor A and Goodwin Procter LLP, Poshmark\u2019s outside counsel (\u201cGoodwin\u201d), in attendance for portions of the meeting. The Board discussed\nthe potential commercial partnership and investment with NAVER, and determined that it would be advisable to engage a financial advisor in order to\nassist in the evaluation of the potential commercial partnership and investment and other potential strategic alternatives. The Board met with\nrepresentatives from Goldman Sachs and Financial Advisor A to assess each firm as a potential advisor to the Company in connection with such\nevaluation. Following discussion, the Board determined to proceed with the formal engagement of Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor, noting\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which Poshmark operates and experience advising technology companies in\nconnection with potential strategic transactions. On the basis of these considerations, and subject in all respects to the Board\u2019s review of a customary\nrelationships disclosure to be produced by Goldman Sachs, the Board authorized Poshmark management and Goodwin to negotiate the terms of an\nengagement letter for the purpose of engaging Goldman Sachs.\nOn March 27, 2022, representatives of NAVER had a follow-up call with Poshmark management regarding Poshmark\u2019s Q4 2021 earnings.\nOn March 28, 2022, at the request of the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided customary relationship disclosures to Poshmark, and\nsuch disclosure was promptly shared with the Board and included disclosure of certain relationships between Goldman Sachs and representatives thereof\non the one hand and NAVER, Mayfield Fund, L.L.C., and certain other parties and their respective affiliates, on the other hand. A summary of such\nrelationships is set forth in the section titled \u201cOpinion of Goldman Sachs.\u201d\nOn April 1, 2022, after review and consultation with the Board and with the Board\u2019s unanimous approval, the Company signed a formal engagement\nletter with Goldman Sachs in connection with the Company\u2019s evaluation of a potential strategic transaction, including the potential commercial\npartnership and investment with NAVER.\nOn April 13, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, at the Board\u2019s direction, and representatives of NAVER\u2019s financial advisor, LionTree LLC\n(\u201cLionTree\u201d), initiated discussions on the topic of a minority equity investment.\nOn May 2, 2022, NAVER management met with members of Poshmark management at Poshmark\u2019s headquarters to present an overview of NAVER\u2019s\nbusiness. Following the meeting, a representative of NAVER indicated to Mr. Chandra that NAVER was interested in potentially engaging in a broader\nstrategic transaction with Poshmark in the form of an acquisition of all outstanding Company common stock (such potential strategic transaction\ninvolving Poshmark and NAVER, the \u201cproposed transaction\u201d). Mr. Chandra stated he was not in a position to respond to such interest at such time, given\nthe Board had only previously discussed a potential commercial partnership and investment with NAVER. Following the discussion, Mr. Chandra gave an\nupdate regarding such expression of interest to certain members of the Board.\nOn May 6, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nGoodwin in attendance. Mr. Chandra provided the Board a status update on discussions with NAVER regarding the potential commercial partnership and\ninvestment and informed the Board of NAVER\u2019s interest in potentially engaging in a broader strategic transaction with Poshmark in the form of an\nacquisition of all outstanding Company common stock. The Board also discussed that it would need to evaluate Poshmark\u2019s long-range plan, the current\nvalue of Poshmark and available strategic opportunities before agreeing to a potential commercial partnership and investment with NAVER or pursuing\nother strategic alternatives. Accordingly, in order to be able to fully assess Poshmark\u2019s standalone prospects and potential, and to be able to better\nevaluate such prospects and potential relative to the potential commercial partnership and investment and/or other potential strategic alternatives, the\nBoard authorized Poshmark management to develop a standalone long-range plan using the best up-to-date information then available.\n \n-33-\nTable of Contents\nOn May 10, during a call between representatives NAVER and Mr. Chandra to discuss the investment process, representatives of NAVER again\nraised the idea of a full acquisition. Mr. Chandra requested that NAVER continue to focus on the potential commercial partnership and investment.\nFrom May 25, 2022 through June 23, 2022, members of Poshmark management and NAVER management held multiple meetings during which the\nteams presented overviews of their respective businesses and focused on exploring a potential commercial partnership and investment, especially on\njoint market opportunity in Korea, the live shopping business and the Japan market.\nOn June 14, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of Poshmark management in attendance. Mr. Chandra provided an\nupdate on Poshmark\u2019s long-range plan and led a discussion on key assumptions made in preparing the long-range plan. The Board also discussed the\nmethodology and investment assumptions and provided feedback on the long-range plan.\nOn July 5, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goodwin also in attendance. Mr. Chandra\nprovided a status update regarding the potential commercial partnership and investment and recent interactions with NAVER, including NAVER\u2019s\ncontinued interest in a potential acquisition of Poshmark. Representatives of Goodwin presented an overview of the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under\nDelaware law and discussed certain considerations for the Board when undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of\nthe Company. The members of Poshmark management also presented certain unaudited financial forecasts for Poshmark for fiscal years 2022 through\n2025 (the \u201cCompany LRP\u201d), which Poshmark management extrapolated through fiscal year 2032, and certain forecasts related to the expected utilization\nby the Company of certain net operating loss carryforwards (the \u201cTax Attributes Forecasts\u201d and together with the Company LRP and extrapolations, the\n\u201cManagement Projections\u201d), which had been prepared at the request of the Board in connection with the Board\u2019s review of strategic alternatives.\nPoshmark management noted that the Company LRP assumes certain keys to growth and continuous improvement in buyer conversion and spend,\ngrowing AUs, seller conversion and monetization, and does not reflect the impact of a potential partnership with NAVER given the early stage of the\nparties\u2019 discussion around the framework for and key terms of the potential commercial partnership and investment and lack of agreement on any material\nterms. Poshmark management also discussed the market environment and underscored in their presentation the challenges facing the Company noting\ncertain key execution risks of the standalone plan, including the growth of active user retention or active buyer conversion in part driven by the\nintroduction of new rules or technology disruptions, major changes in the competitive or regulatory landscape and the challenges of gaining a foothold\nin another country. Poshmark management also discussed Poshmark\u2019s livestreaming and live auctions initiative, which Poshmark described as an\nopportunity to reinvent selling by making live selling available to everyone and to integrate live selling into Poshmark\u2019s other initiatives such as\nPoshmark parties. Poshmark management noted that this initiative could potentially be a significant revenue generator and growth opportunity for\nPoshmark. Poshmark management also noted, however, that while Poshmark was aiming to begin the new initiative in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022,\nthe initiative was still being conceptualized, and therefore it was untested and too speculative at that point to reasonably reflect any potential revenue,\ncosts and other financial metrics associated with such initiative in the projections being reviewed and approved by the Board. Poshmark management and\nthe Board discussed the initiative and the potential opportunity associated therewith, and the Board concurred with Poshmark management\u2019s view to not\ninclude such initiative in the projections given the speculative nature of any potential revenue, costs, and other financial metrics associated with the\ninitiative. The Board directed Poshmark management to present information on such initiative to NAVER as part of NAVER\u2019s due diligence and\nassessment of potential growth drivers such information was subsequently provided to NAVER during the due diligence meetings described below.\nFollowing discussion, the Board approved the Company LRP and directed Poshmark management to share the Management Projections with Goldman\nSachs for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses in connection with the Board\u2019s evaluation of any potential strategic transaction, including both\nthe potential commercial partnership and investment and potential acquisition of Poshmark by NAVER, and if requested, with NAVER for purposes of\nNAVER\u2019s evaluation of a potential acquisition of Poshmark. The Management Projections are more fully described in the section titled\n \n-34-\nTable of Contents\n\u201cCertain Financial Projections.\u201d The directors were then invited to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest they may have in relation to\nNAVER and its affiliates and each of the directors confirmed that such director is independent from and does not have a relationship with NAVER or its\naffiliates. The Board also authorized Poshmark management, certain members of the Board and representatives of Goldman Sachs to continue to engage\nin discussions with NAVER and its advisors regarding the potential commercial partnership and investment, noting that consistent with the Board\u2019s\nconsideration of various strategic and other opportunities available to Poshmark and its fiduciary duties, the Board would be willing to review a proposal\nsubmitted by NAVER if NAVER remained interested in a potential acquisition of Poshmark.\nOn July 19, 2022 and July 20, 2022, Poshmark held in-person diligence sessions with NAVER management (with representatives of LionTree in\nattendance), at Poshmark\u2019s headquarters with respect to the potential commercial partnership and investment. From July 21, 2022 to August 2, 2022,\nmembers of Poshmark management and NAVER management held multiple follow-up due diligence meetings.\nOn August 2, 2022, Mr. Chandra and a NAVER representative spoke by phone, during which NAVER reaffirmed its interest in an acquisition of all\noutstanding Company common stock. Mr. Chandra indicated the Board\u2019s willingness to review a proposal for the proposed transaction and requested\nthat NAVER submit a formal proposal if it remained interested in an acquisition. Both parties also agreed at that point that the potential commercial\npartnership and investment did not meet either party\u2019s objectives at that point and discussions with respect to potential commercial partnership and\ninvestment were subsequently terminated.\nOn August 3, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goodwin also in\nattendance. Among other things, the Board discussed adopting resolutions forming a transaction committee of the Board (the \u201cTransaction Committee\u201d)\nto consider, review and evaluate any proposals made with respect to the potential commercial partnership and investment as well as any other potential\nstrategic alternative or alternatives thereto, including, without limitation, Poshmark continuing to operate as an independent, publicly traded company.\nThe Board discussed that the Transaction Committee was being formed for expediency of process, and not in response to any conflict of interest in\nrelation to NAVER and its affiliates. The Board then adopted resolutions forming the Transaction Committee and appointed Mr. Navin Chaddha, Mr. Hans\nTung, and Mr. Jeff Epstein, each an independent director, to the Transaction Committee and approved the reimbursement of all reasonable expenses\nincurred by such directors in connection with their service on the Transaction Committee.\nOn August 5, 2022, NAVER submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire Poshmark for $16.50 per share in cash (the \u201cAugust 5 proposal\u201d).\nThe $16.50 per share offer price implied a premium to Poshmark\u2019s closing price on August 4, 2022 of approximately 38.7%. The August 5 proposal noted\nthat it was not subject to any financing condition and that at the appropriate time and with the approval of the Board, NAVER would like to discuss the\npossibility of a rollover investment by a limited group of stockholders. NAVER also expressed the view that the retention of Poshmark\u2019s current\nmanagement and employees is critical to the future success of the business and they are important stakeholders in the potential transaction, and\ntherefore at the appropriate time and with the approval of the Board, NAVER would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential go-forward incentive\nand alignment arrangements with Poshmark management. Poshmark\u2019s management, including Mr. Chandra, was directed by the Board not to, and they did\nnot, discuss any post-transaction employment or compensation terms for Poshmark management with any potential acquirers, with the sole exception\nthat Mr. Chandra began such discussions with representatives of NAVER with the Board\u2019s approval on September 22, 2022, as discussed below. In\naddition, Poshmark\u2019s management team, including Mr. Chandra, was directed by the Board not to, and they did not, discuss any potential rollover\ninvestment in any potential acquirers. The August 5 proposal also included a request that Mr. Chandra, certain entities affiliated with Menlo Ventures,\nMayfield XIII, Mayfield Select, GGV Capital V L.P. and GGV Capital V Entrepreneurs Fund L.P. would be required to sign voting agreements and a request\nfor a 30-day exclusivity period.\n \n-35-\nTable of Contents\nOn August 6, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nGoodwin also in attendance. Mr. Chandra provided the Transaction Committee with a status update regarding the potential transaction with NAVER and\nrecent interactions with NAVER, noting that NAVER had submitted a non-binding proposal on August 5 to acquire Poshmark for $16.50 per share, and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed a summary of the material financial and economic aspects of NAVER\u2019s proposal. The August 5 proposal was\nprovided to the Transaction Committee prior to the meeting. Representatives of Goodwin discussed certain key terms that would be applicable to a\npotential transaction with NAVER. The Transaction Committee and its advisors discussed potential responses to NAVER\u2019s August 5 proposal, and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed a list of strategic and financial sponsor counterparties to be considered by the Transaction Committee for\ninclusion in a potential market check, if the Board decided to conduct a market check. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee authorized Mr.\nChandra to revert to NAVER to confirm receipt of the August 5 proposal and note that the Board would need to discuss and evaluate the proposal.\nLater on August 6, 2022, as authorized by the Transaction Committee, Mr. Chandra called a representative of NAVER and conveyed that the Board\nwould meet to discuss and evaluate the August 5 proposal.\nOn August 7, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin in\nattendance for a portion of the meeting. Mr. Chandra provided the Board with a status update regarding the potential transaction with NAVER, including\na discussion of recent interactions with NAVER and the August 5 proposal. Representatives of Goodwin again presented an overview of the directors\u2019\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law and discussed certain considerations for the Board when undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives,\nincluding a potential sale of the Company. The Board and its advisors then discussed the importance of understanding the Company LRP and the role\nthat the Company LRP would play in the preliminary financial analyses to be performed by Goldman Sachs, at the Board\u2019s direction. The Board and its\nadvisors also discussed a potential pre-signing market check and the implications of entering into exclusivity with NAVER at this time. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs reviewed a summary of key financial and economic terms of the August 5 proposal and the Board and its advisors discussed potential\nresponses to NAVER, as well as considerations related to the timing and scope for a potential pre-signing market check. Representatives of Goldman\nSachs reviewed a potential list of strategic and financial sponsor parties for the Board\u2019s consideration and the Board and its advisors discussed the risks\nof leaks and management distraction based on the scope of the market check. Following discussion, the Board (i) directed Mr. Chandra, to revert to and\nencourage NAVER to submit an improved offer to improve NAVER\u2019s chances of receiving a positive reaction from the Board to their proposal, and to\nindicate that the revised proposal would have to be \u201cin the $20s\u201d for the Board\u2019s consideration as an effort to obtain a higher offer from NAVER, (ii)\napproved and reaffirmed the Company LRP, which was initially approved by the Board on July 5, 2022, and directed Goldman Sachs to use the\nManagement Projections for the preparation of its preliminary financial analyses and (iii) authorized a pre-signing market check consistent with the\nManagement Projections for the preparation of its preliminary financial analyses and (iii) authorized a pre-signing market check consistent with the\ndiscussion between the Board and representatives of Goldman Sachs, with the Transaction Committee determining the specific timing and scope of a pre-\nsigning market check, and authorized representatives of Goldman Sachs to conduct such market check under the guidance of the Transaction Committee.\nImmediately following the meeting, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of\nGoodwin also in attendance. The Transaction Committee and its advisors discussed the counterparties to be contacted in the pre-signing market check,\nand subsequent to the meeting, the Transaction Committee directed representatives of Goldman Sachs to contact four strategic counterparties (referred to\nherein as \u201cStrategic Party A\u201d, \u201cStrategic Party B\u201d, \u201cStrategic Party C\u201d and \u201cStrategic Party D\u201d) and a financial sponsor counterparty (referred to\nherein as \u201cFinancial Sponsor A\u201d), who the Transaction Committee determined, after its discussions with representatives of Goldman Sachs, were the\nmost likely potential parties to be interested in a transaction with Poshmark. The Transaction Committee and representatives of Goodwin then discussed\nNAVER\u2019s desire to discuss the possibility of a rollover investment by a limited group of stockholders at the appropriate time and with the approval of the\nBoard as indicated in their August 5 proposal, with representatives\n \n-36-\nTable of Contents\nof Goodwin explaining the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under Delaware law and other considerations with respect to any request by NAVER that the\ndirectors or their affiliates participate in a rollover investment. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee directed representatives of Goodwin to\ncontinue to monitor any subsequent proposals by NAVER regarding any rollover investment.\nLater on August 7, 2022, as authorized by the Board, Mr. Chandra called a representative of NAVER and conveyed the message of the Board that (i)\nthe $16.50 per share offer price remained inadequate and (ii) the Board encouraged NAVER to submit an improved offer to improve NAVER\u2019s chances of\nreceiving a positive reaction from the Board to their proposal and the revised proposal would have to be \u201cin the $20s\u201d for the Board\u2019s consideration.\nOn August 8, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs commenced the Company\u2019s pre-signing market check with respect to Financial Sponsor A,\nStrategic Party A, Strategic Party B, Strategic Party C, and Strategic Party D in accordance with the directions of the Board and the Transaction\nCommittee, in each case with the message that the Company was prepared to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the counterparty to enable the\ncounterparty to expeditiously receive access to value-determining due diligence and potentially submit a proposal for a potential transaction.\nOn August 15, 2022, the Company and Financial Sponsor A entered into a non-disclosure agreement that included a standstill provision that\nprohibited Financial Sponsor A, for an agreed-upon period from the date of the agreement, from offering to acquire or acquiring Poshmark, and from\ntaking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, without the prior consent of Poshmark (but did not include a so-called \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d\nprovision), subject to the ability of Financial Sponsor A to make certain confidential proposals to the Company and to certain customary fall-away\nprovisions to the standstill in the event of the entry into, commencement or public announcement of certain change of control transactions involving the\nCompany and any third party.\nLater that day, the Board held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin also in\nattendance. Prior to the meeting, Poshmark had shared with members of Poshmark management certain management guidelines which, among other\nthings, directed Poshmark management not to have any discussions regarding post-closing employment with NAVER until and unless approved and\nauthorized by the Board or a committee thereof. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed its preliminary financial analysis of the Company and the\nproposed $16.50 per share offer price from NAVER, which represented a 40% premium to Poshmark\u2019s closing price on August 12, 2022 (the last full trading\nday prior to the Board meeting), and the Board discussed such analysis. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an update on the pre-signing\nmarket check, noting that a total of five potential counterparties had been contacted, with Financial Sponsor A entering into a non-disclosure agreement\nearlier that day. The Board then discussed the scope of the market check and concurred with the conclusions of the Transaction Committee, with the\nexception that one additional strategic party, Strategic Party E, should be considered for inclusion in the pre-signing market check. The Board directed\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs to include Strategic Party E in the pre-signing market check. The Board and its advisors then discussed potential\nresponses to NAVER and various tactical considerations with respect to such responses, and the Board unanimously authorized Mr. Chandra, to revert to\nNAVER with the message that its revised proposal would have to be \u201csolidly in the $20s\u201d for the Board\u2019s consideration and Mr. Chandra conveyed such\nmessage to representatives of NAVER the following day.\nFrom August 15, 2022 to August 16, 2022, representatives of NAVER traveled to Poshmark\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco to attend in-person\nsessions to discuss growth strategy with Poshmark management. Such representatives of NAVER also met with the lead independent director of the\nBoard to further discuss the potential transaction.\nAlso on August 15, 2022, the Company and Strategic Party D entered into a non-disclosure agreement that included a standstill provision that\nprohibited Strategic Party D, for an agreed-upon period from the date of the\n \n-37-\nTable of Contents\nagreement, from offering to acquire or acquiring Poshmark, and from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, without the prior consent of\nPoshmark. Such non-disclosure agreement contained a so-called \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provision but permitted Strategic Party D to make certain\nconfidential proposals to the Company and was subject to certain customary fall-away provisions to the standstill in the event of the entry into,\ncommencement or public announcement of certain change of control transactions involving the Company and any third party.\nOn August 16, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs reached out to representatives of Strategic Party E as part of the Company\u2019s pre-signing\nmarket check in accordance with the directions of the Board. Also on August 16, 2022, representatives of Strategic Party A and Strategic Party C each\nindicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that such party would not further evaluate a potential transaction with Poshmark at this time.\nFrom August 18, 2022 to August 23, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A, Strategic Party B, Strategic Party D and Strategic Party E\nattended management presentations with Poshmark management, except that representatives of Strategic Party B did not receive any non-public\nconfidential information regarding Poshmark given representatives of Strategic Party B, at Strategic Party B\u2019s request, had not executed a confidentiality\nagreement prior to such presentation. Strategic Party B understood that if it chose to move forward subsequent to such initial meeting, Poshmark would\nrequire a customary confidentiality agreement between the parties.\nOn August 23, 2022, the Company and Strategic Party E entered into a non-disclosure agreement. Such non-disclosure agreement did not contain a\nstandstill provision, but Strategic Party E understood a customary standstill provision would be required if Strategic Party E decided to move forward\nafter the management presentation.\nOn August 24, 2022, representatives of Strategic Party B indicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that such party would not further evaluate\na potential transaction with Poshmark at this time.\nOn August 25, 2022, NAVER submitted a revised non-binding proposal to acquire Poshmark for $17.50 per share in cash (the \u201cAugust 25\nproposal\u201d). The $17.50 per share offer price implied a premium to Poshmark\u2019s closing price on August 24, 2022 of approximately 59.1% and represented a\n6.1% increase on NAVER\u2019s original offer price per share submitted on August 5, 2022. The August 25 proposal again noted that at the appropriate time\nand with the approval of the Board, NAVER would like to discuss the possibility of a rollover investment by a limited group of stockholders and potential\ngo-forward arrangements with Poshmark management, and included a request for a 30-day exclusivity period. Poshmark\u2019s management team, including\nMr. Chandra, was again directed by the Board not to, and they did not, discuss any post-transaction employment or compensation terms for Poshmark\nmanagement with representatives of NAVER, with the sole exception that Mr. Chandra began such discussions with the Board\u2019s approval on September\n22, 2022, as discussed below. In addition, Poshmark\u2019s management team, including Mr. Chandra, was again directed by the Board not to, and they did not,\ndiscuss any potential rollover investment with representatives of NAVER.\nOn August 26, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nGoodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided a status update regarding the Company\u2019s pre-signing market check, noting that\nall of the counterparties included in the market check, other than Financial Sponsor A, had declined to further evaluate a potential transaction with\nPoshmark at this time. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided a status update regarding a potential transaction with NAVER and recent\ninteractions with NAVER, noting that NAVER had submitted the August 25 proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs summarized the material financial\nand economic aspects of NAVER\u2019s revised proposal. The Transaction Committee then discussed tactical considerations relating to the Company\u2019s\npotential responses to NAVER\u2019s revised proposal, including that Poshmark would not entertain exclusivity until the parties were agreed on price, and the\npotential timeline to signing, and following discussion, instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to discuss next steps with representatives of\nLionTree, including with respect to due diligence, and instructed representatives of Goodwin to prepare an initial draft of the merger agreement.\n \n-38-\nTable of Contents\nAlso on August 26, 2022, at Financial Sponsor A\u2019s request, Poshmark management attended a follow-up diligence session with representatives of\nFinancial Sponsor A.\nOn August 27, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin also in\nattendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided a status update regarding the Company\u2019s pre-signing market check, noting that all of the\ncounterparties included in the market check, other than Financial Sponsor A, had declined to further evaluate a potential transaction with Poshmark at\nthis time, explaining that (i) Strategic Party A found the present timing of a potential transaction with Poshmark challenging given internal developments,\n(ii) Strategic Party C, Strategic Party D and Strategic Party E all expressed respect for the platform, but said it was not high enough on their list of M&A\npriorities at that time and (iii) Strategic Party B questioned the strategic fit within its existing portfolio. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided a\nstatus update regarding a potential transaction with NAVER, noting that NAVER had submitted the August 25 proposal. Representatives of Goldman\nSachs reviewed a summary of the material financial and economic aspects of NAVER\u2019s revised proposal. The Board then discussed at length the potential\ntimeline to entering into a definitive agreement with NAVER and next steps in the process, and representatives of Goodwin again provided the Board with\nan overview of the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in their evaluation of a proposed transaction. Representatives of Goodwin also presented a proposed set of\ncertain non-price terms to be reflected in the initial draft of the proposed merger agreement that representatives of Goodwin would send to\nrepresentatives of NAVER\u2019s legal counsel, Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d). Following discussion, the Board unanimously (i) approved moving forward\nwith a potential transaction with NAVER at a price per share at or above $17.50 so long as NAVER completes business diligence in an expedited manner\nand agrees to work towards signing prior to September 21, (ii) authorized Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs to continue to\nnegotiate with NAVER to get the best price available and (iii) authorized representatives of Goodwin to send an initial draft of the merger agreement\nreflecting the non-price terms discussed with the Board. The Board also approved granting NAVER exclusivity for a limited period of time but only after\nNAVER confirms completion of its business diligence and provides a full markup of the merger agreement.\nOn August 27, 2022, Mr. Chandra sent an email to a representative of NAVER indicating that the Board was prepared to move forward with a\nproposed transaction at a price of $18.50 per share.\nOn August 29, 2022, representatives of Goodwin sent to representatives of Kirkland Poshmark\u2019s initial draft of a proposed merger agreement for the\nproposed transaction. Representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland continued to negotiate and revise the merger agreement until the parties\u2019 entry into the\nmerger agreement on October 3, 2022. Representatives of Goodwin also sent to representatives of Kirkland an amendment to the non-disclosure\nagreement entered into by Poshmark and NAVER on January 11, 2022, which amendment included a standstill provision that prohibited NAVER, for an\nagreed-upon period from the date of the amendment, from offering to acquire or acquiring Poshmark, and from taking certain other actions, including\nsoliciting proxies, without the prior consent of Poshmark (but did not include a so-called \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provision), subject to the ability of\nNAVER to make certain confidential proposals to the Company and to certain customary fall-away provisions to the standstill in the event of the entry\ninto or commencement or public announcement of certain change of control transactions involving the Company and any third party. Representatives of\nGoodwin and Kirkland continued to negotiate and revise the amendment to the non-disclosure agreement until the parties\u2019 entry into the amendment on\nSeptember 5, 2022.\nOn August 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, representatives of NAVER and LionTree attended in-person business due diligence sessions at\nPoshmark\u2019s headquarters.\nAlso on August 31, 2022, representatives of Goodwin sent to representatives of Kirkland Poshmark\u2019s initial draft of a voting and support agreement\nto be entered into by certain Poshmark stockholders, including Mr. Chandra, Mayfield XIII, Mayfield Select, GGV Capital V L.P. and GGV Capital V\nEntrepreneurs Fund L.P. Representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland continued to negotiate and revise the voting agreement until execution of the voting\nand support agreements concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement on October 3, 2022.\n \n-39-\nTable of Contents\nOn September 2, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A indicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that such party would not further\nevaluate a potential transaction with Poshmark at this time, noting that if such party were to submit a proposal following completion of diligence, it would\nlikely not be able to offer a meaningful premium. Also on September 2, 2022, representatives of Kirkland delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement\nand other transaction documents to representatives of Goodwin.\nOn September 7, 2022, a representative of NAVER called Mr. Chandra to verbally convey a revised proposal to acquire Poshmark at $17.80 per share\n(the \u201cSeptember 7 proposal\u201d), noting that NAVER was still in the process of conducting due diligence, but was willing to improve its offer to $17.80 to\ncontinue to move the proposed transaction forward and that NAVER did not see any incremental value above $17.80 per share.\nOn September 8, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs\nand Goodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided a status update regarding a potential transaction with NAVER and recent\ninteractions with NAVER, noting that earlier that day, a representative of NAVER had verbally conveyed the September 7 proposal. Representatives of\nGoodwin also reviewed with the Transaction Committee key legal issues reflected in Kirkland\u2019s mark-up of the initial draft merger agreement delivered to\nrepresentatives of Goodwin on September 2, 2022 including (i) an initial outside date of six months following signing, shortened from the initially\nproposed nine months, (ii) a Company termination fee equal to 3.5% of equity value, increased from the initially proposed 2.75% of equity value and (iii)\nthe right of NAVER to terminate the merger agreement and collect the Company termination fee if the Company or the Board materially breaches the no-\nshop provisions of the merger agreement. Representatives of Goodwin discussed such terms with the Transaction Committee. The Transaction Committee\nthen discussed potential responses to NAVER\u2019s September 7 proposal, taking into consideration the $17.80 per share offer price implied a premium to\nPoshmark\u2019s closing price on September 8, 2022 of approximately 56.7%, the fact that the Board had authorized proceeding with a potential transaction\nwith NAVER at a price at or above $17.50 per share, the limited number of outstanding issues in the draft merger agreement, and NAVER\u2019s proposed\ntimeline to entering into a definitive agreement by October 5, 2022. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee agreed it would be willing to move\nforward with a potential transaction with NAVER at a price of $17.80 per share but authorized Mr. Chandra to revert to NAVER with a counterproposal of\n$18.00 per share in order to obtain the best price possible and instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to reach out to representatives of LionTree to\nconvey the same message and also request a firm commitment on the timeline proposed by NAVER to enter into a definitive agreement by October 5,\n2022.\nLater that day, at the Transaction Committee\u2019s direction, representatives of Goldman Sachs called representatives of LionTree to convey a\ncounterproposal at $18.00 per share, in accordance with the guidance of the Transaction Committee.\nOn September 9, 2022, a representative of NAVER called Mr. Chandra to propose a best and final offer of $17.90 per share (the \u201cSeptember 9\nproposal\u201d), subject to the parties entering into an exclusivity arrangement, which Mr. Chandra agreed to as authorized by the Board and the Transaction\nCommittee.\nLater that evening, in accordance with the directions of the Board and the Transaction Committee, representatives of Goodwin sent to\nrepresentatives of Kirkland a markup of the exclusivity agreement. Representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland continued to exchange drafts of the\nexclusivity agreement until the parties\u2019 entry into the exclusivity agreement on September 11, 2022, which granted NAVER exclusivity until September 26,\n2022, subject to an automatic extension of such exclusivity period to 9:30 a.m. (New York time) on October 6, 2022, upon NAVER\u2019s written confirmation of\n(i) the per share offer price pursuant to the September 9 proposal and (ii) an anticipated signing date of no later than October 6, 2022.\nOn September 11, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs\nand Goodwin also in attendance. Mr. Chandra provided an update to the Transaction Committee on his call with a representative of NAVER on September\n9, 2022, during\n \n-40-\nTable of Contents\nwhich the parties agreed to move forward with a potential transaction at $17.90 per share as described above. Representatives of Goodwin also provided\nan update on the ongoing negotiations of (i) the merger agreement, noting that the parties were aligned on path forward with respect to a majority of the\nmaterial issues presented in the current markup of the merger agreement, subject to the Transaction Committee\u2019s approval of such positions, and that the\nparties were otherwise conceptually aligned on the remaining few issues and (ii) the exclusivity agreement, which representatives of Goodwin noted was\nin substantially final form. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee authorized Poshmark management to enter into the exclusivity agreement and\ninstructed representatives of Goodwin to send back to representatives of Kirkland markups of the definitive agreements reflecting the positions\ndiscussed and continue to negotiate such agreements. Over the course of the ensuing period of time until the parties entered into the merger agreement\non October 3, 2022, the parties finalized their negotiation of the terms of the merger agreement and related ancillary documents pertaining to the proposed\ntransaction, with the representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland continuing to exchange drafts of such documents.\nThroughout this period of discussions and negotiations, NAVER continued a detailed due diligence review of Poshmark, including without\nlimitation through access to extensive business, financial, accounting, tax, intellectual property and legal related documentation made available in an\nelectronic data room. From September 11, 2022 to September 20, 2022, Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin\nproceeded to conduct multiple additional due diligence management sessions with representatives of NAVER and its third party advisors. Poshmark\nmanagement and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin also continued to respond to NAVER\u2019s due diligence requests until the parties\u2019 entry\ninto the merger agreement on October 3, 2022.\nSubsequent to the parties agreeing on valuation and the material non-financial transaction terms as a basis for moving forward towards a potential\ntransaction, on September 17, 2022, representatives of Kirkland requested that NAVER be permitted to initiate discussions with Mr. Chandra regarding Mr.\nChandra\u2019s potential post-closing employment with NAVER and the terms thereof. Representatives of Kirkland stated NAVER\u2019s position that such\ndiscussions and agreement with respect to post-closing employment terms for Mr. Chandra would be a condition to signing a definitive agreement with\nrespect to the proposed transaction.\nOn September 19, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management, at the request of the Board and\nTransaction Committee, and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided a status\nupdate regarding the potential transaction with NAVER and recent interactions with NAVER and LionTree. The Transaction Committee and its advisors\ndiscussed recent trading patterns in Poshmark common stock, particularly relative to peers and the broader market since entering into exclusivity with\nNAVER. Representatives of Goodwin then provided an update on the various transaction documents being negotiated with NAVER, noting that the\nparties were in agreement on all material terms. Representatives of Goodwin also noted NAVER\u2019s request to initiate discussions with Mr. Chandra\nregarding Mr. Chandra\u2019s potential post-closing employment with NAVER and the terms thereof. Following extensive discussion, and in light of the parties\nhaving agreed on valuation and the material non-financial transaction terms as a basis for moving forward towards a potential transaction, the\nTransaction Committee unanimously authorized Mr. Chandra to have such discussions with NAVER, subject to (i) Mr. Chandra providing timely updates\non any such discussions to representatives of Goodwin which representatives of Goodwin would communicate to the Transaction Committee and the\nBoard and (ii) Mr. Chandra retaining his own legal counsel. Mr. Chandra retained his own legal counsel on September 14, 2022, and between September\n22, 2022, and October 3, 2022, Mr. Chandra negotiated his post-closing compensatory arrangements with NAVER and arrived at an agreement on such\nterms (see the section titled \u201cNew Arrangements with Company Executive Officers\u201d). Prior to these developments and negotiations commencing on\nSeptember 22, 2022, Mr. Chandra did not discuss the terms of his potential post-closing employment or compensation with any representatives of\nNAVER.\nOn September 26, 2022, representatives of Kirkland delivered NAVER\u2019s written confirmation of (i) the per share offer price pursuant to the\nSeptember 9 proposal and (ii) an anticipated signing date of no later than October 6, 2022, extending the exclusivity period to 9:30 a.m. (New York time) on\nOctober 6, 2022.\n \n-41-\nTable of Contents\nOn September 28, 2022, NAVER submitted a proposal for Mr. Chandra\u2019s post-closing compensation arrangements. Over the course of the ensuing\nperiod of time until the parties entered into the merger agreement on October 3, 2022, Mr. Chandra and NAVER finalized their negotiation of the terms of\nthe binding employee term sheet and holdback agreement, described in further detail in the section titled \u201cNew Arrangements with Company Executive\nOfficers.\u201d\nOn October 2, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nGoodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goodwin provided a general update on the status of the various transaction documents as well as the\nongoing discussions between Mr. Chandra and NAVER regarding his post-closing employment and compensation arrangement. The Transaction\nCommittee and its advisors then discussed the recent trading performance of Poshmark common stock, particularly relative to peers and the broader\nmarket since entering into exclusivity with NAVER and representatives of Goldman Sachs also reviewed its preliminary financial analysis of the Company\nand NAVER\u2019s proposed $17.90 per share offer price. Representatives of Goodwin also provided an update on Mr. Chandra\u2019s discussions with NAVER\nregarding his post-closing employment and compensation arrangement and noted that representatives of Goodwin have been kept apprised of and\nincluded in many of those discussions. The Transaction Committee then held an executive session during which members asked questions regarding the\nkey terms of Mr. Chandra\u2019s post-closing employment and compensation arrangement and timing of negotiations.\nOn October 3, 2022, the Board met to review the final terms of the proposed definitive agreement between Poshmark and NAVER and related\nancillary documents, copies of which were provided to the Board in advance of the meeting, and to vote on whether to approve entry into the proposed\ndefinitive agreement with NAVER. Members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin also attended the meeting.\nRepresentatives of Goodwin reviewed the final terms of the proposed definitive agreement between Poshmark and NAVER. Representatives of Goodwin\nalso reminded the Board of the employment and compensation discussions between Mr. Chandra and NAVER, noting that, as previously authorized by\nthe Board, Mr. Chandra had engaged in discussions with NAVER, with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin participating in certain\ndiscussions at the request of the Board and Transaction Committee, and summarized the key terms of Mr. Chandra\u2019s post-closing employment with\nNAVER and related compensation arrangement. Such arrangements are described in further detail in the section titled \u201cNew Arrangements with Company\nExecutive Officers.\u201d Members of the Transaction Committee then presented the formal recommendation of the Transaction Committee with respect to the\nproposed transaction, including that it was the Transaction Committee\u2019s determination to favorably recommend that the Board approve the proposed\ntransaction. At the request of the Board and Transaction Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board its financial analysis of\nthe Company and the proposed Merger Consideration of $17.90 per share of Company common stock in cash and delivered to the Board an oral opinion,\nwhich was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated October 3, 2022, to the effect that, as of October 3, 2022 and based upon and\nsubject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $17.90 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than\nNAVER and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point\nof view to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion, please see the section titled \u201cOpinion of Goldman Sachs.\u201d After\ndiscussions of the proposed transaction with NAVER and the matters summarized for the Board at the meeting, the Board then unanimously (i)\ndetermined that it was in the best interests of Poshmark and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement with NAVER\nand consummate the merger, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement with NAVER, (iii) recommended that Poshmark\nstockholders adopt the merger agreement with NAVER and (iv) directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of Poshmark stockholders at a\nspecial meeting of Poshmark stockholders.\nAfter the Board meeting on October 3, 2022, Poshmark and NAVER executed and delivered the merger agreement, and Mr. Chandra, Mayfield XIII,\nMayfield Select, GGV Capital V L.P. and GGV Capital V Entrepreneurs Fund L.P executed and delivered voting and support agreements. Subsequent to the\nexecution of the merger agreement and the voting and support agreements, Poshmark and NAVER issued a press release publicly announcing the\ntransaction.\n \n-42-\nTable of Contents\nReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Poshmark Board",

            "text": "Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Poshmark Board\nThe Board carefully reviewed and considered the proposed Merger in consultation with Poshmark\u2019s senior management and legal and financial\nadvisors and, upon the unanimous recommendation of the Transaction Committee, the Board unanimously: (1) determined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger\u037e (2) approved the\nexecution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations\nand the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger\u037e (3) resolved to recommend that the Company\u2019s\nstockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL\u037e and (4) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for\nconsideration by the Company\u2019s stockholders at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, the Board recommends that stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d adoption of the\nMerger Agreement at the Special Meeting. \nIn reaching their decision to approve the Merger Agreement, and to recommend that Poshmark stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the\nBoard and the Transaction Committee considered the following positive reasons to support the Merger Agreement:\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the price of $17.90 per share in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate and attractive value and liquidity to\nPoshmark stockholders\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe financial strength of NAVER and its ability to fund the Merger Consideration with cash on hand\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe absence of any financing condition in the Merger Agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of Poshmark common stock, including the market performance of Poshmark Class A common stock in\nlight of current industry, market and macroeconomic conditions, and the fact that the $17.90 per share to be received by Poshmark\nstockholders in the Merger represents a substantial premium of approximately 15% of Poshmark\u2019s Class A common stock closing price as of\nOctober 3, 2022, a 34% premium to the 30-day VWAP and a 48% to the 90-day VWAP of Poshmark Class A common stock\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe belief that the $17.90 per share in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to Poshmark stockholders on a risk-adjusted, time-\nadjusted basis than the other alternatives reasonably available to Poshmark, including\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe continued operation of Poshmark on a standalone basis and the pursuit of other potential actionable strategic or\nfinancial transactions, including an investment by and commercial partnership with Parent as discussed between the parties\nprior to exploring a potential sale transaction with Parent\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s assessment of Poshmark\u2019s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position and historical and projected\nfinancial performance, which assessment included consideration of the following factors among others: (i) Poshmark\u2019s\ngrowth rate and concerns about macroeconomic conditions\u037e (ii) nature of Poshmark\u2019s industry, including competition from a\nrange of competitors, including both online and offline retailers\u037e (iii) the need to continually innovate, improve and enhance\nPoshmark\u2019s platform in response to Poshmark users\u2019 evolving needs\u037e (iv) challenges Poshmark has faced in its standalone\nefforts to expand internationally\u037e (v) incremental regulatory requirements\u037e and (vi) the investments that would be required in\nconnection with Poshmark\u2019s long-term plan\u037e\n \n\u2022\npossible strategic transactions with third parties other than Parent, taking into account the financial capacity, risk of leaks,\nregulatory considerations and other execution risks associated with potential alternative bidders\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that a pre-signing market check, which included outreach to five strategic counterparties and one financial sponsor\ncounterparty, did not result in likely actionable interest within the foreseeable near term (as described in more detail under\nthe section titled \u201cThe Merger - Background of the Merger\u201d).\n \n-43-Table of Contents\n\u2022\nthe belief that, after negotiations with Parent and its representatives (as described in more detail under the section titled \u201cThe Merger -\nBackground of the Merger\u201d), $17.90 per share was the highest price that Parent was willing to pay as of the date of execution of the Merger\nAgreement and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to Poshmark, in the aggregate, to which Parent\nwould be willing to agree\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s assessment of the terms of the Merger Agreement relating to Poshmark\u2019s ability to respond to unsolicited acquisition\nproposals, including:\n \n\u2022\nPoshmark\u2019s right to provide non-public information in response to, and to discuss and negotiate, certain unsolicited\nacquisition proposals made before Company shareholder approval of the Merger is obtained\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nPoshmark\u2019s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement prior to obtaining Company shareholder approval of the Merger, in\nspecified circumstances relating to a superior proposal, subject to payment of a termination fee of $52,913,000, which the\nBoard believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and not an impediment to a competing transaction\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s assessment that the likelihood of completion of the Merger and the relatively low risk of regulatory challenges to the\ntransaction are significant factors in support of the transaction, in light of, among other things:\n \n\u2022\nthe lack of competitive overlaps between the businesses of Poshmark and Parent\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe obligations of Parent and Poshmark under the Merger Agreement to use reasonable best efforts to take all action\nreasonably necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act\napplicable to the Merger, including Parent\u2019s obligation to refrain from certain acquisition activity that would reasonably be\nexpected to exacerbate such challenges\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement and the fact that Parent has a substantial amount of cash on\nits balance sheet\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which the Board believes are reasonable and customary, and\nwhich, in the case of the conditions related to the accuracy of the Company\u2019s representations and warranties, are generally\nsubject to a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement - Representations and Warranties\u201d)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s consideration of the financial analyses presented by representatives of Goldman Sachs at the Board\u2019s meeting on October 3,\n2022, as well as the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated October 3,\n2022, to the effect that, as of October 3, 2022, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $17.90 in\ncash per share of Poshmark common stock to be paid to the holders (other than NAVER and its affiliates) of shares of Poshmark common\nstock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully\ndescribed under the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cOpinion of Goldman Sachs\u201d, which full text of the written opinion of Goldman\nSachs is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that Poshmark has sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary course prior to the consummation of the\nMerger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the definition of \u201cCompany Material Adverse Effect\u201d has a number of customary exceptions and is generally a high standard\napplied by courts\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe end date of April 3, 2023 (subject to extension under certain circumstances), which is expected to allow for sufficient time to complete\nthe Merger\u037e\n \n-44-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe availability of statutory appraisal rights to Poshmark stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\nand otherwise comply with all required procedures under the DGCL\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Agreement was approved by the Board, which is comprised of a majority of independent directors who are not\nemployees of Poshmark or any of its subsidiaries, and which received advice from the Company\u2019s outside financial and legal advisors in\nevaluating, negotiating and recommending the terms of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the consideration and negotiation of the Merger Agreement was conducted through extensive arm\u2019s-length negotiations\u037e\n \n\u2022\nPoshmark\u2019s rights to specific performance under the terms of the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that stockholders representing greater than a majority of the outstanding voting power of Poshmark\u2019s common stock entered into\nVoting Agreements concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Board and the Transaction Committee also considered, among other things, the following negative\nfactors:\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that Poshmark stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in Poshmark following the Merger (other than as described in\nthe section titled \u201cNew Arrangements with Company Executive Officers\u201d) and therefore will cease to participate in the future earnings of\ngrowth that Poshmark may achieve\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Agreement does not provide Poshmark with an opportunity to actively solicit alternative bids after entry into the\nMerger Agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe possibility that the Merger is not completed as a result of failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or the institution of regulatory\ninjunctions in the United States, or the failure of other closing conditions\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe risk and costs of stockholder or third-party litigation relating to the Merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe risks and costs to Poshmark if the Merger is not completed\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe potential uncertainty about the likelihood, timing or effects of completion of the Merger, including on Poshmark\u2019s stockholders,\nemployees, potential and existing customers, sellers, users and other parties, and the risk that such uncertainty may impair Poshmark\u2019s\nability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and could cause third parties to seek to change or not enter into business relationships\nwith Poshmark\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of Poshmark\u2019s business before completion of the Merger, generally requiring Poshmark to use reasonable\nbest efforts to conduct its business in the ordinary course and prohibiting Poshmark from taking certain specified actions, subject to\nspecific limitations, which may delay or prevent Poshmark from undertaking business opportunities, anticipated or not, that may arise\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger (many of which are\npayable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time and effort of Poshmark management required to complete the\nMerger, which may distract management, disrupt its business operations and have a negative effect on its financial results\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe possibility that Poshmark may be required to pay a termination fee equal to $52,913,000 under certain circumstances\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe other transaction costs to be incurred in connection with the Merger\u037e\n \n-45-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe fact that the receipt of cash by Poshmark stockholders in exchange for their shares of common stock will generally be a taxable\ntransaction to Poshmark stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe interests that certain Poshmark directors and executive officers may have with respect to the Merger, in addition to their interests as\nPoshmark stockholders generally, as described in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cInterests of Poshmark\u2019s Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger.\u201d\nThe preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board and the Transaction Committee is not, and is not\nintended to be, exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with their evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these\nmatters, the Board and the Transaction Committee did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to rank or assign relative\nweights to the various factors considered in reaching their respective determinations. In considering the factors described above and any other factors,\nindividual members of the Board and the Transaction Committee may have viewed factors differently or given different weight, merit or consideration to\ndifferent factors. In addition, the Board and the Transaction Committee did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular\nfactor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Board or the Transaction Committee, but\nrather the Board and the Transaction Committee conducted an overall review of the factors described above, including discussions with Poshmark\u2019s\nsenior management and legal and financial advisors.\nThe foregoing discussion of the reasoning of the Board and the Transaction Committee and certain information presented in this section is\nforward-looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section of this proxy statement titled\n\u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs",

Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on,\nand the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming\nits opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion.

The tables must be read together with the full text\nof each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative\ninformation, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before September 30, 2022, the last trading day before\nthe date of the public announcement of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nSummary of Material Financial Analysis of Goldman Sachs\nImplied Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia described below based on the $17.90 in cash per\nshare of Poshmark common stock to be paid to holders of shares of Poshmark common stock (other than NAVER and its affiliates) pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement.\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $17.90 in cash per share of Poshmark common stock relative to:\n \n\u2022\nthe closing price per share of Class A common stock as of September 30, 2022 (the last trading day before the date of the\npublic announcement of the Merger)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe VWAP per share of Class A common stock for the 30-day period ended September 30, 2022\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe VWAP per share of Class A common stock for the 90-day period ended September 30, 2022.\nThe results of these calculations and comparisons were as follows:\n \nPoshmark Class A Common Stock Reference Price Per Share\nImplied\nPremium\nRepresented\nby $17.90\nper\nShare of\nPoshmark\nClass A\nCommon\nStock\nSeptember 30, 2022 closing price of $15.67\n14%\nVWAP of $13.21 for the 30-day period ended on September 30, 2022\n36%\nVWAP of $12.01 for the 90-day period ended on September 30, 2022\n49%\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analyses. Goldman Sachs performed illustrative analyses of the implied present value of an\nillustrative future value per share of Poshmark common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value\nof Poshmark\u2019s equity as a function of Poshmark\u2019s financial multiples. For these analyses, Goldman Sachs used the Management Projections (including\nthe Tax Attributes Forecasts as provided by Poshmark\u2019s management) for each of the fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026. Goldman Sachs first\ncalculated the implied future enterprise values of Poshmark as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025 in two ways: first, by\napplying a range of enterprise values to Poshmark\u2019s next twelve months (\u201cNTM\u201d) revenue multiples (which is referred to as\n \n-48-\nTable of Contents\n\u201cEV/NTM revenue multiple\u201d) of 1.5x to 3.0x to estimates of Poshmark\u2019s revenue as reflected in the Management Projections for each of the fiscal years\n2023, 2024 and 2025 (the \u201cRevenue Multiple Method\u201d), and second, by applying a range of enterprise values to Poshmark\u2019s NTM gross profit multiples\n(which is referred to as \u201cEV/NTM gross profit multiple\u201d) of 1.75x to 3.50x to estimates of Poshmark\u2019s gross profit for each of the fiscal years 2023, 2024\nand 2025 (the \u201cGross Profit Multiple Method\u201d) as reflected in the Management Projections. These illustrative EV/NTM revenue multiples and illustrative\nEV/NTM gross profit multiples were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account, among other\nthings, current and historical EV/NTM revenue multiples and EV/NTM gross profit multiples for Poshmark, respectively, during the one-month, three-\nmonth, six-month and one-year periods ending September 30, 2022, and the period starting on the date of Poshmark\u2019s initial public offering and ending on\nSeptember 30, 2022.\nFor each of the Revenue Multiple Method and the Gross Profit Multiple Method, Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of\nPoshmark\u2019s projected debt and added the amount of Poshmark\u2019s projected cash (excluding funds payable to customers and the Suede One earnout\nestimate) as of December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, each as reflected in the Management Projections, from the range of respective implied enterprise values\nin order to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Poshmark as of December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025. In each case, Goldman Sachs then divided\nthese implied equity values by the projected number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock as of December 31, 2023, 2024 and\n2025, each as provided by Poshmark\u2019s management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Poshmark\u2019s management, using the treasury stock method,\nand NTM revenue multiples of 1.5x to 3.0x (with respect to the Revenue Multiple Method) and NTM gross profit multiples of 1.75x to 3.5x (with respect to\nthe Gross Profit Multiple Method), to derive a range of implied future equity values per share of Poshmark common stock.\nFor each of the Revenue Multiple Method and the Gross Profit Multiple Method, Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied future\nequity values back one and a half years, two and a half years, and three and a half years, respectively, using an illustrative discount rate of 15.0%,\nreflecting an estimate of Poshmark\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which\nrequires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for Poshmark, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets\ngenerally. These analyses resulted in a range of implied present values of $9.30 to $17.51 per share of Poshmark common stock under the Revenue\nMultiple Method and $9.12 to $17.15 per share of Poshmark common stock under the Gross Profit Multiple Method.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Management Projections including the Tax Attributes Forecasts, Goldman Sachs\nperformed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Poshmark to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Poshmark common stock.\nUsing the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 15.0%, reflecting estimates of Poshmark\u2019s weighted\naverage cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Poshmark for the third\nand fourth quarters of 2022 and the fiscal years 2023 through 2032 as reflected in the Management Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal\nvalues for Poshmark, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered\nfree cash flow to be generated by Poshmark, as reflected in the Management Projections (which analysis implied exit terminal year EV/revenue multiples\nranging from 1.1x to 1.8x). In addition, using discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 15.0%, reflecting an estimate of Poshmark\u2019s weighted average cost of\ncapital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 the estimated benefits of Poshmark\u2019s net operating losses for the ten-and-a-half-\nyear period through the year ending 2032, as reflected in the Tax Attributes Forecasts (as summarized in the section titled \u201cCertain Financial Projections\u201d).\nGoldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including\nPoshmark\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash\ntax rate and a beta for Poshmark, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of\n \n-49-\nTable of Contents\nperpetuity growth rates for Poshmark was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the\nManagement Projections and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation.\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Poshmark by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described\nabove. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Poshmark the debt of Poshmark as of June 30, 2022 of\n$0 and added the amount of Poshmark\u2019s cash (excluding funds payable to customers and the Suede One earnout estimate) of $433.5 million as of June 30,\n2022, in each case, as provided by Poshmark\u2019s management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Poshmark\u2019s management, and added the net present\nvalue of cash tax savings from net operating loss carryforwards, as reflected in the Management Projections including the Tax Attributes Forecasts, to\nderive a range of illustrative equity values for Poshmark. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of\nfully diluted outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock as of September 30, 2022, as provided by Poshmark\u2019s management and approved for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 use by Poshmark\u2019s management, using the treasury method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Poshmark\ncommon stock ranging from $12.19 to $17.71.\nPremia Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition\ntransactions announced during the time period from July 1, 2017 through September 30, 2022 involving a public company in the technology industry as\nthe target where the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were above $500 million. For the entire period, using publicly available information,\nGoldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in each of the 112 transactions relative to the target\u2019s\nlast undisturbed closing stock price prior to a leak or rumor of transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 32% across the period. This\nanalysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 23% and 75th percentile premium of 50% across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs\napplied a reference range of illustrative premia of 23% to 50% to the closing price per share of Class A common stock of $15.67 as of September 30, 2022\nand calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Poshmark common stock of $19.30 to $23.47.\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.\nSelecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and\ndid not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis\nof its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a\ncomparison is directly comparable to Poshmark or NAVER or the contemplated transaction.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Poshmark Board as to the fairness\nfrom a financial point of view to the holders (other than NAVER and its affiliates) of shares of Poshmark common stock as of the date of the opinion, of\nthe $17.90 in cash per share of Poshmark common stock to be paid to such holders, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These\nanalyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses\nbased upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the\ncontrol of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Poshmark, NAVER, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results\nare materially different from those forecasts.\nThe Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Poshmark and NAVER and was approved by the\nPoshmark Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Poshmark during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific\namount of consideration to Poshmark or the Poshmark Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only consideration for the\nMerger.\n \n-50-\nTable of Contents\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Poshmark Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Poshmark\nBoard in making its determination to approve the Merger. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses\nperformed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs\nattached as Annex B.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,\ninvestment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates\nand employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at\nany time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default\nswaps and other financial instruments of Poshmark, NAVER, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Mayfield Fund, L.L.C.\n(\u201cMayfield\u201d), a significant shareholder of Poshmark, and its affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be\ninvolved in the Merger. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial advisor to Poshmark in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations\nleading to, the Merger. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Poshmark and/or its affiliates from time to\ntime for which its Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as underwriter\nwith respect to the initial public offering of 7,590,000 shares of Poshmark\u2019s Class A common stock in January 2021. During the two-year period ended\nOctober 3, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking\nDivision to Poshmark and/or its affiliates of approximately $7.8 million. During the two-year period ended October 3, 2022, the Investment Banking\nDivision of Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by NAVER or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman\nSachs has recognized compensation. During the two-year period ended October 3, 2022, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been\nengaged by Mayfield or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation.\nGoldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Poshmark, NAVER, Mayfield, and their respective\naffiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies for which its Investment Banking Division may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also\nmay have co-invested with Mayfield and its affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Mayfield from\ntime to time and may do so in the future.\nThe Poshmark Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm\nthat has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 22, 2022, Poshmark engaged Goldman\nSachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with its evaluation of a potential strategic transaction, including the Merger. The engagement letter\nbetween Poshmark and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of\nannouncement, at approximately $35.2 million, $400,000 of which became payable in cash in quarterly installments with the first installment being payable\nthree months following the date of the engagement letter, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition,\nPoshmark has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its reasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify\nGoldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under federal securities laws.",

Furthermore, the Management Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Although the\nManagement Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by Poshmark\nmanagement with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as\nwell as matters specific to Poshmark\u2019s business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond Poshmark\u2019s\ncontrol. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from the results forecasted in the Management Projections, including, but not limited to, Poshmark\u2019s performance, industry\nperformance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse changes in applicable laws,\nregulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, and the various risks set forth in Poshmark\u2019s reports filed with the SEC.\nThere can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than the\nManagement Projections. The Management Projections cover several years, and such information by its nature becomes increasingly unreliable with\neach successive year. In addition, the Management Projections will be affected by Poshmark\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets\nover the applicable periods. The Management Projections reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and cannot,\ntherefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such. The inclusion of the Management\nProjections should not be regarded as an indication that Poshmark, Goldman Sachs, NAVER, their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors, or\nother representatives or anyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable prediction of future events, and this\ninformation should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an\nindication that the Management Projections will be necessarily predictive of actual future events.\nNone of Poshmark, the Board, Goldman Sachs, NAVER or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any\nrepresentation or warranty to any stockholder regarding the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the Management Projections or the\nultimate performance of Poshmark relative to the Management Projections. In the view of Poshmark management, the Management Projections were\nprepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best currently available estimates and judgments of Poshmark management at the time and presented, to the\nbest of Poshmark management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and Poshmark\u2019s expected future financial performance as of the date\nsuch information was prepared.\nThe Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information about\nPoshmark contained in Poshmark\u2019s public filings with the SEC. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned - \u201cWhere\nYou Can Find More Information.\u201d In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, Poshmark stockholders\nare cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.\nThe Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the published\nguidelines of the SEC regarding projections or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or the guidelines established by\nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to the preparation or presentation of Management Projections. The Management\nProjections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Poshmark management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nhas not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying Management Projections and,\naccordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\n \n-53-\nTable of Contents\nThe PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference into this proxy statement relates to the Company\u2019s previously issued financial\nstatements. It does not extend to the Management Projections and should not be read to do so.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Unburdened by SBC) and Unlevered Free Cash Flow contained in the Management Projections summarized above are \u201cnon-\nGAAP financial measures,\u201d which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used in the Management Projections were relied upon by Goldman Sachs, as directed by the Board and as provided by Poshmark\u2019s\nmanagement and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Poshmark\u2019s management, for purposes of its opinion and by the Board and the Transaction\nCommittee in connection with their evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination\nsuch as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures\nwere not relied upon by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its opinion or by the Board or the Transaction Committee in connection with their evaluation of\nthe Merger. Accordingly, Poshmark has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Management Projections to the relevant\nGAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information\npresented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Poshmark may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by\nother companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required\nto be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative\nto, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe summary of such information above is included solely to give Poshmark stockholders access to the information that was made available to the\nBoard of Directors, the Transaction Committee, Goldman Sachs, Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub, and is not included in this proxy statement in\norder to influence any Poshmark stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal\nrights with respect to their shares of Poshmark common stock. In addition, the Management Projections have not been updated, corrected or otherwise\nrevised to reflect transactions, events, information or results after the date they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as\nrequired by applicable securities laws, none of Poshmark, the Board, Goldman Sachs, NAVER nor any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other\nrepresentatives intend to, and each of them disclaims any obligations to update, correct or otherwise revise the Management Projections if any or all of it\nhas changed or changes, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. Since the Management Projections\nwere created, Poshmark has made publicly available its actual results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022. You should review\nPoshmark\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2022 for this information.",

Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, however, certain executive\nofficers of the Company may have discussions, or may enter into agreements with, Parent, the Company or their respective affiliates regarding\nemployment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates.\n \n-61-\nTable of Contents\nNew Arrangements with Company Executive Officers\nEmployment Term Sheet\nOn October 3, 2022, Mr. Chandra entered into a binding employment term sheet with Merger Sub (the \u201cEmployment Term Sheet\u201d) pursuant to\nwhich Mr. Chandra will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the surviving corporation and will be appointed to the board of directors of Proton Parent,\neffective as of the date on which the closing occurs (the \u201cclosing date\u201d). Under the Employment Term Sheet, Mr. Chandra will be entitled to an annual\nbase salary of $425,000 and be eligible for a target annual bonus equal to 100% of his base salary.\nUnder the Employment Term Sheet, all Unvested Company RSUs held by Mr. Chandra, valued at approximately $10,000,000, will fully vest as of the\nclosing date and be converted into the right to receive on the day following the closing date a number of fully vested shares of Proton Parent common\nstock having an equivalent fair market value as of the closing date.\nMr. Chandra will also be granted an option to purchase a number of shares of Proton Parent common stock (the \u201cNew Hire Options\u201d), having an\naggregate grant date fair market value equal to (a) (i) the Company\u2019s equity value as of the closing date, divided by (ii) the Company\u2019s enterprise value as\nof the closing date, multiplied by (b) $32,500,000. By way of example for illustrative purposes only, if the Company\u2019s equity value as of the closing date is\n$1,634 million (which is what it approximately was as of the date of signing of the Merger Agreement), and the Company\u2019s enterprise value as of the\nclosing date is $1,200 million (which is what it approximately was as of the date of signing of the Merger Agreement), then the aggregate grant date fair\nmarket value of the shares subject to the New Hire Options would be $44,254,167. The exercise price of the New Hire Options shall be equal to the fair\nmarket value as of the date of grant of the underlying shares of Proton Parent common stock. The New Hire Options will vest as follows, subject to Mr.\nChandra\u2019s continued employment as CEO through the applicable vesting date:\n \n\u2022\n25% upon Proton Parent (or the surviving corporation) filing a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC with respect to an initial\npublic offering of Proton Parent (or the surviving corporation) (\u201cIPO\u201d),\n \n\u2022\n25% upon consummation of an IPO, and\n \n\u2022\n50% on the 180th day following consummation of an IPO.\nUpon the occurrence of a change in control, any unvested New Hire Options will become fully vested, subject to Mr. Chandra\u2019s continued\nemployment as Chief Executive Officer through such change in control. In the event of a termination of Mr. Chandra\u2019s employment (i) by the surviving\ncorporation without cause, (ii) due to Mr. Chandra\u2019s death or disability or (iii) by Mr. Chandra with good reason, any outstanding and unvested New Hire\nOptions will remain outstanding and eligible to vest if a vesting date (as described above) or a change in control occurs during the 12-month period\nfollowing such termination.\nAdditionally, if (i) neither a change in control nor an IPO has occurred by the fifth anniversary of the closing date (the \u201cPut Date\u201d) and (ii) the\nenterprise value of Proton Parent as of the Put Date is at least equal to 1.5 times the enterprise value of Proton Parent as of the closing date, then Mr.\nChandra will have the right, during the one-year period following the Put Date, to require Proton Parent to repurchase all of the shares of Proton Parent\ncommon stock held by Mr. Chandra as of the date of exercise of the put right (including any shares of Proton Parent common stock issuable upon the\nexercise of unforfeited New Hire Options, subject to certain exceptions) at the most recent fair market valuation of such shares. The put right expires on\nthe earliest to occur of an IPO, a change in control and the sixth anniversary of the closing date.\nIn the event of a termination of Mr. Chandra\u2019s employment by the surviving corporation without cause or by Mr. Chandra with good reason,\nsubject to Mr. Chandra signing and not revoking a release in favor of the surviving corporation, Mr. Chandra will receive severance consisting of: (i) 12\nmonths (or 18 months, if\n \n-62-\nTable of Contents\nterminated within 12 months of the closing date) of base salary, (ii) prorated target annual bonus for the year of termination and (iii) 12 months (or 18\nmonths, if terminated within 12 months of the closing date) of COBRA continuation coverage. These severance benefits will, as of the closing, supersede\nand replace any entitlement Mr. Chandra previously had under the Severance Plan.\nThe Employment Term Sheet also provides that the parties will negotiate in good faith to enter into an employment agreement prior to the closing\ndate.\nHoldback Agreement\nIn connection with the Employment Term Sheet, Mr. Chandra entered into a Holdback Agreement pursuant to which $20,000,000 of the Merger\nConsideration otherwise payable to Mr. Chandra (the \u201cPre-Tax Holdback Amount\u201d), less the amount of taxes owed by Mr . Chandra on the Pre-Tax\nholdback Amount (such amount, the \u201cPost-Tax Holdback Amount\u201d), will be placed into an escrow account at the closing date. The Post-Tax Holdback\nAmount will be paid to Mr. Chandra in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date, subject to Mr. Chandra\u2019s\ncontinued employment with Parent or any of its subsidiaries through each applicable payment date. If Mr. Chandra\u2019s employment with Parent or any of its\nsubsidiaries is terminated prior to the third anniversary of the closing date (i) by the surviving corporation without cause, (ii) due to Mr. Chandra\u2019s death\nor disability or (iii) by Mr. Chandra with good reason, then any remaining portion of the Post-Tax Holdback Amount held in escrow will no longer be\nsubject to forfeiture and will be paid to Mr. Chandra within 30 days following such termination. Upon any termination of his employment other than as set\nforth in the immediately preceding sentence, any portion of the Post-Tax Holdback Amount that has not become deliverable as of such termination will be\nforfeited.\nIn connection with the negotiation of the Employment Term Sheet and Holdback Agreement, Mr. Chandra retained his own legal counsel and the\nPoshmark Board approved reimbursement of the costs and expenses to be incurred by Mr. Chandra in connection therewith up to an amount equal to\n$75,000.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Poshmark\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and\ncoverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies.

This discussion is for general informational purposes only and\ndoes not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences of the Merger. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the\nU.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial decisions and administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement\nand all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect\nthe accuracy of the statements set forth herein. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have not sought,\nand do not intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (referred to herein as the \u201cIRS\u201d) regarding any of the tax issues discussed herein.\nThere can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences of the Merger described in this proxy statement.\nThis discussion assumes that holders of Poshmark common stock hold their shares as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the\nCode (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a\nparticular holder of Poshmark common stock in light of such holder\u2019s individual circumstances, nor does it address U.S. state or local,\n \n-63-Table of Contents\nnon-U.S., or estate or gift taxes, the alternative minimum tax, the rules regarding qualified small business stock within the meaning of Section 1202 of the\nCode, the Medicare tax on net investment income or any other aspect of any U.S. federal tax other than the income tax. This discussion also does not\naddress tax considerations that may be relevant to holders of Poshmark common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws,\nsuch as, for example, financial institutions, brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, mutual funds, partnerships or other entities or arrangements\nclassified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities and their partners or members, S corporations, tax-exempt\norganizations, governmental organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market\nmethod of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S.\nfederal income tax, U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired their Poshmark common stock\nthrough the exercise of Company stock options or otherwise as compensation, holders who hold their Poshmark common stock as part of a hedge,\nstraddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, real estate\ninvestment trusts, regulated investment companies, holders deemed to sell their shares of Poshmark common stock under the constructive sale\nprovisions of the Code, persons who own (directly, indirectly or constructively) an equity interest in Parent or the surviving corporation and holders who\nexercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger under the DGCL.\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Poshmark common stock, the tax treatment of a\npartner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and activities of the partner and the partnership.

Merger Agreement, request that all non-public information previously\nprovided by or on behalf of Poshmark or any of its subsidiaries to any third party with whom a confidentiality agreement was

lead to a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties\nunder applicable Law and (ii) did not result from a breach of the no-shop provisions, subject to compliance with the no-shop provisions in the Merger\nAgreement, the Company is entitled to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with and furnish any non-public information relating to the\nCompany or any of its subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal. The Company will provide to Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub\nany non-public information, data and/or access that is provided to any person given such information, data and/or access that was not previously made\navailable to Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub prior to or promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following the time it is provided to such person.\nFrom and after the date of the Merger Agreement, Poshmark agreed to as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent\nin writing of Poshmark\u2019s receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (or inquiries, proposals, indications of interest or offers that could reasonably be expected to\nlead to an Acquisition Proposal).

For purposes of the reference to an \u201cAcquisition Proposal\u201d in this definition, all references to\n\u201c20%\u201d in the definition of \u201cAcquisition Transaction\u201d will be deemed to

acquisition proposal and one occasion per material modification thereto).\nIn addition, neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company may enter into an Alternative Acquisition

Board may make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to (i) a Superior Proposal\nthat did not result from a breach of the no-solicitation provision of the Merger Agreement, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its\nfinancial advisors and outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, or (ii) any\nmaterial change, event, effect, development or circumstance occurring or becoming known after the date of the Merger Agreement that was not known or\nreasonably foreseeable or the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board on the date of the Merger\nAgreement and does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto

Company to Parent advising Parent that the Poshmark Board intends to\nresolve to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an

conditions of such Superior Proposal and copies of all agreements, term sheets, financing\ncommitments and any other documents or written communications relating to such Superior Proposal (with any amendment to the financial\nterms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal requiring a new notice of superior proposal with a new notice period of three\nbusiness days)\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nunless during such five business day period (or three business day period following an amended proposal), the Company agreed to\nnegotiate with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such\nadjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement such that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation\nChange and/or terminate the Merger Agreement, as applicable, would no longer be inconsistent with the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under\napplicable law.\nIn the case of an Intervening Event, no adverse recommendation change may be made:\n \n\u2022\nuntil after the fifth business day following written notice from the Company to Parent advising Parent that the Poshmark Board or any\ncommittee of the Poshmark Board intends to take such action and specifying the basis for such change in the Company Board\nRecommendation\u037e\n \n\u2022\nunless, prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its representatives, during such five business\nday period, agreed to negotiate with Parent and its representatives in good faith to enable Parent to propose adjustments to the terms and\nconditions of the Merger Agreement such that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would no longer be\ninconsistent with the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under applicable law\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nunless, at the end of such five business day period and prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company\nBoard has considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to the terms of this Agreement, and has determined in\ngood faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that the failure to effect a Company Board\nRecommendation Change would continue to be inconsistent with the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under applicable law if such changes\nproposed by Parent were to be given effect.\nAs used in the Merger Agreement, the term \u201cAlternative Acquisition Agreement\u201d means any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,\nmerger agreement, acquisition agreement or other contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.\nReasonable Best Efforts\u037e

            "text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS\nGeneral\nUnder the DGCL, you have the right to demand appraisal and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your shares of Poshmark common\nstock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in lieu of the\nconsideration you would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in Section 262\nof the DGCL described herein. These rights are known as appraisal rights. Stockholders of record and beneficial owners electing to exercise appraisal\nrights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures is\nrequired to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.\nThis section is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights. The following discussion,\nhowever, is not a complete summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262\nof the DGCL that is accessible at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and incorporated\nby reference herein. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. The\nfollowing discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not a Poshmark stockholder\nof record or beneficial owners should exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nSubject to certain exceptions specified in Section 262 of the DGCL and summarized below, holders of record, and beneficial owners, of shares of\nPoshmark common stock who: (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such person\u2019s shares to the Company prior to the vote on the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement\u037e (2) have not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights\u037e (3)\ncontinuously are the record holders or beneficial holders, as applicable, of such shares through the Effective Time\u037e and (4) otherwise comply with the\napplicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of such shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of\nvalue arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) as of the completion of the Merger instead of the Merger Consideration. Any such\nPoshmark stockholder of record or beneficial holder awarded \u201cfair value\u201d for the holder\u2019s shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value in\ncash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to receive the Merger Consideration. It is possible that any such \u201cfair value\u201d as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, that which Poshmark stockholders of record and beneficial owners will receive\npursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nSection 262 of the DGCL requires that stockholders as of the record date for notice of the Special Meeting to vote on the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less than 20 days before the Special Meeting. Either a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL\nor information directing stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription\nor cost must be included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to the Company\u2019s stockholders of the availability of appraisal\nrights in connection with the Merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of the applicable statutory provisions\nis accessible at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. \nStockholders of record and beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights or who wish to preserve the right to do so should review the\nfollowing summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully. Failure to comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and\nproper\n \n-96-Table of Contents\nmanner will result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the\nCompany unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the Poshmark stockholders of record and beneficial owners seeking appraisal.\nBecause of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, stockholders of record and beneficial owners who wish to\nexercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their own legal and financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the\nDGCL. A Poshmark stockholder of record and beneficial owner who loses, waives or otherwise fails to properly exercise his, her, their or its appraisal\nrights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.\nHow to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights\nIf you are a Poshmark stockholder of record of a beneficial holder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of Poshmark\ncommon stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:\n \n\u2022\nYou must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. This\nwritten demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement. Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand\nfor appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder of\nrecord or beneficial holder and the intention of such holder to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A failure by such holder to make a\nwritten demand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is taken will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights\u037e\n \n\u2022\nIn the case of a stockholder of record, you must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A vote\nin favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, by proxy submitted by mail, over the Internet or by telephone, will constitute a waiver of\nyour appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A proxy which\ndoes not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Therefore, a\nstockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must instruct the proxy to vote against the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. In the case of a beneficial owner, you must not\ninstruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your share(s), or abstain from voting, in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nYou must continuously hold or beneficially own, as applicable, shares of Poshmark common stock from the date of making the demand\nthrough the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer the shares before the Effective Time\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nYou must otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, including the requirement that you, another stockholder who\nhas complied with the requirements of Section 262 or the Company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Company is under no obligation to file any petition\nand has no present intention of doing so.\nIf you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, but you\nwill have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Poshmark common stock.\nIn addition, because Poshmark\u2019s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange and is expected to continue to be listed on such\nexchange immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares of\nPoshmark common stock, unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock\neligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million.\nWe refer to conditions (1) and (2) as the \u201cownership thresholds.\u201d At least\n \n-97-\nTable of Contents\none of the ownership thresholds must be met in order for Company stockholders to be entitled to seek appraisal with respect to such shares of Poshmark\ncommon stock.\nIn the case of a record holder of shares of Company common stock, voting, via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy, against,\nabstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by\nSection 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal is in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote. If you want to exercise your appraisal\nrights, you must not vote your shares via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.\nIn the case of a beneficial owner of Company common stock, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d\nfor their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote those shares on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement without\nspecific voting instructions from the beneficial owner on such proposal, but such brokers, banks or other nominees will vote such shares as instructed if\nthe beneficial owner provides such instructions. If a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d instructs such person\u2019s\nbroker, bank or other nominee to vote such person\u2019s shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, and does not revoke\nsuch instruction prior to the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, then such shares will be voted in favor of the approval\nand adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of such beneficial owner\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously\ndelivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, if you are a beneficial owner of Company common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, you\nmust either not provide any instructions to such person\u2019s broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger\nAgreement or must instruct such broker, bank or other nominee to vote against the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from\nvoting on such proposal.\nWho May Exercise Appraisal Rights\nA holder of record or beneficial owner of shares of Poshmark common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time may\nassert appraisal rights for the shares of Poshmark common stock held of record or beneficially in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the stockholder of record or beneficial owner, as applicable, and must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the\nstockholder of record or beneficial owner and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its common stock. In addition, in the case of\na demand for appraisal made by a beneficial owner, the demand must (1) reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is\nmade, (2) provide documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and\ncorrect copy of what it purports to be and (3) provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and\nto be set forth on the verified list of persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares pursuant to Section 262(f) of the DGCL. A holder of record,\nsuch as a bank, broker or other nominee, who holds shares of Poshmark common stock as a nominee or intermediary for others, may exercise his, her or its\nright of appraisal with respect to the shares of Poshmark common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other\nbeneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Poshmark common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where\nno number of shares of Poshmark common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Poshmark common stock\nheld in the name of the holder of record.\nIf the shares are owned of record or beneficially owned in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such\ndemand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner or beneficial owner, and if you own shares of Poshmark common stock jointly with one or\nmore other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An\nauthorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record\u037e however, the agent\nmust identify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the holder\nor holders of record.\n \n-98-\nTable of Contents\nIf you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand to:\nPoshmark, Inc.\n203 Redwood Shores Parkway, 8th Floor\nRedwood City, California 94065\nAttention: General Counsel and Corporate Secretary\nSurviving Corporation\u2019s Actions After Completion of the Merger\nIf the Merger is consummated, the surviving corporation will give written notice of the Effective Time within ten days after the Effective Time to\nPoshmark stockholders of record or beneficial owners who did not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who made a written\ndemand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Company stockholder of\nrecord or beneficial owner that made a demand for appraisal but did not commence an appraisal proceeding or join in such a proceeding as a named party\nwill have the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares of\nPoshmark common stock, but after such 60-day period a demand for appraisal may be withdrawn only with the written approval of the surviving\ncorporation. In addition, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder of record or beneficial owner\nwithout the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, which approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e\nprovided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any Poshmark stockholder of record or beneficial owner that has made an appraisal\ndemand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. Within 120 days after the\nEffective Time, either a record holder or a beneficial owner of Poshmark common stock, provided such person has complied with the requirements of\nSection 262 of the DGCL and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the surviving corporation must commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a\npetition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or\nbeneficial owner, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of Poshmark common stock held by all stockholders of record and beneficial owners\nwho have properly demanded appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file an appraisal petition and has no present intention of\ndoing so. If you desire to have your shares appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the\ntime periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder of record or beneficial owner who has complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the\nDGCL will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of\nPoshmark common stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Poshmark has received demands for\nappraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares. The surviving corporation must give this statement to you within the later of (1) ten days\nafter receipt by the surviving corporation of the request therefor or (2) ten days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you\nare the beneficial owner of shares of Poshmark common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee or intermediary on your behalf, you may, in your own\nname, file an appraisal petition or request from the surviving corporation the statement described in this paragraph.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record or beneficial owner of Poshmark common stock who has properly exercised\nhis, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving\ncorporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with\nwhom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been\n \n-99-\nTable of Contents\nreached by the surviving corporation. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine which stockholders of record and beneficial owners are\nentitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders of record and beneficial owners demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares to submit\ntheir stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of\nChancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. The Delaware Court of Chancery will also dismiss\nproceedings as to all Poshmark stockholders of record and beneficial owners if neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met. Where\nproceedings are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal is not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of\nPoshmark common stock owned by such stockholders of record and beneficial owners, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nincluding any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value of the shares of\nPoshmark common stock at the Effective Time held by all Poshmark stockholders of record and beneficial owners who have properly perfected appraisal\nrights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any. Unless the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the\njudgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time\nto time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any\npoint prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder of record\nand beneficial owner entitled to appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the\nDGCL, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary\ncash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest accrued on the amount of the voluntary\ncash payment before such payment was made, unless such interest was paid at the time the voluntary cash payment is made. When the value is\ndetermined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, less any amounts already paid in a voluntary cash payment, with\ninterest thereon, if any, to the stockholders of Poshmark of record and beneficial owners entitled to receive the same.\nIn determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the\nDelaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value\nby any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d\nThe Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which were known, or which could be ascertained as of the date of the\nMerger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative\nelements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to\nmean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not\nthe product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nYou should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Poshmark common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more\nthan, the same as, or less than the value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement and that an opinion of an investment\nbanking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner\naddress, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.\n \n-100-\nTable of Contents\nMoreover, neither Poshmark nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Poshmark stockholder exercising appraisal\nrights and reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Poshmark common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. No\nrepresentation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nIf no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in\nrespect of such shares, then all Poshmark stockholders of record and beneficial owners will lose the right to an appraisal and will instead receive the\nMerger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate those costs to the parties as the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances. Each Poshmark stockholder of record and beneficial owner party to the appraisal\nproceeding is responsible for its own attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witnesses\u2019 fees and expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder of record and beneficial owner in connection with the appraisal\nproceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all\nshares of Poshmark common stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a\nreservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.\nIf you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after the Effective Time, vote the shares\nsubject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to\nholders of record of Poshmark common stock as of a record date prior to the Effective Time.\nIf you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may withdraw a demand for appraisal and\naccept the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration to the\nsurviving corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the surviving\ncorporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder of record or beneficial owner without\nthe approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided,\nhowever, that this provision will not affect the right of any Poshmark stockholder of record or beneficial owner that has made an appraisal demand but\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to\naccept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If you fail to perfect, successfully withdraw\nyour demand for appraisal, waiver or otherwise lose the appraisal right, your shares of Poshmark common stock will be converted into the right to receive\nthe Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In that\nevent, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your shares of Poshmark common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement\nwithout interest. In view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a Poshmark stockholder of record or beneficial owner\nand are considering exercising your appraisal rights under the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and financial advisor.\nThe process of demanding and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with the prerequisites of Section 262 of the DGCL. If you wish to\nexercise your appraisal rights, you are urged to consult with your own legal and financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL will govern.\n \n-101-\nTable of Contents\nHOUSEHOLDING",
